1,1,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow disruption with the WEB-DL device has been used safely for the treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. The stability of aneurysm occlusion after this treatment was evaluated in the short and midterm, but not in the long term. This retrospective multicenter European study is the continuation of an already published series dealing with short- and midterm anatomic results and analyzes long-term data in patients treated with the WEB-DL MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve European neurointerventional centers initially participated in the study. In addition to data collected for the initial publication, images obtained at long-term follow-up were collected and independently analyzed by the same experienced interventional neuroradiologist. RESULTS: Of the initial 45 patients, 26 (20 women and 6 men; 35-73 years of age; mean, 55.2 +/- 10.6 years; median, 55.5 years) with 26 aneurysms treated with the WEB-DL device had long-term follow-up (median, 27.4 months). Three of 26 patients (11.5%) were retreated between short- and midterm follow-up, and none, between mid- and long-term follow-up. Long-term aneurysm occlusion in the 19 patients treated with the WEB only and not retreated during follow-up was complete occlusion in 13/19 patients (68.4%), including aneurysms with opacification of the proximal recess in 9/19 patients (47.4%), neck remnant in 3/19 patients (15.8%), and aneurysm remnant in 3/19 patients (15.8%). In all patients (100.0%), aneurysm occlusion was stable between midterm and long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that WEB treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms offers long-term stable occlusion.",WEB-DL Endovascular Treatment of Wide-Neck Bifurcation Aneurysms: Long-Term Results in a European Series,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,26228882,['angiography'],2.182890855,angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.182890855,"['intracranial aneurysms', 'flow-disruption', 'device', 'trial', 'feasibility']",aneurysms
2,2,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether early changes in tumor volume and perfusion measurements derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) may predict response to antiangiogenic therapy in recurrent high-grade gliomas. Twenty-seven patients who received bevacizumab every 3 weeks were enrolled in the study. For each patient, three MRI scans were performed: at baseline, after the first dose, and after the fourth dose of bevacizumab. The entire tumor volume (V-tot), as well as contrast-enhanced and noncontrast-enhanced tumor subvolumes (VCE-T1 and VNON-CE-T1, respectively) were outlined using post-contrast T1-weighted images as a guide for the tumor location. Histogram analysis of normalized IAUGC (nIAUGC) and transfer constant K-trans maps were performed. Each patient was classified as a responder patient if he/she had a partial response or a stable disease or as a nonresponder patient if he/she had progressive disease. Responding patients showed a larger reduction in VNON-CE-T1 after a single dose, compared to nonresponding patients. Tumor subvolumes with increased values of nIAUGC and K-trans, after a single dose, significantly differed between responders and nonresponders.

4,4,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the early stages of idiopathic Parkinson disease, motor symptoms are usually asymmetric. We aimed to assess the feasibility of nigrosome 1 detection at 3T MR imaging to analyze the agreement of its asymmetry and clinical laterality.

The nigrosome 1 detection findings by using the MR imaging data were rated as ""normal,"" ""possibly abnormal,"" and ""abnormal"" by 2 independent reviewers. The degree of F-18-FP-CIT binding was visually assessed in the caudate nucleus and putamen on PET images. Clinical laterality was evaluated by scores of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Part III. Asymmetry of the affected nigrosome 1 and the degree of F-18-FP-CIT binding were analyzed for agreement with clinical laterality. RESULTS: The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the nigrosome 1 detection at 3T MR imaging was 100%, 84.6%, and 94.6%, respectively. Interrater agreements for the abnormality and asymmetry of nigrosome 1 were excellent (kappa = 0.863 and 0.835, respectively).

5,5,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid webs may cause recurrent ischemic stroke. We describe the prevalence, demographics, clinical presentation, imaging features, histopathology, and stroke risk associated with this under-recognized lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A carotid web was defined on CTA as a thin intraluminat filling defect along the posterior wall of the carotid bulb just beyond the carotid bifurcation on oblique sagittal section CTA that was seen as a septum on axial CTA. Using a prospective case series from April 2013 to April 2014, we describe the demographics, spectrum of imaging features on CTA, and histopathology of these carotid webs. From a retrospective analysis of patients at our center from May 2012 to April 2013 who had a baseline head and neck CTA followed by a brain MR imaging within 1-2 days of the CTA, we determine the period prevalence of carotid webs and the prevalence of ipsilateral stroke on imaging. RESULTS: In the prospective series, the mean age was 50 years (range, 41-55 years); 5/7 patients were women. Recurrent stroke was seen in 5/7 (71.4%) patients with the carotid web; time to recurrence ranged from 1 to 97 months. Histopathology suggested a high probability of fibromuscular dysptasia.

6,6,"ObjectiveTo compare corpus callosum area (CCA) and corpus callosum index (CCI) in terms of feasibility and their performance as biomarkers for cognitive and physical disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). A secondary aim was to compare these two methods with volumetric measurements. MethodsThis study was based on a cohort of 37 MS patients and a group of age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Physical disability was assessed with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and cognitive disability with the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). CCA and CCI were assessed on midsagittal brain MRI by 3 raters with varying radiological experience. Volumes of the brain, gray and white matter, corpus callosum, and MS lesions were acquired with Freesurfer and Lesion Segmentation Toolbox for Statistical Parametric Mapping. ResultsCCA and CCI were obtained within seconds with excellent intra- and inter-rater agreement, and outperformed volumetric measurements. CCA had the strongest correlations with both SDMT (r = .82, P < .001) and EDSS (r = -.56, P < .001), and the highest accuracy in differentiating patients from controls (95%) and relapse-remitting MS from progressive forms of MS (77%). CCI performed less well (r = .73, P < .001; r = -.45, P < .001; 94%; 71%). CCA also outperformed the volumetric measurements in these regards. ConclusionsCCA is a time-effective and robust biomarker that has stronger correlations with both EDSS and information processing speed than CCI and volumetric measurements that are commonly used as outcome measures in MS research and clinical trials.","MRI-Defined Corpus Callosal Atrophy in Multiple Sclerosis: A Comparison of Volumetric Measurements, Corpus Callosum Area and Index",JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2015,25786805,['MRI'],1.87032419,MRI,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,1.87032419,"['brain atrophy', 'size', 'corpus callosum area', 'corpus callosum index', 'cognition', 'sex', 'lesions', 'multiple sclerosis', 'mri']",athrophy

This study investigated the initial and midterm clinical and angiographic results of LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling in the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who were treated with LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling. Eighty patients with 80 wide-neck intracranial aneurysms were included in the study. Eleven patients (13.8%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. All patients were treated with LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling. Technical success and immediate postprocedural clinical and angiographic outcomes were evaluated. Seventy-three patients attended angiographic and clinical follow-up for a mean duration of 7.2 +/- 3.8 months. Periprocedural and delayed complications were reviewed. Preprocedural and follow-up clinical statuses were assessed by using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS: The technical success rate of the procedure was 97.5%. The immediate postprocedural angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the aneurysm in 75% of the 80 patients. The last follow-up angiograms showed complete occlusion in 85.7% of the 77 patients with an angiographic follow-up. Of the 77 patients with a follow-up angiography, 6.5% showed an increase in the filling status of the aneurysm and 5.2% required retreatment. The overall procedure-related complication rate, including asymptomatic complications, was 11.3%. The permanent morbidity rate was 3.8%. There was no mortality in this study.

11,11,"PURPOSETo examine intermethod reliabilities and differences between FreeSurfer and the FDA-cleared congener, NeuroQuant (R), both fully automated methods for structural brain MRI measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODSMRI scans from 20 normal control subjects, 20 Alzheimer's disease patients, and 20 mild traumatically brain-injured patients were analyzed with NeuroQuant (R) and with FreeSurfer. Intermethod reliability was evaluated. RESULTSPairwise correlation coefficients, intraclass correlation coefficients, and effect size differences were computed. NeuroQuant (R) versus FreeSurfer measures showed excellent to good intermethod reliability for the 21 regions evaluated (r: .63 to .99/ICC: .62 to .99/ES: -.33 to 2.08) except for the pallidum (r/ICC/ES = .31/.29/-2.2) and cerebellar white matter (r/ICC/ES = .31/.31/.08). Volumes reported by NeuroQuant were generally larger than those reported by FreeSurfer with the whole brain parenchyma volume reported by NeuroQuant 6.50% larger than the volume reported by FreeSurfer. There was no systematic difference in results between the 3 subgroups.

12,12,"OBJECTIVESThe clinical implications of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been thoroughly examined. To address this, we investigated the spatial distribution of WMH and their regional predilection in non-demented patients with mild PD. METHODSCognitive assessments classified the sample into patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n = 25) and patients with no cognitive impairment (PD-NCI, n = 65) based on the recent formal Movement Disorder Task Force diagnostic criteria. The mean age was 65.1 7.7 years, disease duration was 5.3 3.9 years, and Hoehn and Yahr stage was 1.9 +/- .4. WMHs were outlined on T2-weighted imaging using a semi-automated technique. The spatial distribution of WMHs were compared between PD-MCI and PD-NCI using voxel-wise lesion probability maps (LPM). General linear models examined the associations between spatially specific WMHs and cognitive domains. RESULTSLPM analyses showed significant differences in the spatial distribution of WMH in PD-MCI compared to PD-NCI in widespread regions of the brain (P < .05). PD-MCI demonstrated significantly greater total and periventricular WMHs compared to PD-NCI (P .02). Spatial distribution of WMHs was also significantly associated with global cognition, performance on the Frontal Assessment Battery and Fruit Fluency (P < .05). CONCLUSIONSVoxel-wise LPM analysis revealed differences in the spatial distribution of WMH between PD-MCI and PD-NCI patients, particularly in the periventricular regions. A more widespread extent of WMH might be indicative of cognitive deterioration.

13,13,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Use of the WEB intra-aneurysmal flow-disruption device in unruptured wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms has proven safety and efficacy. However, ruptured aneurysms are underrepresented in existing studies. This retrospective multicenter study describes the use of the WEB in patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten centers contributed to this study. Clinical and procedural data of 47 patients with 52 aneurysms were analyzed retrospectively together with follow-up angiographies. RESULTS: There were 37 anterior and 15 posterior circulation aneurysms with a neck size of >= 4 mm in 49 of 52 (94%) aneurysms; 45 (87%) aneurysms were <10 mm, and 2 were partially thrombosed. Successful placement of the WEB was possible in every case. Adjunctive devices were used in 8 of 52 (15%) aneurysms. Thromboembolic events were observed in 4 of 52 (8%) patients. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients with 16 aneurysms, 9 of which were potentially related to the WEB procedure (3 thromboembolic events, 5 protrusions, and 1 perforations; 2 perforations were caused by the wire or catheter), but none had a clinical impact. Four patients were retreated. Short-term follow-up in 25 of 39 patients revealed complete occlusion in 15 of 25 (60%), 5 of 25 (20%) with residual neck, and 5 of 25 (20%) with residual aneurysm filling. Short-to midterm imaging in 9 of 25 patients revealed complete occlusion in 5 (55.6%), residual neck in 2 (22%), and residual aneurysm filling in 2 (22%). Of 47 patients, 23 (49%) had an mRS score of 0, 1, or 2; 13 (28%) had an mRS score of 3 or 4; and none had an mRS score of 5 at discharge.

14,14,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSETo determine whether lesion to activation distance (LAD) on presurgical blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and degree of white matter involvement by primary or metastatic brain lesions predict perioperative motor and language deficits. METHODSWe retrospectively evaluated 76 patients with intra-axial brain lesions referred for presurgical fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We measured expressive, receptive, global language and motor LAD and assessed degree of involvement of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). We performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to determine whether the LAD and the degree of CST/SLF involvement were statistically significantly different between patients with and without preoperative or postoperative neurological deficits. RESULTSIn preoperatively symptomatic patients, motor and expressive language LAD were significantly lower (z = -3.78, P = .0002, and z = -2.51, P = .01, respectively) than in asymptomatic patients. No significant difference was noted in LAD between postoperative symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, except for a trend level effect for motor LAD (P = .07).

15,15,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusional kurtosis imaging is an MR imaging technique that provides microstructural information in biologic systems. Its application in clinical studies, however, is hampered by long acquisition and postprocessing times. Weevaluated a new and fast (2 minutes 46 seconds) diffusional kurtosis imaging method with regard to glioma grading, compared it with conventional diffusional kurtosis imaging, and compared the diagnostic accuracy of fast mean kurtosis (MK') to that of the widely used mean diffusivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MK' and mean diffusivity were measured in the contrast-enhancing tumor core, the perifocal hyperintensity (indicated on T2 FLAIR images), and the contralateral normal-appearing white and gray matter of 34 patients (22 with high-grade and 12 with low-grade gliomas). MK' and mean diffusivity in the different tumor grades were compared by using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the areas under the curve were calculated to determine the diagnostic accuracy of MK' and mean diffusivity. RESULTS: MK' in the tumor core, but not mean diffusivity, differentiated high-grade from low-grade gliomas, and MK' differentiated glioblastomas from the remaining gliomas with high accuracy (area under the curve(MK') = 0.842; P-MK' < .001). MK' and mean diffusivity identified glioblastomas in the group of high-grade gliomas with similar significance and accuracy (area under the curve(MK') = 0.886; area under the curve(mean diffusivity) = 0.876; P-MK' = .003; P-mean diffusivity = .004). The mean MK' in all tissue types was comparable to that obtained by conventional diffusional kurtosis imaging. CONCLUSIONS: The diffusional kurtosis imaging approach used here is considerably faster than conventional diffusional kurtosis imaging methods but yields comparable results. It can be accommodated in clinical protocols and enables exploration of the role of MK' as a biomarker in determining glioma subtypes or response evaluation.",Mean Diffusional Kurtosis in Patients with Glioma: Initial Results with a Fast Imaging Method in a Clinical Setting,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,25977481,['DTI'],2.241887906,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.241887906,"['cerebral gliomas', 'outcome prediction', 'brain', 'gaussian water diffusion']",tumor
16,16,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dual-energy CT is not used routinely for evaluation of the head and neck, and there is no consensus on the optimal virtual monochromatic image energies for evaluating normal tissues or head and neck cancer. We performed a quantitative evaluation to determine the optimal virtual monochromatic images for visualization of normal tissues, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and lymphadenopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual-energy CT scans from 10 healthy patients and 30 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated at different virtual monochromatic energy levels ranging from 40 to 140 keV. The signal-to-noise ratios of muscles at 6 different levels, glands (parotid, sublingual, submandibular, and thyroid), 30 tumors, and 17 metastatic lymph nodes were determined as measures of optimal image quality. Lesion attenuation and contrast-to-noise ratios (compared with those of muscle) were evaluated to assess lesion conspicuity. RESULTS: The optimal signal-to-noise ratio for all the tissues was at 65 keV (P < .0001). However, tumor attenuation (P < .0001), attenuation difference between tumor and muscles (P = .03), and lesion contrast-to-noise ratios (P < .0001) were highest at 40 keV. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal image signal-to-noise ratio is at 65 keV, but tumor conspicuity compared with that of muscle is greatest at 40 keV. Optimal evaluation of the neck may be best achieved by a multiparametric approach, with 65-keV virtual monochromatic images providing the best overall image quality and targeted use of 40-keV virtual monochromatic images for tumor evaluation.",Optimal Virtual Monochromatic Images for Evaluation of Normal Tissues and Head and Neck Cancer Using Dual-Energy CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,26021623,['CT'],2.300884956,CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.300884956,"['laryngeal', 'squamous-cell carcinoma', 'optimization', 'improve', 'artifacts']",tumor

While imaging features of human papillomavirus-positive versus human papillomavirus-negative squamous cell carcinoma nodal metastases have been described, characteristics distinguishing human papillomavirus-positive from human papillomavirus-negative primary squamous cell carcinomas have not been well established. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the use of texture features to distinguish human papillomavirus-positive and human papillomavirus-negative primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, 40 patients with primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and known human papillomavirus status who underwent contrast-enhanced CT between December 2009 and October 2013 were included in this study. Segmentation of the primary lesion was manually performed with a semiautomated graphical-user interface. Following segmentation, an in-house-developed texture analysis program extracted 42 texture features from each segmented volume. A t test was used to evaluate differences in texture parameters between human papillomavirus-positive and human papillomavirus-negative squamous cell carcinomas. RESULTS: Of the 40 included patients, 29 had human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and 11 had human papillomavirus-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Significant differences were seen in the histogram parameters median (P = .006) and entropy (P = .016) and squamous cell carcinoma entropy (P = .043).

METHODSMagnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the anatomy and function of major veins in the neck in 138 MS patients and 67 healthy controls (HC). Time-of-flight MR angiography (MRA) was used to assess stenosis while 2-dimensional phase-contrast flow quantification was used to assess flow at the C2/C3 and C5/C6 levels. Venous flow was normalized to the total arterial flow. The MS patients were divided into stenotic (ST) and nonstenotic (NST) groups based on MRA assessment, and each group was compared to the HC group in anatomy and flow. RESULTSThe MS group showed lower normalized internal jugular vein (IJV) blood flow (tIJV/tA) than the HC group (P < .001). In the MS group, 72 (52%) were classified as ST while 66 (48%) were NST.

We performed a prospective observational cohort study of 60 patients presenting with early stage parkinsonism and initial uncertain diagnosis.

21,21,"The prevalence of cerebral microbleeds was evaluated in 246 patients using T2* and SWI. Microbleeds were detected in 21% by SWI vs. 17% by T2* imaging. SWI performed well with both thin and thick sections. Thus, SWI is better than T2* for this purpose and robust enough to permit comparison across studies. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds are thought to have potentially important clinical implications in dementia and stroke. However, the use of both T2* and SWI MR imaging sequences for microbleed detection has complicated the cross-comparison of study results. We aimed to determine the impact of microbleed sequences on microbleed detection and associated clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from our memory clinic (n = 246; 53% female; mean age, 62) prospectively underwent 3T MR imaging, with conventional thick-section T2*, thick-section SWI, and conventional thin-section SWI. Microbleeds were assessed separately on thick-section SWI, thin-section SWI, and T2* by 3 raters, with varying neuroradiologic experience. Clinical and radiologic parameters from the dementia investigation were analyzed in association with the number of microbleeds in negative binomial regression analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence and number of microbleeds were higher on thick-/thin-section SWI (20/21%) compared with T2*(17%). There was no difference in microbleed prevalence/number between thick- and thin-section SWI. Interrater agreement was excellent for all raters and sequences.

21,21,"The prevalence of cerebral microbleeds was evaluated in 246 patients using T2* and SWI. Microbleeds were detected in 21% by SWI vs. 17% by T2* imaging. SWI performed well with both thin and thick sections. Thus, SWI is better than T2* for this purpose and robust enough to permit comparison across studies. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds are thought to have potentially important clinical implications in dementia and stroke. However, the use of both T2* and SWI MR imaging sequences for microbleed detection has complicated the cross-comparison of study results. We aimed to determine the impact of microbleed sequences on microbleed detection and associated clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from our memory clinic (n = 246; 53% female; mean age, 62) prospectively underwent 3T MR imaging, with conventional thick-section T2*, thick-section SWI, and conventional thin-section SWI. Microbleeds were assessed separately on thick-section SWI, thin-section SWI, and T2* by 3 raters, with varying neuroradiologic experience. Clinical and radiologic parameters from the dementia investigation were analyzed in association with the number of microbleeds in negative binomial regression analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence and number of microbleeds were higher on thick-/thin-section SWI (20/21%) compared with T2*(17%). There was no difference in microbleed prevalence/number between thick- and thin-section SWI. Interrater agreement was excellent for all raters and sequences. Univariate comparisons of clinical parameters between patients with and without microbleeds yielded no difference across sequences. In the regression analysis, only minor differences in clinical associations with the number of microbleeds were noted across sequences.

22,22,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether normal controls and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with and without planning deficits differ on white matter integrity. A total of 34 HIV-positive patients with planning deficits were compared with 13 HIV-positive patients without planning deficits and 19 gender-, age-, and education-matched control subjects. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed along 30 noncolinear directions in a 1.5-T scanner. For tract-based spatial statistics analysis, a white matter skeleton was created, and a permutation-based inference with 5000 permutations with a threshold of p < 0.05 was used to identify abnormalities in fractional anisotropy (FA). The median, radial, and axial diffusivities were also projected onto the mean FA skeleton. Compared with controls, HIV-positive patients with planning deficits had decreased FA in bilateral anterior thalamic radiations, bilateral inferior fronto-occiptal fasciculi, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral superior longitudinal fascicule, and bilateral uncinate fasciculi. Compared to HIV-positive patients without planning deficits, patients with planning deficits had decreased FA in bilateral anterior thalamic radiations, bilateral inferior fronto-occiptal fasciculi, genu of the corpus callosum, bilateral superior longitudinal fascicule, and right uncinate fascicule.

23,23,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Safety analyses in the French Observatory have shown that treatment of intracranial aneurysms by using flow disruption with the Woven EndoBridge Device (WEB) is safe, with low morbidity and no mortality. The objective of this study was to analyze treatment feasibility, complications, and safety results in patients treated with the Woven EndoBridge Device Dual-Layer (WEB DL) and Woven EndoBridge Device Single-Layer/Single-Layer Sphere (WEB SL/SLS) in the French Observatory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with bifurcation aneurysms were included in this prospective, multicenter good clinical practices study. A medical monitor independently analyzed procedural and clinical data. The study started with the WEB DL, and secondarily, the WEB SL/SLS was authorized in the study. RESULTS: Between November 2012 and January 2014, 10 French centers included 62 patients with 63 aneurysms. Thirty patients with 31 aneurysms were treated with the WEB DL, and 32 patients with 32 aneurysms, with the WEB SL/SLS. The percentage of anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with WEB SL/SLS was significantly higher (37.5%) compared with WEB DL (12.9%) (P = .04). The WEB SL/SLS was more frequently used in aneurysms of <10 mm than the WEB DL (respectively, 96.9% and 67.7%; P = .002). Morbidity was similar in both groups (WEB DL, 3.3%; WEB SL/SLS, 3.1%), and mortality was 0.0% in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This comparative study shows increased use of WEB treatment in ruptured, small, and anterior communicating artery aneurysms when using WEB SL/SLS. There was a trend toward fewer thromboembolic complications with the WEB SL/SLS. With both the WEB DL and WEB SL/SLS, the treatment was safe, with low morbidity and no mortality.","WEB Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: Feasibility, Complications, and 1-Month Safety Results with the WEB DL and WEB SL/SLS in the French Observatory",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,25655876,['angiography'],1.887905605,angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.887905605,"['coiling', 'endovascular treatment', 'stent', 'flow-disruption', 'device']",stenosis
24,24,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endoluminal reconstruction with the Pipeline Embolization Device is an effective treatment option for select intracranial aneurysms. However, concerns for the patency of eloquent branch arteries covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device have been raised. We aimed to examine the patency of the anterior choroidal artery and clinical sequelae after ICA aneurysm treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively analyzed all patients among our first 157 patients with ICA aneurysms treated by the Pipeline Embolization Device who required placement of at least 1 device across the ostium of the anterior choroidal artery. The primary outcome measure was angiographic patency of the anterior choroidal artery at last follow-up. Age, sex, type of aneurysm, neurologic examination data, number of Pipeline Embolization Devices used, relationship of the anterior choroidal artery to the aneurysm, and completeness of aneurysm occlusion on follow-up angiograms were also analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine aneurysms requiring placement of at least 1 Pipeline Embolization Device (median = 1, range = 1-3) across the anterior choroidal artery ostium were identified. At angiographic follow-up (mean = 15.1 months; range = 12-39 months), the anterior choroidal artery remained patent, with antegrade flow in 28/29 aneurysms (96.5%), while 24/29 (82.7%) of the target aneurysms were angiographically occluded by 1-year follow-up angiography. Anterior choroidal artery occlusion, with retrograde reconstitution of the vessel, was noted in a single case. A significant correlation between the origin of the anterior choroidal artery from the aneurysm dome and failure of the aneurysms to occlude following treatment was found. CONCLUSIONS: After placement of 36 Pipeline Embolization Devices across 29 anterior choroidal arteries (median = 1 device, range = 1-3 devices), 1 of 29 anterior choroidal arteries was found occluded on angiographic follow-up. The vessel occlusion did not result in persistent clinical sequelae.

26,26,"BACKGROUNDThe hemodynamic force of wall shear stress (WSS) has demonstrated a critical role in atherogenesis. PURPOSETo study the effect of age and gender on mean WSS (MWSS) values in major cerebral arteries. METHODThirteen cerebral arterial location sites in 301 healthy (157 M, 144 F; mean 4715 years; range 18-84 years old) were studied. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography was used to obtain volume flow and diameter, and subsequently to calculate MWSS via the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. RESULTSMWSS decreased significantly with age in all vessels, declining from 9.5 to 5.7 dynes/cm(2) in the neck vessels and from 22.9 to 16.2 dynes/cm(2) in the intracranial vessels. MWSS is significantly higher in females than in males in all six neck vessels. The most significant drop in MWSS occurred between the age groups 48-57 and 58-67 (P < .05 for 12 vessels). CONCLUSIONThe overall decline in MWSS observed with age may be due to a decrease in flow. However, the marked drop in MWSS between the 48-57 and 58-67 age groups corresponded with an increase in diameter and systolic blood pressure rather than a significant drop in flow.",Wall Shear Stress in Major Cerebral Arteries as a Function of Age and Gender-A Study of 301 Healthy Volunteers,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2015,25039410,['Angiography'],2.618453865,Angiography,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.618453865,"['wall shear stress', 'cerebral arteries', 'blood-flow', 'common carotid-artery', 'in-vivo', 'magnetic resonance angiography', 'phase-contrast']",WSS
27,27,"In this preliminary study, 7T imaging was capable of identifying not only intracranial wall thickening but different plaque components such as foamy macrophages and collagen. Signal heterogeneity was typical of advanced atherosclerotic disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several studies have attempted to characterize intracranial atherosclerotic plaques by using MR imaging sequences. However, dedicated validation of these sequences with histology has not yet been performed. The current study assessed the ability of ultra-high-resolution 7T MR imaging sequences with different image contrast weightings to image plaque components, by using histology as criterion standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five specimens of the circle of Wills were imaged at 7T with 0.11 x 0.11 mm in-plane-resolution proton attenuation-, T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted sequences (through-plane resolution, 0.11-1 mm). Tissue samples from 13 fiducial-marked locations (per specimen) on MR imaging underwent histologic processing and atherosclerotic plaque classification. Reconstructed MR images were matched with histologic sections at corresponding locations. RESULTS: Forty-four samples were available for subsequent evaluation of agreement or disagreement between plaque components and image contrast differences. Of samples, 52.3% (n = 23) showed no image contrast heterogeneity; this group comprised solely no lesions or early lesions. Of samples, 25.0% (n = 11, mostly advanced lesions) showed good correlation between the spatial organization of MR imaging heterogeneities and plaque components. Areas of foamy macrophages were generally seen as proton attenuation-, T2-, and T2*- hypointense areas, while areas of increased collagen content showed more ambiguous signal intensities.

28,28,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-diverter technology has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for intracranial aneurysm based on the concept of flow diversion allowing parent artery and collateral preservation and aneurysm healing. We investigated the patency of covered side branches and flow modification within the parent artery following placement of the Pipeline Embolization Device in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six aneurysms in 59 patients were treated with 96 Pipeline Embolization Devices. We retrospectively reviewed imaging and clinical results during the postoperative period at 6 and 12 months to assess flow modification through the parent artery and side branches. Reperfusion syndrome was assessed by MR imaging and clinical evaluation. RESULTS: Slow flow was observed in 13 of 68 (19.1%) side branches covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device. It was reported in all cases of anterior cerebral artery coverage, in 3/5 cases of M2-MCA coverage, and in 5/34 (14.7%) cases of ophthalmic artery coverage. One territorial infarction was observed in a case of M2-MCA coverage, without arterial occlusion. One case of deep Sylvian infarct was reported in a case of coverage of MCA perforators. Two ophthalmic arteries (5.9%) were occluded, and 11 side branches (16.2%) were narrowed at 12 months' follow-up; patients remained asymptomatic. Parent vessel flow modification was responsible for 2 cases (3.4%) of reperfusion syndrome. Overall permanent morbidity and mortality rates were 5.2% and 6.9%, respectively. We did not report any permanent deficit or death in case of slow flow observed within side branches. CONCLUSIONS: After Pipeline Embolization Device placement, reperfusion syndrome was observed in 3.4%, and territorial infarction, in 3.4%. Delayed occlusion of ophthalmic arteries and delayed narrowing of arteries covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device were observed in 5.9% and 16.2%, respectively.

Our primary focus was methodological to explore the effect of segmentation corrections on the clinical relevance of the output metrics. METHODSThree-dimensional T1-weighted images were acquired to compare 61 MS patients to 30 age- and gender-matched normal controls (NC). We also tested the within patient MRI relationship to disability (eg, expanded disability status scale [EDSS] score) and cognition. Statistical parametric mapping v. 8 (SPM8)-derived gray matter (GMF), white matter (WMF), and total brain parenchyma fractions (BPF) were derived before and after correcting errors from T1 hypointense MS lesions and/or ineffective deep GM contouring. RESULTSMS patients had lower GMF and BPF as compared to NC (P<.05). Cognitively impaired patients had lower BPF than cognitively preserved patients (P<.05). BPF was related to EDSS; BPF and GMF were related to disease duration (all P<.05). Errors caused bias in GMFs and WMFs but had no discernable influence on BPFs or any MRI-clinical associations.

31,31,"BACKGROUNDPosterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a rare neurodegenerative syndrome with visuospatial deficits. PET studies have identified hypometabolism of the occipital cortex in PCA. There is, however, a huge overlap in clinical presentation and involvement of the occipital cortex between PCA, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Syndrome-specific patterns of metabolism have not yet been demonstrated that allow for a reliable differentiation with [F-18]-FDG-PET. METHODSA total of 33 dementia patients (PCA n = 6, DLB n = 12, AD n = 15) who underwent [F-18]-FDG-PET imaging and a neuropsychological examination were retrospectively analyzed. Group comparisons of regional cerebral glucose metabolism were calculated with statistical parametric mapping. Extracted clusters were used to evaluate discrimination accuracy by logistic regression. RESULTSPCA patients showed a syndrome-specific area of hypometabolism in the right lateral temporooccipital cortex. DLB patients showed specific hypometabolism predominantly in the left occipital cortex. Logistic regression based on these two regions correctly separated patients with a sensitivity/specificity of 83/93% for PCA, 75/86% for DLB and 67/78% for AD. Overall accuracy was 73%.

We found a statistically significant decrement of FA values in PD patients compared to controls (p < 0.05). In addition, extrapolating and analyzing FA XYZ direction samplings for each patient and each control, we found that this result was due to a stronger decrement of FA values along the Y axis (antero-posterior direction) (p < 0.01); FA changes along X and Z axes were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). We confirmed also no statistically significant differences of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for cerebellar peduncles in PD patients compared to healthy controls.

In addition, extrapolating and analyzing FA XYZ direction samplings for each patient and each control, we found that this result was due to a stronger decrement of FA values along the Y axis (antero-posterior direction) (p < 0.01); FA changes along X and Z axes were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). We confirmed also no statistically significant differences of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for cerebellar peduncles in PD patients compared to healthy controls. The DTI-based cerebellar abnormalities in PD could constitute an advance in the knowledge of this disease. We demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of FA in cerebellar hemispheres of PD patients compared to healthy controls. Our work also demonstrated that the use of more sophisticated approaches in the DTI parameter analysis could potentially have a clinical relevance.",Diffusion tensor imaging parameters' changes of cerebellar hemispheres in Parkinson's disease,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,25479963,"['DTI', 'MRI']",2.164948454,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.164948454,"['spherical deconvolution', 'probabilistic tractography', 'mri', 'progressive supranuclear palsy', 'diffusion tensor imaging', 'white matter', ""parkinson's""]",parkinson
33,33,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship between reperfusion and clinical outcome is time-dependent, and the effect of reperfusion on outcome can vary on the basis of the extent of collateral flow. We aimed to identify the impact of time-to-reperfusion on outcome relative to baseline angiographic collateral grade in patients successfully treated with endovascular revascularization for acute large-vessel anterior circulation stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred seven patients were selected for analysis from our prospectively maintained registry. Inclusion criteria were M1 MCA +/- ICA occlusions, onset-to-puncture time within 8 hours, and successful endovascular reperfusion. Baseline angiographic collateral grades were independently evaluated and dichotomized into poor (0-1) versus good (2-4). Multivariable analyses were performed to identify the effect of collateral-flow adequacy on favorable outcome on the basis of onset-to-reperfusion time and puncture-to-reperfusion time. RESULTS: In the poor collateral group, the odds of favorable outcome significantly dropped for patients with onset-to-reperfusion time of >300 minutes or puncture-to-reperfus ion time of >60 minutes (onset-to-puncture time: <= 300, 59% versus >300, 32%; OR, 0.24; P =.011; puncture-to-reperfusion time: m.60, 73% versus >60,32%: OR, 0.21,P = .011), whereas the probability of favorable outcome in the good collateral group was not significantly influenced by onset-to-reperfusion time or punctur e-to-reperfusion time. In the subgroup lesion-volume growth analysis by using DWI, the effect of puncture-to-reperfusion time of >60 minutes was significantly greater compared with the effect of puncture-to-reperfusion time of <.60 minutes in the poor collateral group (beta = 41.6 cm(3), P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Time-to-reperfusion including onset-to-reperfusion time and puncture-to-reperfusion time in patients with poor collaterals is an important limiting factor for favorable outcome in a time-dependent fashion. Future trials may benefit from a noninvasive imaging technique to detect poor collaterals along with a strategy for rapid reperfusion.",Impact of Time-to-Reperfusion on Outcome in Patients with Poor Collaterals,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,25376808,['DTI'],2.123893805,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.123893805,"['thrombolytic therapy', 'acute ischemic-stroke', 'successful']",stroke
34,34,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rupture risk assessment for intracranial aneurysms remains challenging, and risk factors, including wall shear stress, are discussed controversially. The primary purpose of the presented challenge was to determine how consistently aneurysm rupture status and rupture site could be identified on the basis of computational fluid dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two geometrically similar MCA aneurysms were selected, 1 ruptured, 1 unruptured. Participating computational fluid dynamics groups were blinded as to which case was ruptured. Participants were provided with digitally segmented lumen geometries and, for this phase of the challenge, were free to choose their own flow rates, blood rheologies, and so forth. Participants were asked to report which case had ruptured and the likely site of rupture. In parallel, lumen geometries were provided to a group of neurosurgeons for their predictions of rupture status and site. RESULTS: Of 26 participating computational fluid dynamics groups, 21 (81%) correctly identified the ruptured case. Although the known rupture site was associated with low and oscillatory wall shear stress, most groups identified other sites, some of which also experienced low and oscillatory shear. Of the 43 participating neurosurgeons, 39 (91%) identified the ruptured case. None correctly identified the rupture site. CONCLUSIONS: Geometric or hemodynamic considerations favor identification of rupture status; however, retrospective identification of the rupture site remains a challenge for both engineers and clinicians. A more precise understanding of the hemodynamic factors involved in aneurysm wall pathology is likely required for computational fluid dynamics to add value to current clinical decision-making regarding rupture risk.",The Computational Fluid Dynamics Rupture Challenge 2013-Phase I: Prediction of Rupture Status in Intracranial Aneurysms,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,25500315,['angiography'],2.123893805,angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.123893805,"['hemodynamics', 'subarachnoid hemorrhage', 'cerebral aneurysms', 'association']",aneurysms
35,35,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Silk flow-diverter stent is increasingly used to treat complex intracranial aneurysms including wide-neck, fusiform aneurysms. Sparse data are available concerning long-term results of this technique. We report our 5-year experience with Silk stent treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified all patients treated by the Silk stent in 2 institutions. Clinical charts, procedural data, and angiographic results were reviewed. RESULTS: Between July 2009 and May 2014, we identified 58 patients with 70 intracranial aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was successful in 93% of patients with 32 treated with the first-generation Silk stent and 26 with the new Silk+ stent. Mean follow-up in 47 patients was 22 months. Despite an 11% delayed complication rate, overall permanent neurologic morbidity was 5.5%. All complications were seen with the first-generation Silk stent. There was no procedure-related mortality. Long-term anatomic results showed 73% with complete occlusion, 16% with neck remnants, and 11% with incomplete occlusion. No recanalization or retreatment was performed. The midterm intrastent stenosis rate was 57%, of which 60% improved or disappeared, 28% were stable, and 12% led to vessel occlusion. Seventy-four percent of stenosis and all vessel occlusions occurred with the first-generation Silk stent. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms with the Silk stent is an effective therapeutic option. Despite a high rate of delayed complications with the first-generation stents, the current Silk+ stent appears safer.

36,36,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Standard neuroimaging fails in defining the anatomy of the substantia nigra and has a marginal role in the diagnosis of Parkinson disease. Recently 7T MR target imaging of the substantia nigra has been useful in diagnosing Parkinson disease. We performed a comparative study to evaluate whether susceptibility-weighted angiography can diagnose Parkinson disease with a 3T scanner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with Parkinson disease and 13 healthy subjects underwent MR imaging examination at 3T and 7T by using susceptibility-weighted angiography. Two expert blinded observers and 1 neuroradiology fellow evaluated the 3T and 7T images of the sample to identify substantia nigra abnormalities indicative of Parkinson disease. Diagnostic accuracy and intra-and interobserver agreement were calculated separately for 3T and 7T acquisitions. RESULTS: Susceptibility-weighted angiography 7T MR imaging can diagnose Parkinson disease with a mean sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 100%, and diagnostic accuracy of 96%. 3T MR imaging diagnosed Parkinson disease with a mean sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 94%, and diagnostic accuracy of 86%. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was excellent at 7T. At 3T, intraobserver agreement was excellent for experts, and interobserver agreement ranged between good and excellent. The less expert reader obtained a diagnostic accuracy of 89% at 3T. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility-weighted angiography images obtained at 3T and 7T differentiate controls from patients with Parkinson disease with a higher diagnostic accuracy at 7T. The capability of 3T in diagnosing Parkinson disease might encourage its use in clinical practice. The use of the more accurate 7T should be supported by a dedicated cost-effectiveness study.",Comparison of 3T and 7T Susceptibility-Weighted Angiography of the Substantia Nigra in Diagnosing Parkinson Disease,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,25376811,['Angiography'],2.595870206,Angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.595870206,"['imaging swi', 'pd pathoanatomical correlation', 'clinical-diagnosis']",parkinson

METHODSWe reviewed brain MR reports to identify all DVAs reported on studies performed between 2009 and 2012. DVA location and findings on PWI and/or ASL imaging were assessed by visual inspection. Sizes of DVAs were categorized as small (<15 mm), medium (15-25 mm), and large (>25 mm). For ASL, signal in the DVA, surrounding parenchyma, or associated draining vein was recorded. For PWI, changes on hemodynamic maps (cerebral blood volume [CBV], cerebral blood flow [CBF], mean transit time [MTT], and normalized time-to-peak of the residue function [Tmax]) were evaluated. Coexisting vascular malformations in association with DVAs were also identified. RESULTSSix hundred and fifty-two DVAs were identified in 632 subjects.

38,38,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEHypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is an uncommon type of transneuronal degeneration. Case reports and case series described in the literature provide a foundation of our current knowledge of HOD. These reports have described HOD most frequently to be unilateral and occurring in association with lesions in the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway. Our purpose was to evaluate the rate of bilateral versus unilateral HOD in a large case series. METHODSA retrospective review was performed to identify patients in which the phrase hypertrophic olivary degeneration occurred in the radiology report. A diagnosis of HOD was confirmed on imaging if there was focal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images confined to either or both inferior olivary nuclei. RESULTSA total of 102 patients had findings consistent with HOD. Of these, 76% had findings bilaterally. In 44%, a lesion could not be identified to explain HOD. Bilateral HOD was common in both lesional and nonlesional group, though more common in the nonlesional group. CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates that HOD is frequently bilateral. In slightly over 50% of patients with HOD, a lesion can be identified.

The arterial tortuosity was evaluated and, when present, was categorized as elongation, kinking, or coiling. For each patient, both the right and left sides were considered for a total number of 248 arteries in order to have the same number of cases and controls. Fisher's exact test was applied to test the association between elongation, kinking, coiling, dissection, and the side affected by CAD. Fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant association between the ICAD and kinking (p = 0.0089) and coiling (p = 0.0251) whereas no statistically significant difference was found with arterial vessel elongation (p = 0.444).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 7 healthy subjects, with EPI and TSE sequences, on 5 MR imaging systems at 3 time points in 2 institutions. ADC maps of EPI (with 2 b-values and 6 b-values) and TSE sequences were compared. Mean ADC values for different tissues (submandibular gland, sternocleidomastoid muscle, spinal cord, subdigastric lymph node, and tonsil) were used to evaluate intra- and intersubject, intersystem, and intersequence variability by using a linear mixed model.

41,41,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Polymicrogyria is a malformation of cortical development that is often identified in children with epilepsy or delayed development. We investigated in vivo the potential of 7T imaging in characterizing polymicrogyria to determine whether additional features could be identified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten adult patients with polymicrogyria previously diagnosed by using 3T MR imaging underwent additional imaging at 7T. We assessed polymicrogyria according to topographic pattern, extent, symmetry, and morphology. Additional imaging sequences at 7T included 3D T2* susceptibility-weighted angiography and 2D tissue border enhancement FSE inversion recovery. Minimum intensity projections were used to assess the potential of the susceptibility-weighted angiography sequence for depiction of cerebral veins. RESULTS: At 7T, we observed perisylvian polymicrogyria that was bilateral in 6 patients, unilateral in 3, and diffuse in 1. Four of the 6 bilateral abnormalities had been considered unilateral at 3T. While 3T imaging revealed 2 morphologic categories (coarse, delicate), 7T susceptibility-weighted angiography images disclosed a uniform ribbonlike pattern. Susceptibility-weighted angiography revealed numerous dilated superficial veins in all polymicrogyric areas. Tissue border enhancement imaging depicted a hypointense line corresponding to the gray-white interface, providing a high definition of the borders and, thereby, improving detection of the polymicrogyric cortex.

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of dual stent placement by using a low-profile stent system (LEO Baby) for the treatment of challenging distal intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients in whom at least 1 LEO Baby stent was used in the context of dual stent placement for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Patients who were treated with dual stent-assisted coil embolization and telescopic implantation of LEO Baby stents were included in the study. Clinical and angiographic findings, procedural data, and follow-up are reported. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included in this study. Three patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage in the subacute-chronic phase, and the remaining patients had unruptured aneurysms. Nine patients were treated by using the dual stent-assisted coiling method. X- (nonintersecting), Y- (intersecting and reversible), T-, and parallel-stent configurations were performed for the dual stent-assisted coiling procedures. Three patients were treated by using telescopic stent placement for a flow diverter like effect. The procedures were successful in all cases. Technical complications without a significant clinical adverse event developed in 2 patients. The 3- and 6-month control MRAs and DSAs demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysms in all patients except 1. All patients had good clinical outcomes on follow-up (mRS <= 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2009 to April 2013, the clinical and angiographic outcomes of all 28 patients treated for aneurysms with flow-diverting stents covering the origin of the ophthalmic artery were prospectively collected. The origin of the ophthalmic artery in relation to the target aneurysm was classified by using a 4-type classification. A complete ophthalmic examination was performed by a single ophthalmologist 48 hours before and 1 week after covering the ophthalmic artery. RESULTS: Ophthalmic artery patency was normal at the end of endovascular treatment in 24/28 cases (85.7%). With extensive ophthalmic examinations, 11 patients (39.3%) showed new ophthalmic complications. Patients with the ophthalmic artery originating from the aneurysm sac were at high risk for retinal emboli (4/5, 80%). Patients with the ophthalmic artery originating from the inner curve of the carotid siphon were at high risk for optic nerve ischemic atrophy (3/4, 75%). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study shows that covering the ophthalmic artery with a flow-diverting stent is not without potential complications. Ophthalmic complications can occur but are often not diagnosed. The anatomic disposition of the ophthalmic artery in relation to the carotid siphon and aneurysm should be clearly understood because some configurations have a higher risk. When not required, covering of the ophthalmic artery by flow-diverting stents should be avoided.",Visual Outcomes with Flow-Diverter Stents Covering the Ophthalmic Artery for Treatment of Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysms,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2015,25339649,['CT'],1.887905605,CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.887905605,"['intracranial aneurysms', 'endovascular', 'pipeline embolization device']",aneurysms
45,45,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). If mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event contributing to PD development, then noninvasive techniques that detect disturbed energy metabolism in vivo might be useful tools for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that proton (H-1) and phosphorus (P-31) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures of brain metabolites are able to differentiate between individuals with early PD and healthy volunteers (HVs). METHODS During this cross-sectional study including 20 subjects with early PD and 15 age-matched HV, ventricular lactate (anaerobic glycolysis); and regional levels of N-acetylaspartate (neuronal integrity); choline (membrane turnover); creatine (energy metabolism); ATP and other phosphate-containing compounds (oxidative phosphorylation) were determined using brain H-1 and P-31 MRS. RESULTS No metabolic abnormalities were detectable in early-stage PD patients. Metabolite concentrations were not related to age, disease duration, or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores. DISCUSSION In early PD, neither H-1 nor P-31 MRS were able to detect metabolic abnormalities, a finding that is in contrast to published data in more advanced PD cohorts.

47,47,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Head and neck cancer is common, and understanding the prognosis is an important part of patient management. In addition to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis staging system, tumor biomarkers are becoming more useful in understanding prognosis and directing treatment. We assessed whether MR imaging texture analysis would correctly classify oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma according to p53 status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 16 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma was prospectively evaluated by using standard clinical, histopathologic, and imaging techniques. Tumors were stained for p53 and scored by an anatomic pathologist. Regions of interest on MR imaging were selected by a neuroradiologist and then analyzed by using our 2D fast time-frequency transform tool. The quantified textures were assessed by using the subset-size forward-selection algorithm in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. Features found to be significant were used to create a statistical model to predict p53 status. The model was tested by using a Bayesian network classifier with 10-fold stratified cross-validation. RESULTS: Feature selection identified 7 significant texture variables that were used in a predictive model. The resulting model predicted p53 status with 81.3% accuracy (P < .05). Cross-validation showed a moderate level of agreement (kappa = 0.625). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that MR imaging texture analysis correctly predicts p53 status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with similar to 80% accuracy.

48,48,"BACKGROUND Previous studies have demonstrated that cerebral dural sinus stenosis (DSS) may be a potential patho-physiological cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Endovascular therapy for DSS is emerging as a potential alternative to treat IIH. Here, we present the results of our case series. METHOD We prospectively collected angiographic and manometric data on patients that underwent angioplasty/stenting for IIH. All patients had failed maximal medical therapy (MMT) and had confirmed sinus stenosis. Demographic, clinical and radiological presentation, and outcomes were collected retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 18 patients underwent 25 procedures. Demographics revealed a mean age of 30 (range 15-59), 83% (15/18) were female, 72% (13/18) were white, and mean body mass index of 36 (range 23-59.2). All patients presented with classic IIH. Symptom improvement or resolution was reported in 94% (17/18) of patients. All patients had resolution and/or stabilization/improvement of their papilledema. Headaches related to increased pressure improved in 56% (10/18). Re-stenosis and retreatment occurred in 33% (6/18). No procedural related complications were reported. CONCLUSION Dural sinus angioplasty and stenting is relatively safe, feasible, and clinically efficacious for patients with symptomatic sinus stenosis who have failed standard therapy.

49,49,"Treatment with the humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab in glioblastoma patients suppresses contrast enhancement via the reduction of vascular permeability, which does not necessarily indicate real reduction of tumor cell mass. Therefore, other imaging criteria are needed to recognize tumor growth under bevacizumab more reliably. It is still unknown, whether quantitative T1 mapping is useful to monitor the effects of anti-angiogenic therapy or to indicate a tumor progression earlier and more reliable compared to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. This raised the question whether quantitative T1 mapping is more suitable to monitor treatment effects of bevacizumab. Conventional and quantitative MRI was performed on six consecutive patients with recurrent glioblastoma before treatment with bevacizumab and every 8 weeks thereafter until further tumor progression. Quantitative T1 maps before and after intravenous application of contrast agent and quantitative T2 maps were performed to calculate serial differential maps and subtraction maps from one time point, subtracting contrast-enhanced T1 maps from non-contrast T1 maps. In five illustrative cases, tumor progression was documented earlier in differential T1 relaxation time (DiffT1) and T2 relaxation time (DiffT2) maps before changes in the conventional MRI studies were obvious. Four patients showed previous prolongation of T1 relaxation time in the DiffT1 maps, suggesting tumor progression, and subtraction maps revealed faint contrast enhancement matching with the areas of T1 prolongation. Our results emphasize that quantitative relaxation time mapping could be a promising method for tumor monitoring in glioblastoma patients under anti-angiogenic therapy.

The hybrid imaging technology F-18-FDG-PET/MR imaging combining morphological and functional information might be attractive in this patient population. The aim of the study was to compare whole-body F-18-FDG-PET/MR imaging and F-18-FDG-PET/CT in patients with head and neck cancer, both qualitatively in terms of lymph node and distant metastases detection and quantitatively in terms of standardized uptake values measured in F-18-FDG-avid lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with head and neck cancer underwent both whole-body PET/CT and PET/MR imaging after a single injection of F-18-FDG. Two groups of readers counted the number of lesions on PET/CT and PET/MR imaging scans. A consensus reading was performed in those cases in which the groups disagreed.

54,54,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative embolization for intracranial meningiomas offers potential advantages for safer and more effective surgery. However, this treatment strategy has not been examined in a large comparative series. The purpose of this study was to review our experience using preoperative embolization to understand the efficacy, technical considerations and complications of this technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing intracranial meningionna resection at our institution (March 2001 to December 2012). Comparisons were made between ennbolized and nonernbolized patients, including patient and tumor characteristics, embolization method, operative blood loss, complications, and extent of resection. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors predictive of operative blood loss and extent of resection. RESULTS: Preoperatively, 224 patients were referred for embolization, of which 177 received embolization. No complications were seen in 97.1%. There were no significant differences in operative duration, extent of resection, or complications. Estimated blood loss was higher in the embolized group (410 versus 315 mL, P =.0074), but history of embolization was not a predictor of blood loss in multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of blood loss included decreasing degree of tumor embolization (P =.037), skull base location (P =.005), and male sex (P =.034). Embolization was not an independent predictor of gross total resection. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ennbolization is a safe option for selected nneningionnas. In our series embolization did not alter the operative duration, complications, or degree of resection, but the degree of embolization was an independent predictor of decreased operative blood loss.","Preoperative Embolization of Intracranial Meningiomas: Efficacy, Technical Considerations, and Complications",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2014,24722303,['angiography'],2.5,angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.5,"['internal carotid-artery', 'particle', 'therapeutic embolization']",embolization
55,55,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE An effort to define and validate a Harmonized Protocol for standard hippocampal segmentation is being carried out. We wished to estimate the effect of magnetic resonance image (MRI) spatial orientation on manual hippocampal segmentations to define optimal standard orientation of MRIs for hippocampal volumetry. METHODS Three expert tracers segmented twice the hippocampi of 10 ADNI subjects on MRI slices oriented perpendicular to the anterior-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line and the long hippocampal axes plane, following internationally harmonized landmarks. We computed intra and interrater reliability figures for total volumes and similarity coefficients. RESULTS Total volume reliability was similar for both orientations. Similarity coefficients were significantly higher for the AC-PC orientation (exact P = 0.002). DISCUSSION These data show that AC-PC orientation is slightly more reliable for manual segmentations, possibly due to better visualization of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces separating hippocampal head and amygdala.

56,56,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Attempts have been made to associate intracranial aneurysmal hemodynamics with aneurysm growth and rupture status. Hemodynamics in aneurysms is traditionally determined with computational fluid dynamics by using generalized inflow boundary conditions in a parent artery. Recently, patient-specific inflow boundary conditions are being implemented more frequently. Our purpose was to compare intracranial aneurysm hemodynamics based on generalized versus patient-specific inflow boundary conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 36 patients, geometric models of aneurysms were determined by using 3D rotational angiography. 2D phase-contrast MR imaging velocity measurements of the parent artery were performed. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed twice: once by using patient-specific phase-contrast MR imaging velocity profiles and once by using generalized Womersley profiles as inflow boundary conditions. Resulting mean and maximum wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index values were analyzed, and hemodynamic characteristics were qualitatively compared. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis showed statistically significant differences for mean and maximum wall shear stress values between both inflow boundary conditions (P<.001). Qualitative assessment of hemodynamic characteristics showed differences in 21 cases: high wall shear stress location (n = 8), deflection location (n = 3), lobulation wall shear stress (n = 12), and/or vortex and inflow jet stability (n = 9). The latter showed more instability for the generalized inflow boundary conditions in 7 of 9 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Using generalized and patient-specific inflow boundary conditions for computational fluid dynamics results in different wall shear stress magnitudes and hemodynamic characteristics. Generalized inflow boundary conditions result in more vortices and inflow jet instabilities. This study emphasizes the necessity of patient-specific inflow boundary conditions for calculation of hemodynamics in cerebral aneurysms by using computational fluid dynamics techniques.",Generalized versus Patient-Specific Inflow Boundary Conditions in Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations of Cerebral Aneurysmal Hemodynamics,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2014,24651816,['Angiography'],2.1,Angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.1,"['intracranial aneurysms', 'coil embolization', 'artery', 'wall shear-stress']",aneurysms

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging derived vascular permeability parameters, including the volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant between the extravascular extracellular space and plasma, for the differentiation of primary CNS lymphoma and glioblastoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty glioblastomas and 11 primary central nervous system lymphomas were included. Pretreatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging with a 3D T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo sequence was performed on a 3T MR imaging scanner. Perfusion parameters (volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant) were measured on the basis of the Tofts-Kernmode model. The Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to compare those parameters between primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma.

RESULTS: Median volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values were significantly higher in primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.145 +/- 0.057 and 0.396 +/- 0.088) than in glioblastoma (0.064 +/- 0.021 and 0.230 +/- 0.058) (P < .001, respectively).

This information is essential for assessment of clinical benefit derived from recanalization therapies. METHODS Patients with AIS due to anterior circulation large artery occlusion not treated with reperfusion therapies admitted from January 2005 to September 2010 were consecutively selected. Site of occlusion was assessed with transcranial duplex according to Thrombolysis in Brain Infarction (TIBI) grades. Poor outcome was considered as a modified Rankin Scale>2 at 90 days. RESULTS A total of 120 patients were studied. Site of occlusion was terminal internal carotid artery (TICA) in 13 (10.8%), proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 69 (57.5%), and distal MCA in 38 (31.7%) patients. Overall, 74.2% of patients had poor outcome. There were significant differences in poor outcome between patients with TICA, proximal MCA, and distal MCA occlusion (92%, 87%, 47%, P < .001) and mortality at 90 days (23%, 12%, 3%, P = .001).

METHODS Nineteen patients with surgically proven iNPH and 24 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 14 healthy elderlies were examined. Regions of interest (ROIs) in the ventricular/sylvian (VS) and high convexity/midline (HCM) areas were used in VBM, and differences in CSF volume within these ROIs among the 4 groups were examined. RESULTS The relative CSF volume in the VS-ROI in the iNPH group (.64) was significantly higher than that in the AD, PD, and healthy control groups (.26, .29, and .17, respectively; P < .001), whereas the relative CSF volume in the HCM-ROI was significantly reduced in the iNPH (.10) than in the other (.17, .16, and .16, respectively) groups (P < .001). Furthermore, the ratio of the 2 areas (VS/HCM) was markedly higher in the iNPH (6.87) than in the other (1.65, 1.74, .97, respectively) groups (P < .001), with sensitivity and specificity of .89 and 1.00, respectively.

Semiquantitative perfusion parameters (cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, mean transit time, and time to peak) were calculated from time-density curves obtained from intraarterial contrast injection. The effects of intraarterial vasospasm therapy were assessed. RESULTS Eight vascular territories in 4 patients with vasospasm underwent interventional angiography and angiographic perfusion analysis. Pretreatment perfusion maps demonstrated variable perfusion deficits in specific vascular territories. After endovascular treatment in 6 vessels, improvement was seen to varying degrees in both angiographic appearance and perfusion parameters.

Semiquantitative perfusion parameters (cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, mean transit time, and time to peak) were calculated from time-density curves obtained from intraarterial contrast injection. The effects of intraarterial vasospasm therapy were assessed. RESULTS Eight vascular territories in 4 patients with vasospasm underwent interventional angiography and angiographic perfusion analysis. Pretreatment perfusion maps demonstrated variable perfusion deficits in specific vascular territories. After endovascular treatment in 6 vessels, improvement was seen to varying degrees in both angiographic appearance and perfusion parameters. Clinical improvement and reduction in transcranial Doppler velocity was also observed. CONCLUSIONS Real-time angiographic perfusion imaging is feasible during endovascular procedures for vasospasm. Perfusion analysis may aid in assessment of efficacy of the intervention. Comparison with traditional perfusion imaging is needed to validate this technique.",Angiographic Perfusion Imaging: Real-Time Assessment of Endovascular Treatment for Cerebral Vasospasm,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2014,24015728,"['Angiography', 'MRP']",2.541296061,MRP,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.541296061,"['aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage', 'acute ischemic-stroke', 'cerebral angiography', 'ct perfusion', 'perfusion imaging', 'intracranial vasospasm']",stroke
62,62,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The multiparametric imaging can show us different aspects of tumor behavior and may help differentiation of tumor recurrence from treatment related change. Our aim was to differentiate tumor progression from pseudoprogression in patients with glioblastoma by using multiparametric histogram analysis of 2 consecutive MR imaging studies with relative cerebral blood volume and ADC values. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients with glioblastoma with new or increased size of enhancing lesions after concomitant chemoradiation therapy following surgical resection were included. Combined histograms were made by using the relative cerebral blood volume and ADC values of enhancing areas for initial and follow-up MR imaging, and subtracted histograms were also prepared. The histogram parameters between groups were compared. The diagnostic accuracy of tumor progression based on the histogram parameters of initial and follow-up MR imaging and subtracted histograms was compared and correlated with overall survival. RESULTS: Twenty-four pseudoprogressions and 11 tumor progressions were determined. Diagnosis based on the subtracted histogram mode with a multiparametric approach was more accurate than the diagnosis based on the uniparametric approach (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.877 versus 0.801), with 81.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity. A high mode of relative cerebral blood volume on the subtracted histogram by using a multiparametric approach (relative cerebral blood volume X ADC) was the best predictor of true tumor progression (P < .001) and worse survival (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Multiparametric histogram analysis of posttreatment glioblastoma was useful to predict true tumor progression and worse survival.",Differentiation of Tumor Progression from Pseudoprogression in Patients with Posttreatment Glioblastoma Using Multiparametric Histogram Analysis,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2014,24676005,['MRI'],2.17,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.17,"['glioma', 'temozolomide', 'grade', 'blood-volume maps', 'radiation necrosis']",tumor
63,63,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endo lymphatic hydrops has been recognized as the underlying pathophysiology of Meniere disease. We used 3T MR imaging to detect and grade endolymphatic hydrops in patients with Meniere disease and to correlate MR imaging findings with the clinical severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR images of the inner ear acquired by a 3D inversion recovery sequence 4 hours after intravenous contrast administration were retrospectively analyzed by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to the clinical presentation. Endo lymphatic hydrops was classified as none, grade I, or grade II. Interobserver agreement was analyzed, and the presence of endolymphatic hydrops was correlated with the clinical diagnosis and the clinical Meniere disease score. RESULTS: Of 53 patients, we identified endolymphatic hydrops in 90% on the clinically affected and in 22% on the clinically silent side. Interobserver agreement on detection and grading of endolymphatic hydrops was 0.97 for cochlear and 0.94 for vestibular hydrops. The average MR imaging grade of endolymphatic hydrops was 1.27 +/- 0.66 for 55 clinically affected and 0.65 +/- 0.58 for 10 clinically normal ears. The correlation between the presence of endolymphatic hydrops and Meniere disease was 0.67. Endolymphatic hydrops was detected in 73% of ears with the clinical diagnosis of possible, 100% of probable, and 95% of definite Meniere disease. CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging supports endolymphatic hydrops as a pathophysiologic hallmark of Meniere disease. High interobserver agreement on the detection and grading of endolymphatic hydrops and the correlation of MR imaging findings with the clinical score recommend MR imaging as a reliable in vivo technique in patients with Meniere disease.

Our aim was to determine whether clinical and angioarchitectural features of brain AVMs differ between children and adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospectively collected institutional data base of all patients diagnosed with brain AVMs since 2001 was queried. Demographic, clinical, and angioarchitecture information was summarized and analyzed with univariable and multivariable models. RESULTS: Results often differed when age was treated as a continuous variable as opposed to dividing subjects into children (18 years or younger; n = 203) versus adults (older than 18 years; n = 630).

65,65,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The usefulness of pharmacokinetic parameters for glioma grading has been reported based on the perfusion data from parts of entire-tumor volumes. However, the perfusion values may not reflect the entire-tumor characteristics. Our aim was to investigate the feasibility of glioma grading by using histogram analyses of pharmacokinetic parameters including the volume transfer constant, extravascular extracellular space volume per unit volume of tissue, and blood plasma volume per unit volume of tissue from T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (14 men, 14 women; mean age, 49.75 years; age range, 25-72 years) with histopathologically confirmed gliomas (World Health Organization grade II, n = 7; grade III, n = 8; grade IV, n = 13) were examined before surgery or biopsy with conventional MR imaging and T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging at 3T. Volume transfer constant, extravascular extracellular space volume per unit volume of tissue, and blood plasma volume per unit volume of tissue were calculated from the entire-tumor volume. Histogram analyses from these parameters were correlated with glioma grades. The parameters with the best percentile from cumulative histograms were identified by analysis of the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic analysis and were compared by using multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis for distinguishing high- from low-grade gliomas. RESULTS: All parametric values increased with increasing glioma grade. There were significant differences among the 3 grades in all parameters (P < .01). For the differentiation of high- and low-grade gliomas, the highest area under the curve values were found at the 98th percentile of the volume transfer constant (area under the curve, 0.912; cutoff value, 0.277), the 90th percentile of extravascular extracellular space volume per unit volume of tissue (area under the curve, 0.939; cutoff value, 19.70), and the 84th percentile of blood plasma volume per unit volume of tissue (area under the curve, 0.769; cutoff value, 11.71). The 98th percentile volume transfer constant value was the only variable that could be used to independently differentiate high- and low-grade gliomas in multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Histogram analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters from whole-tumor volume data can be a useful method for glioma grading.

66,66,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging-guided focused sonography surgery is a new stereotactic technique that uses high-intensity focused sonography to heat and ablate tissue. The goal of this study was to describe MR imaging findings pre- and post-ventralis intermedius nucleus lesioning by MR imaging-guided focused sonography as a treatment for essential tremor and to determine whether there was an association between these imaging features and the clinical response to MR imaging-guided focused sonography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with medication-refractory essential tremor prospectively gave consent; were enrolled in a single-site, FDA-approved pilot clinical trial; and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused sonography. MR imaging studies were obtained on a 3T scanner before the procedure and 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months following the procedure. RESULTS: On T2-weighted imaging, 3 time-dependent concentric zones were seen at the site of the focal spot. The inner 2 zones showed reduced ADC values at 24 hours in all patients except one. Diffusion had pseudonormalized by 1 month in all patients, when the cavity collapsed. Very mild postcontrast enhancement was seen at 24 hours and again at 1 month after MR imaging-guided focused sonography. The total lesion size and clinical response evolved inversely compared with each other (coefficient of correlation = 0.29, P value = .02). CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging-guided focused sonography can accurately ablate a precisely delineated target, with typical imaging findings seen in the days, weeks, and months following the treatment.

67,67,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysms of the cavernous segment of the ICA are difficult to treat with standard endovascular techniques, and ICA sacrifice achieves a high rate of occlusion but carries an elevated level of surgical complications and risk of de novo aneurysm formation. We report rates of occlusion and treatment-related data in 44 patients with cavernous sinus aneurysms treated with flow diversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with cavernous segment aneurysms treated with flow diversion were selected from a prospectively maintained data base of patients from 2009 to the present. Demographic information, treatment indications, number/type of flow diverters placed, outcome, complications (technical or clinical), and clinical/imaging follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 44 patients (37 females, 7 males) who had a flow diverter placed for treatment of a cavernous ICA aneurysm (mean age, 57.2; mean aneurysm size, 20.9 mm). The mean number of devices placed per patient was 2.2. At final angiographic follow-up (mean, 10.9 months), 71% had complete occlusion, and of those with incomplete occlusion, 40% had minimal remnants (<3 mm). In symptomatic patients, complete resolution or significant improvement in symptoms was noted in 90% at follow-up. Technical complications (which included, among others, vessel perforation in 4 patients, groin hematoma in 2, and asymptomatic carotid occlusion in 1) occurred in approximately 36% of patients but did not result in any clinical sequelae immediately or at follow-up.

68,68,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Basilar artery occlusion remains one of the most devastating subtypes of ischemic stroke. The prognosis is poor if early recanalization is not achieved. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of self-expanding retrievable stents in the endovascular treatment of acute basilar artery occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with acute basilar artery occlusion were treated with Solitaire FR or Revive SE devices between December 2009 and May 2012. Additional treatment included intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis (21/24) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/permanent stent placement (7/24). Recanalization was assessed by means of the TICI score. Clinical outcome was determined at discharge (NIHSS), and at 3 months (mRS). RESULTS: Median NIHSS score on admission was 24; median duration of symptoms was 254 minutes. Successful recanalization (TICI 2b + 3) by thrombectomy only was achieved in 18 patients (75%). Intracranial stent deployment after thrombectomy caused by underlying atherosclerotic stenosis was performed in 7 patients. If these patients with intracranial stent placement are included, successful recanalization was achieved in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%).

69,69,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pCONus is a new stentlike self-expanding nitinol implant with 4 distal petals, which is fully retrievable and electrolytically detachable. The distal end is implanted inside the aneurysm at the neck. The shaft is anchored in the parent vessel. In selected wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms, the pCONus was used to assist coiling. The device was evaluated for its safety and efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with 28 wide-neck aneurysms (9 recently ruptured) were treated with pCONus-assisted coiling at the discretion of the operator. Other treatment options were considered but were discarded due to anticipated difficulties. Technical issues, immediate posttreatment angiographic findings, clinical outcome, and follow-up imaging were assessed. RESULTS: There were 11 MCA, 7 anterior communicating artery, 1 posterior cerebral artery, 1 A2, and 8 basilar artery aneurysms. Insertion and deployment of the pCONus and subsequent coiling were possible in all cases. There were no clinically evident complications associated with the use of the device. Initial anatomic outcome showed 8 complete occlusions, 9 neck remnants, and 11 incomplete occlusions. Neurologic status remained unchanged at follow-up. Angiographic controls were obtained in 22 patients (mean, 7.5 months). Of these, 13 had complete occlusion, 9 showed improvement, and 7 were unchanged. Four died from SAH sequelae or other diseases, and 2 have not yet undergone follow-up. No intimal hyperplasia was observed.

We report our rate of hemorrhagic complications after endovascular treatment and analyze the clinical significance and potential mechanisms, with emphasis on cases of delayed hemorrhage after uneventful embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 10-year period, 846 embolization procedures were performed in 408 patients with brain AVMs. Any cases of hemorrhagic complications were identified and divided into those related or unrelated to a periprocedural arterial tear (during catheter navigation or catheter retrieval). We analyzed the following variables: sex, age, hemorrhagic presentation, Spetzler-Martin grade, size of the AVM, number of embolized pedicles, microcatheter used, type and volume of liquid embolic agent injected, and the presence of a premature venous occlusion. Univariate and multivariate multiple regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for hemorrhagic complications. RESULTS: A hemorrhagic complication occurred in 92 (11%) procedures. Forty-four (48%) complications were related to a periprocedural arterial perforation, and 48 (52%) were not. Hemorrhagic complications unrelated to an arterial perforation were located more commonly in the cerebral parenchyma, caused more neurologic deficits, and were associated with worse prognosis than those in the arterial perforation group. Only premature venous occlusion was identified as an independent predictor of hemorrhagic complication in the nonperforation group. Premature venous occlusion was significantly related to the ratio of Onyx volume to nidus diameter.

However, no studies have examined whether ADC characteristics are specific to this particular treatment. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether ADC histogram analysis is a bevacizumab-specific or treatment-independent biomarker of treatment response in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine bevacizumab-treated and 43 chemotherapy-treated recurrent glioblastoma multiformes never exposed to bevacizumab were included in this study. In all patients, ADC values in contrast-enhancing ROIs from MR imaging examinations performed at the time of recurrence, immediately before commencement of treatment for recurrence, were extracted and the resulting histogram was fitted to a mixed model with a double Gaussian distribution. Mean ADC in the lower Gaussian curve was used as the primary biomarker of interest. The Cox proportional hazards model and log-rank tests were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: Cox multivariate regression analysis accounting for the interaction between bevacizumab- and non-bevacizumab-treated patients suggested that the ability of the lower Gaussian curve to predict survival is dependent on treatment (progression-free survival, P = .045; overall survival, P = .003). Patients with bevacizumab-treated recurrent glioblastoma multiforme with a pretreatment lower Gaussian curve > 1.2 mu m(2)/ms had a significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival compared with bevacizumab-treated patients with a lower Gaussian curve < 1.2 mu m(2)/ms. No differences in progression-free survival or overall survival were observed in the chemotherapy-treated cohort. Bevacizumab-treated patients with a mean lower Gaussian curve > 1.2 mu m(2)/ms had a significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemotherapy-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The mean lower Gaussian curve from ADC histogram analysis is a predictive imaging biomarker for bevacizumab-treated, not chemotherapy-treated, recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme with a mean lower Gaussian curve > 1.2 mu m(2)/ms have a survival advantage when treated with bevacizumab.",Pretreatment ADC Histogram Analysis Is a Predictive Imaging Biomarker for Bevacizumab Treatment but Not Chemotherapy in Recurrent Glioblastoma,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2014,24136647,['MRI'],2.17,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.17,"['progression', 'cell invasion', 'vegf', 'images', 'growth', 'survival', 'maps']",tumor

77,77,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusional kurtosis imaging is an extension of DTI but includes non-Gaussian diffusion effects, allowing more comprehensive characterization of microstructural changes during brain development. Our purpose was to use diffusional kurtosis imaging to measure age-related microstructural changes in both the WM and GM of the developing human brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusional kurtosis imaging was performed in 59 subjects ranging from birth to 4 years 7 months of age. Diffusion metrics, fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis were collected from VOIs within multiple WM and GM structures and subsequently analyzed with respect to age. Diffusional kurtosis tractography images at various stages of development were also generated. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis both showed age-related increases in all WM regions, reflecting progression of diffusional anisotropy throughout development, predominantly in the first 2 years of life (eg, 70% and 157% increase in fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis, respectively, from birth to 2 years for the splenium). However, mean kurtosis detected continued microstructural changes in WM past the fractional anisotropy plateau, accounting for more delayed isotropic changes (eg, 90% of maximum fractional anisotropy was reached at 5 months, whereas 90% of maximum mean kurtosis occurred at 18 months for the external capsule). Mean kurtosis may also provide greater characterization of GM maturation (eg, the putamen showed no change in fractional anisotropy but an 81% change in mean kurtosis from birth to 4 years 7 months). CONCLUSIONS: Mean kurtosis detects significant microstructural changes consistent with known patterns of brain maturation. In comparison with fractional anisotropy, mean kurtosis may offer a more comprehensive evaluation of age-related microstructural changes in both WM and GM and is potentially a valuable technique for studying brain development.",Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging of the Developing Brain,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2014,24231848,['DTI'],2.1,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.1,"['nervous-system myelination', 'magnetic', 'gaussian water diffusion']",brain development
78,78,"The long-term complications of coil treatment of giant intracranial aneurysms were assessed in 334 instances when treatment consisted of only coiling (225), stent-assisted coiling (88), parent vessel occlusion (14), or balloon-assisted coiling (7). The authors concluded that coiling of large and giant aneurysms has reasonable safety profiles with good clinical outcomes, but aneurysm reopening was common. Stent-assisted coiling had lower recurrence, retreatment, and new or recurrent hemorrhage rates with no additional morbidity compared with conventional coiling. Aneurysm size was a major determinant of recanalization, retreatment, new or recurrent hemorrhage, and poor outcome. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Large and giant intracranial aneurysms are increasingly treated with endovascular techniques. The goal of this study was to retrospectively analyze the complications and long-term results of coiling in large and giant aneurysms (>= 10 mm) and identify predictors of outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 334 large or giant aneurysms (>= 10 mm) were coiled in our institution between 2004 and 2011. Medical charts and imaging studies were reviewed to determine baseline characteristics, procedural complications, and clinical/angiographic outcomes. Aneurysm size was 15 mm on average. Two hundred twenty-five aneurysms were treated with conventional coiling; 88, with stent-assisted coiling; 14, with parent vessel occlusion; and 7, with balloon-assisted coiling. RESULTS: Complications occurred in 10.5% of patients, with 1 death (0.3%). Aneurysm location and ruptured aneurysms predicted complications. Angiographic follow-up was available for 84% of patients at 25.4 months on average. Recanalization and retreatment rates were 39% and 33%, respectively. Larger aneurysm size, increasing follow-up time, conventional coiling, and aneurysm location predicted both recurrence and retreatment. The annual rebleeding rate was 1.9%. Larger aneurysm size, increasing follow-up time, and aneurysm location predicted new or recurrent hemorrhage. Favorable outcomes occurred in 92% of patients. Larger aneurysm size, poor Hunt and Hess grades, and new or recurrent hemorrhage predicted poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Coiling of large and giant aneurysms has a reasonable safety profile with good clinical outcomes, but aneurysm reopening remains very common.

81,81,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A limitation in postoperative monitoring of patients with glioblastoma is the lack of objective measures to quantify residual and recurrent disease. Automated computer-assisted volumetric analysis of contrast-enhancing tissue represents a potential tool to aid the radiologist in following these patients. In this study, we hypothesize that computer-assisted volumetry will show increased precision and speed over conventional 1D and 2D techniques in assessing residual and/or recurrent tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with native glioblastomas with MR imaging performed at 24-48 hours following resection and 2-4 months postoperatively. 1D and 2D measurements were performed by 2 neuroradiologists with Certificates of Added Qualification. Volumetry was performed by using manual segmentation and computer-assisted volumetry, which combines region-based active contours and a level set approach. Tumor response was assessed by using established 1D, 2D, and volumetric standards. Manual and computer-assisted volumetry segmentation times were compared. Interobserver correlation was determined among 1D, 2D, and volumetric techniques. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were analyzed. Discrepancy in disease status between 1D and 2D compared with computer-assisted volumetry was 10.3% (3/29) and 17.2% (5/29), respectively. The mean time for segmentation between manual and computer-assisted volumetry techniques was 9.7 minutes and < 1 minute, respectively (P < .01).

83,83,"Boxers and mixed martial arts athletes underwent brain DTI and the results were correlated with number of fights, knockouts, age, weight, and years of education. Total knockouts in boxers increased diffusivity in the corpus callosum, cingulate, pericalcarine, precuneus, and amygdala, while in martial arts athletes only the posterior cingulate was abnormal. Thus, fight exposure but not the number of fights can be used to predict microstructural brain damage. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traumatic brain injury is common in fighting athletes such as boxers, given the frequency of blows to the head. Because DTI is sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter, this technique is often used to investigate white matter integrity in patients with traumatic brain injury. We hypothesized that previous fight exposure would predict DTI abnormalities in fighting athletes after controlling for individual variation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 74 boxers and 81 mixed martial arts fighters were included in the analysis and scanned by use of DTI. Individual information and data on fight exposures, including number of fights and knockouts, were collected. A multiple hierarchical linear regression model was used in region-of-interest analysis to test the hypothesis that fight-related exposure could predict DTI values separately in boxers and mixed martial arts fighters. Age, weight, and years of education were controlled to ensure that these factors would not account for the hypothesized effects. RESULTS: We found that the number of knockouts among boxers predicted increased longitudinal diffusivity and transversal diffusivity in white matter and subcortical gray matter regions, including corpus callosum, isthmus cingulate, pericalcarine, precuneus, and amygdala, leading to increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy in the corresponding regions. The mixed martial arts fighters had increased transversal diffusivity in the posterior cingulate. The number of fights did not predict any DTI measures in either group.

The purpose of this study was to objectively characterize these dynamics, classify them, and connect them to aneurysm rupture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Image-based computational fluid dynamic simulations were used to re-create the hemodynamics of 210 patient-specific intracranial aneurysm geometries. The hemodynamics were then classified according to their spatial complexity and temporal stability by using quantities derived from vortex core lines and proper orthogonal decomposition. RESULTS: The quantitative classification was compared with a previous qualitative classification performed by visual inspection. Receiver operating characteristic curves provided area-under-the-curve estimates for spatial complexity (0.905) and temporal stability (0.85) to show that the 2 classifications were in agreement. Statistically significant differences were observed in the quantities describing the hemodynamics of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Specifically, ruptured aneurysms had more complex and more unstable flow patterns than unruptured aneurysms. Spatial complexity was more strongly associated with rupture than temporal stability.

85,85,"The authors used DTI to study posttraumatic white matter changes over a 5-year period. Thirteen patients with severe injuries acutely showed significant fractional anisotropy decreases in the corpus callosum and corona radiata when compared with controls. These abnormalities progressed at 2 years and then remained stable until 5 years. The DTI abnormalities correlated with sequelae such as amnesia, aphasia, and dyspraxia. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extensive white matter damage has been documented in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, yet how this damage evolves in the long term is not well understood. We used DTI to study white matter changes at 5 years after traumatic brain injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 8 healthy control participants and 13 patients with severe traumatic brain injury who were enrolled in a prospective observational study, which included clinical assessment and brain MR imaging in the acute setting (< 6 weeks) and 2 years and 5 years after injury. Only subjects with mild to moderate disability or no disability at 1 year were included in this analysis. DTI parameters were measured in 20 different brain regions and were normalized to values obtained in an age-matched control group. RESULTS: In the acute setting, fractional anisotropy was significantly lower in the genu and body of the corpus callosum and in the bilateral corona radiata in patients compared with control participants, whereas radial diffusivity was significantly (P < .05) higher in these tracts. At 2 years, fractional anisotropy in these tracts had further decreased and radial diffusivity had increased. No significant changes were detected between 2 and 5 years after injury. The baseline radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values in the anterior aspect of the brain stem, genu and body of the corpus callosum, and the right and left corona radiata were significantly (P < .05) associated with neurocognitive sequelae (including amnesia, aphasia, and dyspraxia) at year 5.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics were used to simulate hemodynamic profiles, including the presence of jet flow, energy loss, volume flow, and wall shear stress in 4 successful occlusions of aneurysms and 4 failed cases after flow-diverter deployment. In these 4 failed cases, hemodynamic profiles were examined again after a hypothetic second intervention. This involved replacing the failed flow diverter with a hypothetic optimally deployed flow diverter or simulated placement of a second flow diverter within the first (double hypothetic optimally deployed). RESULTS: Where successful occlusions were achieved, a marked obliteration of jet flow was observed.

The aim of this study was to investigate brain GM volumes and intrinsic structural WM changes in first-contact, antipsychotic drug-naive patients with schizophrenia.

90,90,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DWI has been increasingly used to characterize orbital masses and provides quantitative information in the form of the ADC, but studies of DWI of orbital masses have shown a range of reported sensitivities, specificities, and optimal threshold ADC values for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Our goal was to determine the optimal use of DWI for imaging orbital masses through aggregation of data from multiple centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Source data from 3 previous studies of orbital mass DWI were aggregated, and additional published data points were gathered. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and optimal ADC thresholds for distinguishing benign from malignant masses. RESULTS: There was no single ADC threshold that characterized orbital masses as benign or malignant with high sensitivity and specificity. An ADC of less than 0.93 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s was more than 90% specific for malignancy, and an ADC of less than 1.35 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s was more than 90% sensitive for malignancy. With these 2 thresholds, 33% of this cohort could be characterized as likely malignant, 29% as likely benign, and 38% as indeterminate. CONCLUSIONS: No single ADC threshold is highly sensitive and specific for characterizing orbital masses as benign or malignant. If we used 2 thresholds to divide these lesions into 3 categories, however, a majority of orbital masses can be characterized with >90% confidence.","Diffusion-Weighted Imaging of Orbital Masses: Multi-Institutional Data Support a 2-ADC Threshold Model to Categorize Lesions as Benign, Malignant, or Indeterminate",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2014,23868150,['DTI'],2.03,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.03,"['mri', 'head', 'tumors', 'diagnosis', 'coefficient values', 'simulating lesions']",tumor

The purpose of this study was to test the predictive value of the initial and final area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging to differentiate pseudoprogression from early tumor progression in patients with glioblastomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients who showed new or enlarged, contrast-enhancing lesions within the radiation field after concurrent chemoradiotherapy were assessed by use of conventional and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging. The bimodal histogram parameters of the area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio, which included the mean area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio at a higher curve (mAUCR(H)), 3 cumulative histogram parameters (AUCR(50), AUCR(75), and AUCR(90)), and the area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio at mode (AUCR(mode)), were calculated and correlated with the final pathologic or clinical diagnosis. The best predictor for differentiation of pseudoprogression from early tumor progression was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. RESULTS: Seventy-nine study patients were subsequently classified as having pseudoprogression (n = 37, 46.8%) or early tumor progression (n = 42, 53.2%). There were statistically significant differences of mAUCR(H), AUCR(50), AUCR(75), AUCR(90), and AUCR(mode) between the 2 groups (P < .0001, each). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed the mAUCR(H) to be the best single predictor of pseudoprogression, with a sensitivity of 90.1% and a specificity of 82.9%.

After exclusion of one patient, 66 Solitaire AB stents were used to treat via endovascular approach 64 aneurysms (63 patients) in seven European centers. Technical and clinical complications were recorded. A core laboratory evaluated the angiographic efficacy by using the Raymond classification scale. The mean width of aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Complete occlusion was achieved in 27 aneurysms (42.2 %); neck remnant was seen in 25 aneurysms (39.1 %) and aneurysm remnant in 12 aneurysms (18.7 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure were encountered in eight patients (12.7 %). Postprocedural modification of the clinical status was observed in one patient (1.6 %). No patients died (0 %); one had a permanent deficit (1.6 %), and one had a transient deficit (1.6 %). Treatment-related mortality was 0 %, and permanent morbidity was 1.6 %. The Solitaire AB stent has an excellent rate of technical success navigation with the absence of dislodgement.

97,97,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional 3D-DSA volumes are reconstructed from a series of projections containing temporal information. It was our purpose to develop a technique which would generate fully time-resolved 3D-DSA vascular volumes having better spatial and temporal resolution than that which is available with CT or MR angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a single contrast injection, projections from the mask and fill rotation are subtracted to create a series of vascular projections. With the use of these projections, a conventional conebeam CT reconstruction is generated (conventional 3D-DSA). This is used to constrain the reconstruction of individual 3D temporal volumes, which incorporate temporal information from the acquired projections (4D-DSA). RESULTS: Typically, 30 temporal volumes per second are generated with the use of currently available flat detector systems, a factor of similar to 200 increase over that achievable with the use of multiple gantry rotations. Dynamic displays of the reconstructed volumes are viewable from any angle. Good results have been obtained by using both intra-arterial and intravenous injections. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to generate time-resolved 3D-DSA vascular volumes with the use of commercially available flat detector angiographic systems and clinically practical injection protocols.

98,98,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Arteriovenous malformations are an important etiology of hemorrhagic stroke. However, current imaging modalities and risk do not provide insights into individual AVM hemodynamics and its role in pathophysiology. The aims of this study are to determine whether intracranial 4D flow MR imaging can provide insights into arteriovenous malformation hemodynamics independent of the Spetzler-Martin grade and to report the changes in flow observed during staged embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracranial 3D blood flow was assessed in 20 patients with AVM (age = 39 +/- 15 years, Spetzler-Martin grade ranging from 1-4) with the use of 4D flow MR imaging (temporal resolution = 45 ms, spatial resolution = [1.2-1.6mm](3)). AVM hemodynamics were visualized by means of time-integrated 3D pathlines depicting the AVM arterial feeding and venous draining patterns over the cardiac cycle. Analysis included the grading of feeding and draining velocities on a 3-point scale (0 = low <25 cm/s, 1 = medium <50 cm/s, 2 = high >50 cm/s). For 4 of 20 patients undergoing 4D flow MR imaging follow-up after staged embolization, peak velocities were quantified in arterial feeders, draining veins, the sagittal sinus, and contralateral arteries. RESULTS: In 50% of the cases with Spetzler-Martin grade >2, heterogeneous flow (velocity grade differences >1) was found across arteries and veins. Velocities in draining veins increased from Spetzler-Martin grade = 1 (grading = 0.5 +/- 0.6) to Spetzler-Martin grade >= 3 (1.1 +/- 0.6), whereas arterial velocities were similar (1.7 +/- 0.6 versus 1.5 +/- 0.6). In the postembolization subgroup of 4 patients, 4D flow MR imaging demonstrated successively more compact AVM and redistribution of velocities.

99,99,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MRIs are obtained in research in healthy and clinical populations, and incidental findings have been reported. Most studies have examined adults with variability in parameters of image acquisition and clinical measures available. We conducted a prospective study of youths and documented the frequency and concomitants of incidental findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Youths (n = 1400) with an age range from 8-23 years were imaged on the same 3T scanner, with a standard acquisition protocol providing 1.0 mm(3) isotropic resolution of anatomic scans. All scans were reviewed by an experienced board-certified neuroradiologist and were categorized into 3 groups: 1) normal: no incidental findings; 2) coincidental: incidental finding(s) were noted, further reviewed with an experienced pediatric neuroradiologist, but were of no clinical significance; 3) incidental findings that on further review were considered to have potential clinical significance and participants were referred for appropriate clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 148 incidental findings (10.6% of sample) were noted, and of these, 12 required clinical follow-up. Incidental findings were not related to age. However, whites had a higher incidence of pineal cysts, and males had a higher incidence of cavum septum pellucidum, which was associated with psychosis-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Incidental findings, moderated by race and sex, occur in approximately one-tenth of participants volunteering for pediatric research, with few requiring follow-up. The incidence supports a 2-tiered approach of neuroradiologic reading and clinical input to determine the potential significance of incidental findings detected on research MR imaging scans.",Incidental Findings in Youths Volunteering for Brain MRI Research,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2013,23811972,['MRI'],1.9,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.9,"['schizophrenia', 'reliability', 'disorders', 'metaanalysis', 'resonance']",schizophrenia
100,100,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pathologic changes in GM have an important role in MS. We investigated the association between SDGM and cortical volume changes and disability progression in early RRMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty patients with RRMS had clinical assessment during 5 years and were divided into those with or without SDP at 5 years by the usual definition in treatment trials. The number of available MR imaging scans at various time points was the following: at baseline, 178; and at 6 months, 172; at 12 months, 175; at 24 months, 155; at 36 months, 160; at 48 months, 158; and at 60 months, 162, respectively. Longitudinal changes in cortical, GM, and WM volume were calculated by using the direct method. RESULTS: At 5 years, 90 patients with RRMS experienced SDP and 90 had stable disease. At baseline, patients with SDP had longer disease duration, greater T2-lesion volume, and smaller whole-brain, WM, cortical, and SDGM volume (P < .01). At 5 years, patients with SDP had significantly greater percentage decreases from baseline compared with those without SDP in the volume of the whole brain (P < .0001), cortex (P = .001), GM (P = .003), and thalamus (P = .01). In patients who developed SDP at 5 years and those who did not, mixed-effect models, adjusted for age, disease duration, and change of the treatment status, showed significant interactions between SDP status at 5 years and changes with time in whole-brain, cortical, lateral ventricle (all P < .001), thalamus (P = .006), and total SDGM (P = .0095) volume.

101,101,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indirectly images exchangeable solute protons resonating at frequencies different than bulk water. These solute protons are selectively saturated using low bandwidth RF irradiation and saturation is transferred to bulk water protons via chemical exchange, resulting in an attenuation of the measured water proton signal. CEST MRI is an advanced MRI technique with wide application potential due to the ability to examine complex molecular contributions. CEST MRI at high field (7 Tesla [7 T]) will improve the overall results due to increase in signal, T-1 relaxation time, and chemical shift dispersion. Increased field strength translates to enhanced quantification of the metabolite of interest, allowing more fundamental studies on underlying pathophysiology. CEST contrast is affected by several tissue properties, such as the concentrations of exchange partners and their rate of proton exchange, whose effects have been examined and explored in this review. We have highlighted the background of CEST MRI, typical implementation strategy, and complications at 7 T.",Application of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI for Endogenous Contrast at 7 Tesla,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2013,23402307,['MRI'],1.831501832,MRI,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,1.831501832,"['in-vivo', 'magnetization-transfer', 'water', 'cest', 'mri', '7 t', 'quantitative description']",CEST

This study compares the performance of 2 risk-categorization methods of selecting CT-detected incidental thyroid nodules for work-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 2 categorization methods were method A, based on nodule size 10 mm, and method B, a 3-tiered system based on aggressive imaging features, patient age younger than 35 years or nodule size of 15 mm. In part 1, the 2 categorization methods were applied to thyroid cancers in the SEER data base of the National Cancer Institute to compare the cancer capture rates and survival. In part two, 755 CT neck scans at our institution were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of ITNs of 5 mm, and the same 2 categorization methods were applied to the CT cases to compare the number of patients who would theoretically meet the criteria for work-up. Comparisons of proportions of subjects captured under methods A and B were made by using the McNemar test. RESULTS: For 84,720 subjects in the SEER data base, methods A and B each captured 74% (62,708/84,720 and 62,586/84,720, respectively) of malignancies. SEER subjects who would not have met the criteria for further work-up by both methods had equally excellent 10-year cause-specific and relative survival of >99%. For part 2, the prevalence of ITNs of 5 mm at our institution was 133/755 (18%). The number of ITNs that would be recommended for work-up by method A was 57/133 (43%) compared with 31/133 (23%) for method B (P < .0005).

105,105,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The spinal cord is a site of predilection for MS lesions. While diffusion tensor imaging is useful for the study of anisotropic systems such as WM tracts, it is of more limited utility in tissues with more isotropic microstructures (on the length scales studied with diffusion MR imaging) such as gray matter. In contrast, diffusional kurtosis imaging, which measures both Gaussian and non-Gaussian properties of water diffusion, provides more biomarkers of both anisotropic and isotropic structural changes. The aim of this study was to investigate the cervical spinal cord of patients with MS and to characterize lesional and normal-appearing gray matter and WM damage by using diffusional kurtosis imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients (13 women, mean age = 41.1 10.7 years) and 16 controls (7 women, mean age = 35.6 11.2-years) underwent MR imaging of the cervical spinal cord on a 3T scanner (T2 TSE, T1 magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo, diffusional kurtosis imaging, T2 fast low-angle shot). Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and mean kurtosis were measured on the whole cord and in normal-appearing gray matter and WM. RESULTS: Spinal cord T2-hyperintense lesions were identified in 18 patients. Whole spinal cord fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis (P = .0009, P = .003), WM fractional anisotropy (P = .01), and gray matter mean kurtosis (P = .006) were significantly decreased, and whole spinal cord mean diffusivity (P = .009) was increased in patients compared with controls. Mean spinal cord area was significantly lower in patients (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Diffusional kurtosis imaging of the spinal cord can provide a more comprehensive characterization of lesions and normal-appearing WM and gray matter damage in patients with MS.

NmMRI of 10 % formalin-fixed autopsied midbrains was performed in three cases (normal control, DLB, and PD) with a 3T imaging system, using a 3D gradient echo T1-weighted sequence with a magnetization transfer contrast pulse. Neuropathological examinations of the midbrains were performed, and the density of neuromelanin-positive neurons (number per square millimeter) was determined. The extent of iron deposition in the midbrain was also evaluated using ferritin immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we directly correlated the contrast signal ratio in the SNc and the density of neuromelanin-containing neurons. Diffuse hyperintense areas in the SNc reflected well-preserved neuromelanin-containing neurons in the normal control case, whereas an iso-intense area in the SNc showed severe loss of neuromelanin-containing neurons in the DLB and PD cases. Increased signal intensity in the SNc was apparently not influenced by iron deposition. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between signal intensity and the density of neuromelanin-containing neurons was seen in the SNc. Based on the direct correlation between postportem NmMRI and neuropathological findings, signal intensity in the SNc is closely related to the quantity of neuromelanin-containing neurons but is not influenced by iron deposition.",Correlation between pathology and neuromelanin MR imaging in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2013,23673875,['MRI'],2.281368821,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.281368821,"['t1', 'substantia', ""parkinson's disease (pd)"", 'substantia-nigra', 'brain', 'dementia with lewy bodies (dlb)', 'cerebral infarction', 'consortium', 'diagnosis']",parkinson

Eleven patients with iNPH (mean age: 73.6 years, range: 65-84), who underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging, including DKI before surgery, were recruited. Six age-matched, healthy subjects (mean age: 69.8 years, range: 60-75) served as the control group. DKI and diffusion tensor imaging parameters were calculated and compared between the iNPH and the control groups using tract-specific analysis of the CST at the level of the lateral ventricle. Mean diffusional kurtosis (DK) and axial diffusion kurtosis were significantly lower in iNPH patients. However, apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, and axial eigenvalue (lambda (1) ) were significantly higher in the iNPH group than in the control group. The mechanical pressure caused by ventricular enlargement in iNPH patients might induce formation of well-aligned fiber tracts and increased fiber density in the CST, resulting in decreased DK. DKI is able to depict both the altered microstructure and water molecule movement within neural axons and intra- or extracellular space.

METHODSFourteen definite-ALS patients and 12 age-matched controls underwent whole brain DTI on a 3T scanner. Mean-diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were obtained bilaterally from the basal ganglia and thalamus in the regions-of-interest (ROIs). RESULTSThe MD was significantly higher (P<.02) in basal ganglia and thalamus in patients with ALS compared with controls. Correspondingly, the FA was significantly lower (P<.02) in these structures, except in caudate (P=.04) and putamen (P=.06) in patients compared with controls. There were mild to strong correlations (r=.3-.7) between the DTI measures of basal ganglia and finger-tap, foot-tap, and lip-and-tongue movement rate.

The ratios of CBV and corrected CBV were calculated by dividing the tumor values by those obtained from contralateral NAWM. A paired t test was used to compare tumor K-2 and NAWM K-2, as well as tumor CBV ratios without and with leakage correction. Comparisons of CBV, corrected CBV, and K-2 between PCNSLs and glioblastomas were done by using a 2-sample t test. The diagnostic performance of DSC perfusion MR imaging without and with contrast-leakage correction was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

117,117,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular embolization of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms can be technically challenging, especially when the anatomy is complex. Stent reconstruction of the parent artery is commonly used to treat wide-neck and bifurcated aneurysms. The main objective of this study was to investigate the periprocedural and midterm morbidity and mortality results of this procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SENAT is a consecutive, prospective, multicentric study. Patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment with the Neuroform stent system were recruited and recorded. Technical outcomes and complications were also assessed. The midterm anatomic results were re-evaluated at 12-18 months. RESULTS: A total of 113 stents were used to treat the 107 aneurysms in 107 patients. The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 6.2 mm, and the mean diameter of aneurysm neck was 4.5 mm. The complete occlusion rate postprocedure was 66.4%. The rate of progressive occlusion at 12-18 months was 14%, and the rate of recurrence was 9.7%. The rate of subsequent treatment was 4%. The thromboembolic rate in the periprocedural period was 3.7%, and the rate of delayed TE events was 3%. Overall, the mortality rate at 12-18 months was 1%, and the permanent morbidity rate was 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coiling with the Neuroform stent system provides a high level of occlusion with low rates of subsequent treatment despite a predominant population of patients with wide-neck aneurysms.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of endovascular carotid repair with regard to vessel patency and retreatment rates.

The Biffl classification of blunt carotid arterial injuries with an additional modification to stratify grade 2 and 3 injuries into no-flow-limiting (2a/3a) and flow-limiting (2b/3b) was used to classify injuries. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients underwent 50 endovascular interventions. Forty-four were treated with stents alone, 4 required both stent and coil treatments, and 2 were treated with coils alone. Initial treatment resulted in complete restoration of the normal vessel lumen diameter in 25 (50%) treated vessels and good-to-acceptable restoration in 25 (50%) vessels. A single patient had complete stent occlusion. Three patients required stent and/or coil retreatment. There was no mortality or permanent morbidity relating to endovascular carotid artery repair.

119,119,"Flow diverting devices and stents can be used to treat cerebral aneurysms too difficult to treat with coiling or craniotomy and clipping. However, the hemodynamic effects of these devices have not been studied in depth. The objective of this study was to quantify and understand the fluid dynamic changes that occur within bifurcating aneurysms when treated with different devices and configurations. Two physical models of bifurcating cerebral aneurysms were constructed: an idealized model and a patient-specific model. The models were treated with four device configurations: a single low-porosity Pipeline embolization device (PED) and one, two, and three high-porosity Enterprise stents deployed in a telescoping fashion. Particle image velocimetry was used to measure the fluid dynamics within the aneurysms; pressure was measured within the patient-specific model. The PED resulted in the greatest reductions in fluid dynamic activity within the aneurysm for both models. However, a configuration of three telescoping stents reduced the fluid dynamic activity within the aneurysm similarly to the PED treatment. Pressure within the patient-specific aneurysm did not show significant changes among the treatment configurations; however, the pressure difference across the untreated vessel side of the model was greatest with the PED. Treatment with stents and a flow diverter led to reductions in aneurysmal fluid dynamic activity for both idealized and patient-specific models. While the PED resulted in the greatest flow reductions, telescoping high-porosity stents performed similarly and may represent a viable treatment alternative in situations where the use of a PED is not an option.",Flow diverter effect on cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics: an in vitro comparison of telescoping stents and the Pipeline,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2013,23515661,['CT'],2.376425856,CT,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.376425856,"['flow diverter', 'control grid interpolation', 'neuroform', 'particle image velocimetry', 'aneurysm', 'endovascular reconstruction', 'blood flow']",aneurysms

122,122,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute vertebrobasilar occlusion is an ominous disease with few proved effective treatments. Experience with stent retrievers is scarce and limited to combined therapies (stent retrievers associated with previous intravenous fibrinolysis, intra-arterial thrombolysis, or other mechanical devices). We present our experience with 18 patients treated with direct thrombectomy by using stent retrievers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with vertebrobasilar occlusion were treated with direct thrombectomy by using stent retrievers at our hospital. The mean age was 67.5 years. Clinical presentation was sudden deterioration in consciousness level in 61.2% and progressive or fluctuating brain stem symptoms in 38.8%. Stroke subtype (TOAST) was atherothrombotic (33.3%), undetermined (33.3%), cardioembolic (27.7%), and of unusual etiology (5.5%). RESULTS: The occlusion site was the vertebral artery in 1 case, proximal basilar artery in 4, middle basilar artery in 6, distal basilar artery in 5, and unilateral posterior cerebral artery in 2 cases. SRs included the Solitaire AB in 8 cases, Solitaire FR in 5 cases, and Trevo Pro in 5 cases. An 8F Merci balloon guide catheter was used in 15 patients, and a Neuron 6F, in 3 patients. Post-clot retrieval definitive intracranial stents were used in 5 patients (27.7%). Postprocedural TICI >= 2b was achieved in 17 patients (94.4%). Clinically, 72.2% of patients experienced an improved NIHSS score at discharge, 22.2% died, and in 5.5% the NIHSS scores did not change. The mRS score at 3 months was 0-2 in 9 patients (50%) and 3-5 in 5 patients (27.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Thrombectomy with stent retrievers is feasible in the treatment of vertebrobasilar occlusion. These initial results must be confirmed by further prospective studies with a larger number of cases.",Treatment of Acute Vertebrobasilar Occlusion Using Thrombectomy with Stent Retrievers: Initial Experience with 18 Patients,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2013,23124642,['Spectroscopy'],2.11,Spectroscopy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.11,"['basilar artery-occlusion', 'acute ischemic-stroke', 'mechanical']",stroke
123,123,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base are rare tumors with overlapping presentations and anatomic imaging features but different prognoses. We hypothesized that these tumors might be distinguished by using diffusion-weighted MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 19 patients with pathologically confirmed chordoma or chondrosarcoma who underwent both conventional and diffusion-weighted MR imaging. Differences in distributions of ADC were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Associations between histopathologic diagnosis and conventional MR imaging features (T2 signal intensity, contrast enhancement, and tumor location) were assessed with the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Chondrosarcoma was associated with the highest mean ADC value (2051 +/- 261 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) and was significantly different from classic chordoma (1474 +/- 117 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) and poorly differentiated chordoma (875 +/- 100 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) (P < .001). Poorly differentiated chordoma was characterized by low T2 signal intensity (P = .001), but other conventional MR imaging features of enhancement and/or lesion location did not reliably distinguish these tumor types.

124,124,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT in low dose technique is the criterion standard imaging modality for evaluation of the paranasal sinus. Our aim was to evaluate the dose-reduction potential of a recently available sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction technique, regarding noise, image quality, and time duration when evaluating this region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT was performed on a phantom head at different tube voltages (120 kV, 100 kV) and currents (100 mAs, 50 mAs, 25 mAs). Each protocol was reconstructed (in soft tissue and bony kernel) by using standard filtered back-projection and 5 different SAFIRE strengths, and image noise was evaluated. Subjective image quality was evaluated on noise-aligned image triplets acquired at tube currents of 100% (FBP), 50% (SAFIRE), and 25% (SAFIRE) by using a 5-point scale (1 = worst, 5 = best). The time duration for image reconstruction was noted for calculations with FBP and SAFIRE. RESULTS: SAFIRE reduced image noise by 15%-85%, depending on the iterative strength, rendering kernel, and dose parameters. Noise reduction was stronger at a bone kernel algorithm both in 1- and 3-mm images (P < .05). Subjective quality evaluation of the noise-adapted images showed preference for those acquired at 100% tube current with FBP (4.7-5.0) versus 50% dose with SAFIRE (3.4-4.4) versus 25% dose with SAFIRE (2.0-3.1). The time duration for FBP image sets was 2.9-6.6 images per second versus SAFIRE with 0.9-1.6 images per second. CONCLUSIONS: For CT of the paranasal sinus, SAFIRE algorithms are suitable for image-noise reduction. Because image quality decreases with dosage, careful choice of the appropriate iterative method is necessary to achieve an optimal balance between image noise and quality.",Performance of Iterative Image Reconstruction in CT of the Paranasal Sinuses: A Phantom Study,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2013,23221946,['CT'],1.9,CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.9,"['angiography', 'dose reduction', 'quality', 'algorithm']",Paranasal Sinuses

126,126,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antiplatelet therapy is associated with decreased ischemic events after neurointerventional procedures. Antiplatelet resistance negates the protective effects of antiplatelet medication, leading to a higher incidence of ischemic events. A possible link between antiplatelet hyper-response and increased hemorrhagic complications has been inadequately investigated. We aimed to examine the correlation between antiplatelet hyper-response and the risk of hemorrhagic complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who were treated with antiplatelet medications and underwent neurointerventional procedures were prospectively recruited. We collected the following data: demographics, vascular risk factors, antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment, antiplatelet responsiveness, coagulation profile, and hemorrhagic complications. P2Y12 receptor-mediated platelet inhibition was tested by using the VerifyNow assay device. The primary end points were postprocedural major and minor hemorrhagic complications. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the percentage of platelet inhibition as a diagnostic tool for bleeding events. The association between hemorrhage and percentage of platelet inhibition was investigated by using logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean age was 56 +/- 12 years, and 28% were men. Ten patients (21.3%) developed hemorrhagic complications. Clopidogrel response was higher in patients with a major bleeding complication compared with those with minor or no bleeding (median, 94% versus 24% platelet inhibition; P = .0084). Of the 7 patients (14.9%) defined as hyper-responders with >= 72% platelet inhibition, 42.8% had a major bleeding complication. CONCLUSIONS: Hyper-response to clopidogrel is associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic complications.

128,128,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-diverter stents modify intra-aneurysmal blood flow and induce the progressive thrombosis of intracranial aneurysms followed by stable vascular reconstruction. The aim of this study was to report a new method for the appraisal of intracranial blood flow from DSA performed during endovascular treatment procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 24 patients with unruptured IAs who underwent FDS implantation was prospectively recruited. Pre-and post-DSA sequences in combination with 3D rotational angiography were acquired. The quantification of arterial and intraaneurysmal flow was accomplished by using an optical flow approach. Flow reduction was assessed by using a new metric termed the mean aneurysm flow amplitude ratio. The correlation between the MAFA ratio and the incidence of aneurysm thrombosis was assessed by using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the Fisher exact test when the optimum Youden index was found. RESULTS: The quantification of flow was successfully achieved in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%). On the imaging follow-up, 18 aneurysms developed complete thrombosis (87.5%) and 3 displayed residual circulation (12.5%). The threshold analysis of the MAFA ratio significantly predicted thrombosis at 12 months below a threshold of 1.03 (P=.035). There was no significant correlation between the time for complete occlusion of the aneurysm and contrast stagnation inside the aneurysm after treatment (P>.05).

130,130,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 7T MR imaging has led to improved detection and classification of cortical MS lesions, mainly based on T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences. Depiction of cortical GM by using the recommended MS imaging protocol has not yet been investigated at 7T. We aimed to investigate prospectively which recommended sequence for clinical use has the highest value at 7T, in terms of GM and WM lesion detection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with MS (mean age, 43.8 years; 25 women) and 7 healthy controls (mean age, 40.4 years; 5 women) underwent multicontrast 7T MR imaging including the recommended clinical 2D-T2WI, 3D-T1WI, 3D-FLAIR, and GM-specific 3D-DIR. Lesions were scored and categorized anatomically by 3 raters, in consensus. The value of sequences was evaluated lesion-wise and patient-wise (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). RESULTS: At 7T, 3D-FLAIR detected the highest number of total cortical GM lesions (217), 89% more than 3D-DIR and 87% and 224% more than 2D-T2WI and 3D-T1WI. Patient-wise analysis showed that this difference between 3D-FLAIR and 3D-DIR was statistically significant (P < .04), and most pronounced for the number of mixed lesions (P < .03). 3D-FLAIR also detected the highest number of total WM lesions (2605), but the difference with 3D-DIR and 3D-T1WI was not significant.

131,131,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Effects of blood flow modification by flow diverters are observed to lead often to aneurysm thrombosis and reverse remodeling. For this process, to further understand the potential roles of intra-aneurysmal blood pressure changes and aneurysm morphologies, 23 patients were studied by numeric simulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D imaging of aneurysms of different sizes and shapes, all located at the supraclinoid segment of the ICA (n = 23), was prepared for CFD simulations. Hemodynamic variables were calculated for conditions before and after virtual FD implantation, reconstituting a vessel wall scaffold across the aneurysm neck. WSS, velocity, residence time, turnover time, and intra-aneurysmal pressure were assessed statistically. RESULTS: After placement of FDs, significant reductions inside the aneurysm were observed for most hemodynamic variables (P <.01) except mean intra-aneurysmal pressures. For minimum/maximum intra-aneurysmal pressure values, small but significant changes were found; however, they were considered too small to be of relevance. CONCLUSIONS: Calculations in 23 cases did not reveal significant intra-aneurysmal mean or peak pressure changes, indicating a minor role of pressure changes in the rare event of secondary ruptures after FD use. Other hemodynamic variables (WSS and velocity) exhibited more significant changes, indicating their role in intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation. Size-dependent, significantly higher reduction in WSS (P = .069) and velocity (P = .013) was observed in small aneurysms compared with larger ones.

We describe the clinical presentation, radiologic features, and clinical outcome of 13 patients with fusiform basilar trunk aneurysms treated with flow diverters, stents, and coils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 13 patients, 7 were men and 6 were women with a mean age of 59.7 years. Clinical presentation was SAH in 3 patients, mass effect on the brain stem in 4 patients, vertebral artery dissection in 1 patient, and the aneurysm was an incidental finding in 5 patients. Mean aneurysm size was 21 mm. All except 1 were large or giant aneurysms. Nine aneurysms were partially thrombosed. RESULTS: Stents were used in all 13 patients, in 2 patients with additional flow diverters and in 11 patients with additional coils. In 4 patients, 1 vertebral artery was subsequently occluded with coils to decrease flow into the aneurysm. Of 13 patients, 9 had a good outcome with adequate aneurysm occlusion and stable size on follow-up of 6-72 months. One of 3 patients who presented with SAH died of a rebleed 1 month later. One other patient died soon after treatment of in-stent thrombosis, and another patient became mute after treatment. In 2 of 3 patients who presented with symptoms of mass effect, there was improvement at a follow-up of 6-24 months.

133,133,"4D phase contrast MR imaging (4D PC MRI) has been introduced for spatiotemporal evaluation of intracranial hemodynamics in various cerebrovascular diseases. However, it still lacks validation with standards of reference. Our goal was to compare blood flow quantification derived from 4D PC MRI with transcranial ultrasound and 2D PC MRI. Velocity measurements within large intracranial arteries [internal carotid artery (ICA), basilar artery (BA), and middle cerebral artery (MCA)] were obtained in 20 young healthy volunteers with 4D and 2D PC MRI, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), and transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD). Maximum velocities at peak systole (PSV) and end diastole (EDV) were compared using regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Correlation of 4D PC MRI measured velocities was higher in comparison with TCD (r = 0.49-0.66) than with TCCD (0.35-0.44) and 2D PC MRI (0.52-0.60). In mid-BA and ICA C7 segment, a significant correlation was found with TCD (0.68-0.81 and 0.65-0.71, respectively). No significant correlation was found in carotid siphon. On average over all volunteers, PSVs and EDVs in MCA were minimally underestimated compared with TCD/TCCD. Minimal overestimation of velocities was found compared to TCD in mid-BA and ICA C7 segment. 4D PC MRI appears as valid alternative for intracranial velocity measurement consistent with previous reference standards, foremost with TCD. Spatiotemporal averaging effects might contribute to vessel size-dependent mild underestimation of velocities in smaller (MCA), and overestimation in larger-sized (BA and ICA) arteries, respectively. Complete spatiotemporal flow analysis may be advantageous in anatomically complex regions (e.g. carotid siphon) relative to restrictions of ultrasound techniques.",Intracranial artery velocity measurement using 4D PC MRI at 3 T: comparison with transcranial ultrasound techniques and 2D PC MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2013,23143179,['MRI'],2.091254753,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.091254753,"['intracranial artery velocity', 'internal carotid-artery', 'phase contrast (pc) mr imaging', 'phase-contrast mri', 'basal cerebral-arteries', '4d pc mri']",cerebrovascular disease
134,134,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Braided self-expandable stents and flow diverters of uniform construction may develop zones of heterogeneous porosity in vivo. Unwanted stenoses may also occur at the extremities of the device. We studied these phenomena in dedicated benchtop experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five braided devices of decreasing porosity were studied. To simulate discrepancies in diameters between the landing zones of the parent vessel and the aneurysm neck area, device extremities were inserted into silicone tubes of various diameters (2-3 mm), leaving the midportion free to react to experimental manipulations, which included axial approximation of the tubes (0-7 mm), and curvature (0-135 degrees), with or without axial compression (0-2 mm). The length of the landing zone was sequentially decreased to study terminal device stenosis. RESULTS: All devices adopted a conformation characterized by 3 different zones: bilateral landing zones, a middle compaction zone, and 2 transition zones. It is possible, during deployment, to compact stents and FDs to decrease porosity, but a limiting factor was the transition zone, which remained relatively unchanged and of higher porosity than the expansion zone. Length of the transition zone increased when devices were constrained in smaller tubes. Heterogeneities in porosity with compaction and curvatures were predictable and followed simple geometric rules. Extremity stenoses occurred increasingly with decreasing length of the landing zone. CONCLUSIONS: Braided self-expandable devices show predictable changes in porosity according to device size, vessel diameter, and curvature. Adequate landing zones are required to prevent terminal device stenosis.",The Varying Porosity of Braided Self-Expanding Stents and Flow Diverters: An Experimental Study,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2013,22878007,['angiography'],2.39,angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.39,"['hemodynamics', 'aneurysms', 'experimental-model']",aneurysms

We undertook this study to assess the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in the differential diagnosis of individual patients with clinical parkinsonism. ""Visual"" and ""computer-supported"" reading of the fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scans were used for image interpretation and compared with each other. One hundred thirty-six parkinsonian patients were referred from movement disorder clinics in specialty neurology centers for the fluorodeoxyglucose-PET study. Imaging-based diagnosis was obtained by visual assessment of individual scans by a PET physician blinded to the clinical diagnosis and also by computer-assisted interpretation using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. The results were compared with a 2-year follow-up clinical assessment made by a movement disorder specialist. Concordance of visual evaluation of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET with clinical diagnosis was achieved in 91.7 % of patients scanned, 97.6 % IPD, 80 % MSA, 76.6 % PSP, and 100 % CBS. Blinded computer assessment using SPM was concordant with the clinical diagnosis in 91 % of cases evaluated (90.4 % IPD, 80 % MSA, 93.3 % PSP, and 100 % CBS).

Twenty three patients (42 eyes; 9 men, 14 women) with primary closed-angle glaucoma and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Both DTI and OCT were performed on the optic nerves of all subjects. The mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and eigenvalue maps were obtained for quantitative analysis. RNFL thickness and quantitative electrophysiology were also performed on all subjects. The association of quantitative DTI with RNFL thickness and glaucoma stage was analyzed. Compared with control nerves, the FA, lambda(aEuro-), and lambda(aSyen) values, and RNFL thickness in affected nerves decreased, while MD increased in patients with primary glaucoma (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between FA, MD, lambda(aEuro-), and lambda(aSyen) and the mean RNFL thickness (P < 0.01). The mean FA and lambda(aSyen) values derived with DT MR imaging correlated well with glaucoma stage (P < 0.05), but the mean MD and lambda(aEuro-) values did not correlate with glaucoma stage (P > 0.05).

137,137,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The best approach between general anesthesia and conscious sedation to perform mechanical thrombectomy remains unknown. The goal of our study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy under conscious sedation in patients with acute ischemic stroke, using the Solitaire FR device, in a prospective, single-center, single-arm study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a large artery occlusion within 6 hours of symptom onset for the anterior circulation, and within 24 hours for the posterior circulation. After intravenous thrombolysis (when no contraindications), thrombectomy was performed with the Solitaire device in patients under conscious sedation. Primary efficacy and safety end points were good functional outcome (mRS 2) at 3 months and mortality at 3 months. Secondary end points were recanalization (TICI 2) and failure rate. RESULTS: From May 2010 to July 2011, 36 patients were treated. Median baseline NIHSS score was 17.5. The occlusion site was MCA in 21 patients (58.4%), ICA-MCA tandem occlusion in 9 patients (25.0%), terminal ICA in 2 patients (5.5%), and basilar artery in 4 patients (11.1%). Twenty-three patients (63.9%) received intravenous thrombolysis. Superselective catheterization of the occluded vessel was not feasible in 5/36 cases (13.9%). Successful revascularization was achieved in 28/36 patients (77.8%). After 3 months, 22 patients (61.1%) showed good functional outcome (mRS 2) and the median NIHSS score was 8.5. Overall mortality rate at 3 months was 22.2% (8/36).

139,139,"Previous reports have suggested that endovascular parent artery occlusion is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of vertebral artery dissection (VAD). However, the results of long-term outcomes are still unclear. This study reviewed the clinical and imaging outcomes of patients with VAD treated by endovascular internal trapping. A total of 73 patients were treated for VAD by endovascular internal trapping between March 1998 and March 2011. Patients were regularly followed up by magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and clinical examinations. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale. Forty-five patients had ruptured VADs, and 28 had unruptured VADs. Clinical follow-up of at least 6 months data was obtained for 61 patients (83.6 %). The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 145 months (mean +/- SD, 55.6 +/- 8.9 months). Two patients with ruptured VADs had recurrence (2.74 %). Cranial nerve paresis (CNP) was observed in six patients (8.21 %), spinal cord infarction in two patients (2.74 %), and a perforating artery ischemia was diagnosed in seven patients (9.59 %); all patients with CNP and five of the patients with partial Wallenberg syndrome experienced only temporary symptoms; two of the patients with partial Wallenberg syndrome had permanent neurological deficits. Despite their symptoms, most patients were in good general condition, as shown by their clinical scores. The results of this study have proven that endovascular internal trapping is a stable and durable treatment for closure of VADs. Recanalization is rather rare and occurred only in ruptured cases, both within 3 months after initial treatment without rupture. CNPs were observed in 8.21 %, perforating ischemia in 9.59 %, and spinal cord infarction in 2.74 %. The former two are temporary, while the last can be a factor that affects the modified Rankin Scale. Patients rated their quality of life as good, as corroborated by their posttreatment clinical score.

143,143,"BACKGROUND Although multiple studies demonstrate benefits of high field imaging of cerebrovasculature, a detailed quantitative analysis of complete cerebrovascular system is unavailable. To compare quality of MR angiography (MRA) acquisitions at various field strengths, we used 3-dimensional (3D) geometric cerebrovascular models extracted from 1.5T/3T/7T scans. METHODS The 3D cerebrovascular models were compared in volume, length, and number of branches. A relationship between the vascular length and volume was statistically derived. Acquisition performance was benchmarked against the maximum volume at infinitive length. RESULTS The numbers of vessels discernible on 1.5T/3T/7T are 138/363/907. 3T shows 3.3(1.9) and 7T 1.2(9.1) times more arteries (veins) than 1.5T. The vascular lengths and volumes at 1.5T/3T/7T are 3.7/12.5/22.7 m and 15.8/26.6/28.0 cm3. For arteries: 3T-1.5T gain is very high in length, high in volume; 7T-3T gain is medium in length, small in volume. For veins: 3T-1.5T gain is moderate in length, high in volume; 7T-3T gain is very high in length, moderate in volume. 1.5T shows merely half of vascular volume. At 3T 6%, while at 7T only 1% of vascular volume is missing. CONCLUSION Our approach differs from standard approaches based on visual assessment and signal (contrast)-to-noise ratio. It also measures absolute acquisition performance, provides a unique length-volume relationship, and predicts length/volume for intermediate teslages.","Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Angiography Scans on 1.5, 3, and 7 Tesla Units: A Quantitative Study of 3-Dimensional Cerebrovasculature",JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2013,21447031,['Angiography'],2.014652015,Angiography,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.014652015,"['flight mr-angiography', 'cerebral', 'high field imaging', 'anatomy', 'magnetic resonance angiography', 'atlas', 'segmentation']",atlas

145,145,"The persistent trigeminal artery (PTA) is the most common and most cephalad-located embryological anastomosis between the developing carotid artery and vertebrobasilar system to persist into adulthood. As such, it is frequently reported as an incidental finding in computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography studies. Here, we review the embryology, anatomy, and angiographic imaging findings, including important variants of this commonly encountered cerebrovascular anomaly (reported incidence of PTA/PTA variants ranges from 0.1% to 0.76%). Further, the aim is to present the range of associated arterial anomalies or syndromes, as well as pathologies that are associated with a PTA: aneurysms, trigeminal cavernous fistulas, and trigeminal nerve compression. Besides summarizing the risks and clinical presentation of such pathologies, their management is discussed with endovascular strategies mostly being the primary choice for aneurysms and trigeminal cavernous fistulas. Symptomatic trigeminal nerve compression can be treated with microvascular decompression surgery. As an illustrative example, a case of a trigeminal cavernous fistula on a PTA variant is included, mainly to emphasize the importance of understanding the variant anatomy for treatment planning in such pathologies.

Here, we test whether objective quantification of intratumoral SWI patterns by applying fractal analysis can offer reliable indexes capable of differentiating glial tumor grades. Thirty-six patients affected by brain gliomas (grades II-IV, according to the WHO classification system) underwent MRI at 7 T using a SWI protocol. All images were collected and analyzed by applying a computer-aided fractal image analysis, which applies the fractal dimension as a measure of geometrical complexity of intratumoral SWI patterns. The results were subsequently statistically correlated to the histopathological tumor grade. The mean value of the fractal dimension of the intratumoral SWI patterns was 2.086 +/- 0.413.

146,146,"Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) with high- and ultra-high-field magnetic resonance is a very helpful tool for evaluating brain gliomas and intratumoral structures, including microvasculature. Here, we test whether objective quantification of intratumoral SWI patterns by applying fractal analysis can offer reliable indexes capable of differentiating glial tumor grades. Thirty-six patients affected by brain gliomas (grades II-IV, according to the WHO classification system) underwent MRI at 7 T using a SWI protocol. All images were collected and analyzed by applying a computer-aided fractal image analysis, which applies the fractal dimension as a measure of geometrical complexity of intratumoral SWI patterns. The results were subsequently statistically correlated to the histopathological tumor grade. The mean value of the fractal dimension of the intratumoral SWI patterns was 2.086 +/- 0.413. We found a trend of higher fractal dimension values in groups of higher histologic grade.

148,148,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The time from arterial puncture to successful recanalization is an important milestone toward timely recanalization. With the significant improvement in recanalization rates by using thrombectomy devices, procedural time to recanalization is becoming a determinant factor in choosing among available devices. We aimed to assess the impact of time to recanalization on the outcome of intra-arterial stroke therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting procedural times in patients with stroke treated with the MD, PS, and RS. RESULTS: We identified 16 eligible studies: 4 on the MD (n = 357), 8 on the PS (n = 455), and 4 on RS (n = 113). Merci device studies described total procedural duration, while PS and RS studies described puncture-to-recanalization times. With a random-effects model, mean procedural duration for the MD was 120 minutes (95% CI, 105.7-134.2 minutes). Mean puncture to recanalization time for the PS was 64.6 minutes (95% CI, 44.4-84.8 minutes) and 54.7 minutes for RS (95% CI, 47.3-62.2 minutes). Successful recanalization was achieved in 211 of 357 patients (59.1%) in the MD studies (95% CI, 49.3-77.7), 394 of 455 (86.6%) in the PS studies (95% CI, 84.1-93.8), and 105 of 113 (92.9%) in the RS studies (95% CI, 90.9-99.9). Functional independence (mRS <= 2) was achieved in 31.5% of patients in the MD studies, 36.6% in the PS studies, and 46.9% in the RS studies. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the PS and RS was associated with comparable procedural time to recanalization. Available data did not allow this parameter to be determined for trials using the MD. Retrievable stents achieved the highest rate of successful recanalization and functional outcome and the lowest mortality.","A Meta-Analysis of Observational Intra-Arterial Stroke Therapy Studies Using the Merci Device, Penumbra System, and Retrievable Stents",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2013,22837311,['Spectroscopy'],1.9,Spectroscopy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.9,"['tissue-plasminogen activator', 'large-vessel', 'acute ischemic-stroke']",stroke
149,149,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Iterative reconstruction techniques facilitate CT dose reduction; though to our knowledge, no group has explored using iterative reconstruction with pediatric head CT. Our purpose was to perform a feasibility study to assess the use of ASIR in a small group of pediatric patients undergoing head CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Alderson-Rando head phantom was scanned at decreasing 10% mA intervals relative to our standard protocol, and each study was then reconstructed at 10% ASIR intervals. An intracranial region of interest was consistently placed to estimate noise. Our ventriculoperitoneal shunt CT protocol was subsequently modified, and patients were scanned at 20% ASIR with approximately 20% mA reductions. ASIR studies were anonymously compared with older non-ASIR studies from the same patients by 2 attending pediatric neuroradiologists for diagnostic utility, sharpness, noise, and artifacts. RESULTS: The phantom study demonstrated similar noise at 100% mA/0% ASIR (3.9) and 80% mA/20% ASIR (3.7). Twelve pediatric patients were scanned at reduced dose at 20% ASIR. The average CTDIvol and DLP values of the 20% ASIR studies were 22.4 mGy and 338.4 mGy-cm, and for the non-ASIR studies, they were 28.8 mGy and 444.5 mGy-cm, representing statistically significant decreases in the CTDIvol (22.1%, P =.00007) and DLP (23.9%, P =.0005) values. There were no significant differences between the ASIR studies and non-ASIR studies with respect to diagnostic acceptability, sharpness, noise, or artifacts.

In vivo device deformations and their impact on the porosity of the segment of device lying over the aneurysm neck remain inadequately characterized. Porosities of different braided FDs were studied in straight and 90A degrees curved glass tubes. In vivo, 11 experimental lateral wall aneurysms were treated with FD (n = 7) or HP (n = 4) stents. At 3 months, the segment of FDs and HP stents over the aneurysm neck was analyzed, paying attention to changes in device diameter, metallic porosity, and neointimal closure of pores over the aneurysm or branch ostia. Device deformations were reproduced with benchtop experiments. In 90A degrees curved tubes, FD porosity was higher (P = 0.025) and pore density was lower (P = 0.01) on convex compared to concave surfaces, but variations remained within 5-10 %. After in vivo deployment, a spindle-shaped deformation of FDs occurred, with focal expansion at the level of the aneurysm neck (P = 0.004). This deformation translated into an accordion-like distribution of stent struts across the aneurysm neck, where porosity was not uniform. The midsection of the aneurysm ostium had more metal coverage than adjacent ostial areas (P = 0.002). Mean porosity over the aneurysm neck was 78 A +/- 9.4 and 32.6 A +/- 12.1 % for HP and FD stents, respectively (P = 0.008), decreasing to 13.0 A +/- 10.1 and 1.4 A +/- 0.6 % (P = 0.022) following neointimal coverage, respectively.

In this paper, we report our experience with the Silk stent (SS) for endovascular treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms and present periprocedural events, immediate results, delayed complications, and imaging and clinical follow-up results. We retrospectively examined angiographic images and clinical reports of 76 consecutive patients with 87 intracranial aneurysms who were treated with SSs between March 2008 and June 2011. All aneurysms could be successfully covered technically using implanted SSs, with an overall mortality of 6.6 %. Two transient morbidities (2.6 %) and three permanent morbidities due to embolic events (3.9 %) were observed. Unexpected procedural technical events occurred in 18 procedures (18/78, 23.1 %). Control angiographies were performed in all 71 patients with 82 aneurysms (100 %). Mean angiographic follow-up time was 17.5 +/- 11.1 months [range 2-48 months]. Sixteen of the 71 patients with 19 aneurysms had only early angiographic controls in the first 6 months while remaining 55 patients with 63 aneurysms (77.5 %) had late controls after 6 months. Overall control angiographic occlusion rates were as follows: 87.8 % (72/82) total occlusion, 8.5 % residual aneurysm filling, and 3.7 % residual neck filling. The general in-stent stenosis rate in controls was 5.6 % and the stented parent artery occlusion rate was 4.2 %. Five (6.6 %) aneurysms ruptured after stent implantation in our series.

However, flow diverters have, to date, not been tested in direct comparison with other available treatments. We present a matched-pair comparison of paraclinoid aneurysms treated with the PED versus other endovascular techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one eligible patients with 22 paraclinoid aneurysms treated with the PED at our institution were matched with historic controls with aneurysms of similar size and location. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of aneurysm size, location, risk factors, or comorbidities. Mean dome size was 13.9 +/- 6.7 mm in the control group and 14.9 +/- 6.3 mm in the PED group (P = .52). Balloon and stent assistance were used in 31.8% and 9.1% of controls, respectively, while carotid sacrifice was used in 36.4% of the controls. There was a significant difference in the rate of complete occlusion favoring PED at radiologic follow-up (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Flow diverters achieve a much higher rate of complete angiographic obliteration compared with other standard endovascular techniques in the treatment of internal carotid artery aneurysms.

155,155,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-diverting devices are increasingly being considered for large or giant aneurysms with wide necks, which are difficult to treat with coils or clips. These devices are often oversized to achieve good positioning against the artery wall. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of oversized flow-diverting devices in altering aneurysmal flows and creating hemodynamic environments favorable for thrombosis and aneurysm occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models of 3 cerebral aneurysms were constructed from 3D angiography images. Numeric simulations of the hemodynamics after implanting stents of increasing diameters were performed. The corresponding modifications of hemodynamic variables such as aneurysm inflow rate, average velocity, shear rate, and wall shear stress were calculated and compared. RESULTS: The results indicate that because the devices are oversized, the stent cells stretch in the direction of the vessel axis, change cell angles, and result in larger cells. This change in the cell geometry causes a diminution of the hemodynamic performance of the stent. Quantitatively, stent oversizing results in larger values of aneurysm inflow rates, average velocity, shear rate, and wall shear stress compared with nonoversizing cases. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of flow-diverting devices in modifying intra-aneurysmal flow can be substantially reduced by oversizing the devices. As the level of device oversize increases, aneurysmal hemodynamic variables are significantly less affected.",Effects of Flow-Diverting Device Oversizing on Hemodynamics Alteration in Cerebral Aneurysms,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2012,22555581,['Angiography'],1.91,Angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.91,"['intracranial aneurysms', 'stent', 'experience', 'reconstruction', 'pipeline']",aneurysms

Improved segmentation and registration have been demonstrated by WM LI before segmentation. DARTEL appears to improve registration versus the USM. Our aim was to compare the performance of VBM-DARTEL versus VBM-USM and the effect of LI in the regional analysis of GM atrophy in MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3T T1 MR imaging scans were acquired from 26 patients with RRMS and 28 age-matched NC. LI replaced WM lesions with normal-appearing WM intensities before image segmentation. VBM analysis was performed in SPM8 by using DARTEL and USM with and without LI, allowing the comparison of 4 VBM methods (DARTEL + LI, DARTEL - LI, USM + LI, and USM - LI). Accuracy of VBM was assessed by using NMI, CC, and a simulation analysis. RESULTS: Overall, DARTEL + LI yielded the most accurate GM maps among the 4 methods (highest NMI and CC, P < .001). DARTEL + LI showed significant GM loss in the bilateral thalami and caudate nuclei in patients with RRMS versus NC. The other 3 methods overestimated the number of regions of GM loss in RRMS versus NC. LI improved the accuracy of both VBM methods. Simulated data suggested the accuracy of the results provided from patient MR imaging analysis.

158,158,"The clinical differentiation of Parkinson's disease (PD) from multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may be challenging, especially in their early stages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurement to distinguish among these degenerative disorders. Twenty-five MSA, 20 PSP, and 17 PD patients and 18 healthy controls were retrospectively studied. Axial diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted images were obtained using a 3-T MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were precisely placed in the midbrain, pons, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, thalamus, superior cerebellar peduncle, middle cerebellar peduncle, cerebellar white matter, and cerebellar dentate nucleus, and the regional ADC (rADC) value was calculated in each ROI. In MSA, rADC values in the pons, middle cerebellar peduncle, cerebellar white matter, and cerebellar dentate nucleus were significantly higher than in PSP, PD, and controls. Furthermore, rADC values in the posterior putamen were significantly higher in MSA than in PSP and controls. In PSP, rADC values were significantly higher in the globus pallidus and midbrain than in MSA, PD, and controls. Furthermore, rADC values in the caudate nucleus and superior cerebellar peduncle were significantly higher in PSP than in MSA and controls. In PD, there were no significant differences in the rADC values compared to in MSA, PSP, and controls in all regions. Evaluation of rADC values in characteristic lesions in MSA, PSP, and PD by placing ROIs using 3-T systems can provide useful additional information for differentiating these disorders.","Significance of apparent diffusion coefficient measurement for the differential diagnosis of multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Parkinson's disease: evaluation by 3.0-T MR imaging",NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2012,22274571,['DTI'],2.369668246,DTI,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.369668246,"['multiple system atrophy', 'msa', 'variant', '3.0 t', 'cbd', 'psp', 'criteria', 'degeneration', 'apparent diffusion coefficient', 'pd', 'subtypes']",athrophy

160,160,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disease affecting both WM and GM. While WM lesions are easily visualized by conventional MR imaging, the detection of GM alterations remains challenging. This diffusion tensor MR imaging study aimed to detect and characterize diffuse microscopic alterations in 2 deep GM structures, the caudate nucleus and the thalamus, in patients with RR and SP MS. The relationship between diffusivity markers, and atrophy of the caudate and the thalamus, as well as brain lesion load and clinical status of the patients was also explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three RR and 18 SP patients, along with 27 healthy controls, underwent MR imaging examination including anatomic and DTI acquisitions. Volumes, mean FA, and MD of the caudate and the thalamus, as well as WM lesion volumes, were assessed. RESULTS: FA was significantly (P < .001) increased in the caudate and the thalamus of patients with MS compared with controls, and was higher in SP compared with RR patients. Increased FA was associated with volume decreases of caudate (r = -0.712; P < .0011 and thalamus (r = 0.407; P < .011 in patients with MS.

161,161,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious disease typically occurring in the brain whose diagnosis and efficacy of treatment monitoring are vital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently used in serial brain imaging due to the rich and detailed information provided. Time-series analysis of images is widely used for MS diagnosis and patient follow-up. However, conventional manual methods are time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Thus, the development of automated techniques for the detection and quantification of MS lesions is a major challenge. This paper presents an up-to-date review of the approaches which deal with the time-series analysis of brain MRI for detecting active MS lesions and quantifying lesion load change. We provide a comprehensive reference source for researchers in which several approaches to change detection and quantification of MS lesions are investigated and classified. We also analyze the results provided by the approaches, discuss open problems, and point out possible future trends. Lesion detection approaches are required for the detection of static lesions and for diagnostic purposes, while either quantification of detected lesions or change detection algorithms are needed to follow up MS patients. However, there is not yet a single approach that can emerge as a standard for the clinical practice, automatically providing an accurate MS lesion evolution quantification. Future trends will focus on combining the lesion detection in single studies with the analysis of the change detection in serial MRI.",Automated detection of multiple sclerosis lesions in serial brain MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2012,22179659,['MRI'],1.974723539,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,1.974723539,"['review', 'serial analysis', 'white-matter lesions', 'multiple sclerosis', 'quantitative follow-up', 'mri', 'computer-aided diagnosis']",wm

For each participant, four volumes were measured (C2-3 volume, cervical cord volume, thoracic cord volume, and whole cord volume). The volumes were normalized by the number of slices and three potential measures of body size (intracranial volume [ICV], body mass index, and body surface area) using the proportional method. RESULTS All raw volumes and volumes normalized by number of slices or ICV were significantly lower in progressive MS patients compared to relapsing MS patients/healthy controls (P < .05). In addition, C2-3 volume and cervical cord volume were significantly correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale score (P < .05). All regional volumes showed high intercorrelation, and normalization by the number of slices significantly increased some correlations. Regarding reliability, whole cord volume regardless of normalization technique had lower coefficient of variation than C2-3 volume.

We tested whether each permutation reduced bias and variance of the Gd/MION rCBV differences by using generalized estimating equations and Fmax statistics (P < .05 significant).

166,166,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identification of ICH, particularly after ischemic stroke therapy, is important for guiding subsequent antithrombotic management and is often confounded by contrast staining or extravasations within intracerebral or extra-axial compartments. This study evaluates the accuracy of DECT in distinguishing ICH from iodinated contrast in patients who received contrast via IA or IV delivery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients who had received IA or IV contrast were evaluated using a DECT scanner at 80kV and 140kV to distinguish hyperdensities secondary to contrast staining or extravasation from those representing ICH. A 3-material decomposition algorithm was used to obtain virtual noncontrast images and iodine overlay images. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of DECT in prospectively distinguishing intracranial contrast from hemorrhage within parenchymal, subarachnoid, extra-axial, intraventricular, and intra-arterial compartments were computed using routine clinical follow-up imaging as the standard of reference. RESULTS: A total of 148 foci of intracranial hyperattenuation were identified. Of these, 142 were correctly classified for the presence of hemorrhage by DECT. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying hemorrhage, depending on the compartment being considered, were 100%, 84.4%- 100%, and 87.2%-100%, respectively. The only instances where DECT failed to correctly identify the source of hyperattenuation was in the presence of diffuse parenchymal calcification (n = 5) and a metallic streak artifact (n = 1). CONCLUSION: After IA and/or IV contrast administration, DECT can accurately differentiate all types of ICH from iodinated contrast without employing any additional radiation.",Differentiation of Hemorrhage from Iodinated Contrast in Different Intracranial Compartments Using Dual-Energy Head CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2012,22268092,['CT'],2.09,CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.09,"['intracerebral hemorrhage', 'intraarterial thrombolysis']",hemorrhage
167,167,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PRES-related vasogenic edema is potentially reversible while hemorrhage occurs in only 15.2%-17.3% of patients. However, the true incidence of hemorrhage could be higher when SWI is considered. Thus, we set out to determine the incidence of MH, SAH, and IPH in PRES by using SWI and to particularly evaluate whether such MHs are reversible. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with PRES and SWI were included, 17 having follow-up SWI. Two neuroradiologists reviewed SWI, FLAIR, DWI, and CE-T1WI. The presence and number of MHs (< 5 mm) on SWI, SAH, and IPH (> 5 mm) were recorded at presentation and follow-up. We evaluated associations between the presence of MH on SWI and DWI lesions, SAH, IPH, contrast enhancement, and MR imaging severity. RESULTS: Hemorrhage was present in 20/31 patients (64.5%), with MHs on SWI in 18/31 (58.1%) at presentation and in 11/17 (64.7%) at follow-up. SAH was present in 3/31 on SWI and 4/31 on FLAIR, while 2/31 had IPH. At follow-up, no patients had acquired new MHs; 2/5 MHs in 1 patient resolved.

No association was found between the presence of MHs on SWI and DWI, SAH, IPH, enhancement, and MR imaging severity (all P > .05).

However, before resting-state fMRI can be applied for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment for an individual patient with neurologic or psychiatric diseases, it is essential to assess its long-term reproducibility and between-subject variations among healthy individuals. The purpose of the study was to quantify the long-term test-retest reproducibility of ICN measures derived from resting-state fMRI and to assess the between-subject variation of ICN measures across the whole brain.

170,170,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI is increasingly being used as a measure to study tissue damage in several neurologic diseases. Our aim was to investigate the comparability of DTI measures between different MR imaging magnets and platforms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two healthy volunteers underwent DTI on five 31 MR imaging scanners (3 Trios and 2 Signas) by using a matched 33 noncollinear diffusion-direction pulse sequence. Within each subject, a total of 16 white matter (corpus callosum, periventricular, and deep white matter) and gray matter (cortical and deep gray) ROIs were drawn on a single image set and then were coregistered to the other images. Mean FA, ADC, and longitudinal and transverse diffusivities were calculated within each ROI. Concordance correlations were derived by comparing ROI DTI values among each of the 5 magnets. RESULTS: Mean concordance for FA was 0.96; for both longitudinal and transverse diffusivities, it was 0.93; and for ADC, it was 0.88. Mean scan-rescan concordance was 0.96-0.97 for all DTI measures. Concordance correlations within platforms were, in general, better than those between platforms for all DTI measures (mean concordance of 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a 3T magnet and high-angular-resolution pulse sequence yielded comparable DTI measurements across different MR imaging magnets and platforms. Our results indicate that FA is the most comparable measure across magnets, followed by individual diffusivities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-two patients with histopathologically confirmed diffuse gliomas underwent DWI and DSC. Mean rCBV and ADC values were compared among the tumor groups with the Student t test or ANOVA. ROC analysis was used to determine rCBV and ADC threshold values for glioma grading. RESULTS: rCBV had significantly different values between grade II and IV gliomas and between grade III and IV tumors, but there were no significant differences between grade II and III gliomas (P > .05). Grade II and III tumors also did not differ when astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas were considered separately. ADC values were significantly different for all 3 grades.

METHODS WM lesions were identified and quantified on a single magnetic resonance imaging scan from 1,249 patients with MS. The spatial distribution of lesions was compared between early RR, late RR, and SP MS in the context of normal cerebral perfusion patterns provided by a single-photon emission-computed tomography atlas of healthy individuals. RESULTS Patients with SP MS had more distinct and larger lesions than patients with RR MS. Across all subjects, lesions were present in regions of relatively lower normal perfusion than normal appearing WM. Further, lesions in SP MS were more common in areas of lower perfusion as compared to the lesion distribution in early and late RR MS. CONCLUSION Chronic plaques were more prevalent in WM regions with lower relative perfusion.

173,173,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wide-neck bifurcating aneurysms are increasingly treated with intracranial stent-assisted coiling by using shape-memory alloy microstents. We sought to investigate the short- and long-term effects of intracranial stent implantation on the geometry and angular conformation of the stent-coiled vascular bifurcation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent stent-mediated coiling for 31 bifurcation aneurysms by using 31 self-expanding Neuroform (n = 14) and Enterprise In = 17) stents (17 women; mean age, 56 years). The angle (delta) between the stented mother and daughter vessels at the bifurcation was measured by using multiplanar imaging of reconstructed rotational conventional angiography volumes and was compared by using matched-pair statistics. Neuroform and Enterprise longitudinal stent stiffness was measured in vitro at an increasing bending angle theta (theta = 180 degrees - delta). RESULTS: Stent deployment increased the bifurcation angle delta from 101.5 degrees to 119.8 degrees postprocedurally and to 137.3 degrees (P < .0001) at latest follow-up, resulting in effective straightening; the angular remodeling was greater in distal-versus-proximal arteries (anterior cerebral > MCA > BA > ICA), inversely proportional to mother-vessel diameter and proportional to pretreatment bending angle theta. At follow-up, angle delta continued to significantly expand, with remodeling being greater in the early period (1-6 versus > 7 months) and more pronounced with the longitudinally stiffer closed-cell Enterprise compared with the open-cell Neuroform stent. CONCLUSIONS: Stent placement across bifurcation aneurysms leads to a significant biphasic angular remodeling related to stent type and vessel caliber, altering morphology to mimic sidewall lesions, a phenomenon needing consideration during procedural planning.

After that, all patients underwent follow-up angiography within 36 hours of the initiation of IV thrombolysis. Aneurysm-related hemorrhage was defined as a hemorrhage that was related to the aneurysm site. RESULTS A total of 201 patients were analyzed, and 8 (4.1%) had unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Of the 8 patients, 4 had aneurysms over 5 mm of the longest diameter. Three patients had intracerebral hemorrhage that developed at the site of infarction, which was unrelated to the aneurysms. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that IV thrombolysis might not increase the risk of aneurysmal bleeding in acute stroke patients with unruptured aneurysm < 10 mm in diameter. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm our result.",Detection and Significance of Incidental Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysms in Patients Undergoing Intravenous Thrombolysis for Acute Ischemic Stroke,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2012,21143548,"['Angiography', 'CT']",1.893491124,CT,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,1.893491124,"['intracranial aneurysms', 'thrombolysis', 'unruptured cerebral aneurysm', 'rupture', 'acute ischemic stroke', 'hemorrhage', 'risks']",aneurysms
176,176,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 4D-CT is a novel method of multiphase CT imaging. When used to localize parathyroid adenomas and hyperplasia, this technique may allow for more robust diagnostic accuracy than traditional sonography and nuclear scintigraphy techniques. The purpose of our study is to assess the accuracy of 4D-CT for localizing pathologically proved parathyroid adenomas and hyperplasia found during surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 pathologically proved cases of parathyroid adenoma and hyperplasia were retrospectively reviewed between January 2009 and March 2011. Inclusion criteria were availability of final surgical pathology and performance of preoperative 4D-CT. No cases were excluded. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 4D-CT were ascertained including both the side and quadrant of the pathologically proved lesion. RESULTS: Of the 35 pathologically proved cases collected over the study period, 32 (sensitivity = 91%) patients were found positive for parathyroid disease using 4D-CT, including 3 cases of rnultigland disease. For lateralization of single-gland disease, 4D-CT demonstrated an accuracy of 93%. 4D-CT revealed a suboptimal 44% sensitivity, but 100% specificity, for multigland disease. CONCLUSIONS: 4D-CT demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy for single and multigland disease in our cohort. Importantly, 4D-CT accurately lateralized single-gland adenomas in >90% of cases, allowing the surgeon to employ a directed operative approach. 4D-CT also showed a very high specificity for the detection of multigland disease.",Diagnostic Accuracy of 4D-CT for Parathyroid Adenomas and Hyperplasia,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2012,22135127,['CT'],1.97,CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.97,"['4-dimensional computed-tomography', 'minimally invasive parathyroidectomy']",stroke

We report the procedural safety and clinical outcomes in a prospective randomized controlled trial of endovascular coiling for ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms, comparing polymer-loaded Cerecyte coils with bare platinum coils in 23 centers worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred patients between 18 and 70 years of age with a ruptured or unruptured target aneurysm planning to undergo endovascular coiling were randomized to receive Cerecyte or bare platinum coils. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-nine patients were allocated to Cerecyte coils and 251 to bare platinum coils. Baseline characteristics were balanced. For ruptured aneurysms, in-hospital mortality was 2/114 (1.8%) with Cerecyte versus 0/119 (0%) bare platinum coils. There were 8 (3.4%) adverse procedural events resulting in neurological deterioration: 5/114 (4.4%) with Cerecyte versus 3/119 (2.5%) with bare platinum coils (P = .22). The 6-month mRS score of <= 2 was not significantly different in 103/109 (94.5%) patients with Cerecyte and 110/112 (98.2%) patients with bare platinum coils. Poor outcome (mRS score of >= 3 or death) was 6/109 (5.5%) with Cerecyte versus 2/112 (1.8%) with bare platinum coils (P = .0701. For UlAs, there was no in-hospital mortality. There were 7 (2.7%) adverse procedural events with neurological deterioration, 5/133 (3.8%) with Cerecyte versus 2/131 (1.5%) with bare platinum coils (P = .13). There was a 6-month mRS score of <= 2 in 114/119 (95.8%) patients with Cerecyte versus 123/123 (100%) patients with bare platinum coils. There was poor outcome (mRS >= 3 and 1 death) in 5/119 (4.2%) patients with Cerecyte versus 0/123 (0%) patients with bare platinum coils (P = .011).

The purpose of our research was to report the long-term angiographic and cross-sectional imaging results after placement of a PED in 12 patients with wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve wide-neck or otherwise untreatable cerebral aneurysms in 12 patients were treated with the PED. Angiography was performed at 6 and 24 months after treatment. Additional MR and CT angiograms were acquired. RESULTS: In all patients, angiographic or cross-sectional imaging follow-up of at least 27 months demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysms treated with the PED. There were no cases of aneurysm recurrence. Angiography at around 6 months showed complete occlusion in all cases, except 1 that showed complete occlusion at the 29-month follow-up. In 1 patient, a clinically asymptomatic 75% in-stent stenosis was seen on the angiography at 6 months but was resolved completely by balloon dilation. Device placement was successful in all patients. Distal embolization had occurred in 1 patient, but the clot was resolved completely without clinical seguelae. Almost immediate angiographic occlusion was achieved in 2 aneurysms and flow reduction in 10 aneurysms.

CTP was postprocessed with commercial software packages, using standard and delay-corrected deconvolution algorithms. Relative cerebral blood flow, volume, and mean transit time (rCBF, rCBV and rMTT) values were obtained by normalization to the uninvolved hemisphere.

183,183,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The purpose of our study was aimed to analyze the sex-and age-related differences of brain metabolism in healthy individuals. METHODS Consecutive 100 healthy subjects, 50 males and 50 females, undergoing routine 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) for health checkup in our hospital were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used for analyses of the FDG PET images to disclose the possible effects of age on brain metabolism in males and females as well as the differences of brain metabolism between male and female groups. RESULTS In males and females, decreased brain metabolism with aging is found in bilateral lateral orbital prefrontal and right anterior cingulate cortices. In comparisons between sexes, males are found to have more brain metabolism than females in bilateral visual cortices and cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS Our report discloses different sex-and age-related brain metabolism. Decreased brain metabolism with aging in males and females is similar to findings reported in previous literatures. However, whether declined brain function or volume with aging causing metabolic changes is unknown and should be further evaluated. Nevertheless, the sex-related differences are possibly compatible with the historical observation of better performance in visual-spatial tasks in males than females.",Sex- and Age-Related Differences in Brain FDG Metabolism of Healthy Adults: An SPM Analysis,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2012,21332873,['PET'],2.24852071,PET,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.24852071,"['2-[18f]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography', 'brain', 'cerebral glucose-metabolism', 'dementia']",dementia

The DSC-MR imaging measure of rCBV offers the advantages of speed and convenience to overcome these limitations; however, clinical use of this technique depends on establishing accurate correlations between rCBV, MVA, and MVD, particularly in the setting of heterogeneous vascular size inherent to human HGG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained preoperative 31 DSC-MR imaging in patients with HGG before stereotactic surgery. We histologically quantified MVA, MVD, and vascular size heterogeneity from CD34-stained 10-mu m sections of stereotactic biopsies, and we coregistered biopsy locations with localized rCBV measurements. We statistically correlated rCBV, MVA, and MVD under conditions of high and low vascular-size heterogeneity and among tumor grades. We correlated all parameters with OS by using Cox regression. RESULTS: We analyzed 38 biopsies from 24 subjects. rCBV correlated strongly with MVA (r = 0.83, P < .0001) but weakly with MVD (r = 0.32, P = .051, due to microvessel size heterogeneity.

We aimed to elucidate the cerebral white matter alteration in patients with iNPH by using DTI and to test the accuracy of TBSS analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI data were obtained from 20 patients with iNPH and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. The FA values were evaluated by using TBSS, region-of-interest and tract-specific analysis of the CST. The accuracy of TBSS analysis was tested by using ""back-projection"" of TBSS results and by comparing the TBSS analysis results with those of region-of-interest and tract-specific analysis. RESULTS: Back-projection of the TBSS results showed accurate registration of the whole brain, with the exception of parts of the thalamus, fornix, and white matter around the posterior body of the lateral ventricle. The TBSS analysis results were consistent with those of the region-of-interest analysis and tract-specific analysis. In patients with iNPH compared with control subjects, the FA values were significantly decreased in parts of the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, and juxtacortical white matter in the frontal and parietal lobes. In contrast, FA values were significantly increased in the internal capsule, extending to the white matter in the centrum semiovale.

188,188,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI provides a sensitive measure of change in the microstructure of white matter integrity. The purpose of our study was to investigate age-related changes, sex differences, and age-by-sex interactions in white matter integrity (FA, AD, and RD) across the whole brain with a large sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 857 healthy subjects (mean age = 56.1 +/- 9.9 years; age range = 24.9-84.8 years) were included in this study. All subjects were scanned at 3T. With use of TBSS, we examined the effects of age and sex on FA, AD, and RD in the white matter. RESULTS: Global FA was negatively correlated with age (R-2 = 0.18, P < .0001), and global AD and RD were positively correlated with age (AD: R-2 = 0.02, P < .0001; RD: R-2 = 0.19, P < .0001). The correlation between age and global AD, however, was weak. Voxelwise analysis revealed a number of regions where FA was negatively correlated with age, with most of these regions showing a significant positive correlation between RD and age. There was a significant age-related FA increase in several white matter regions. Voxelwise analysis also revealed many regions where FA, AD, or RD differed between men and women; however, no region showed a significant interaction between age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that age-related changes in white matter integrity are more strongly associated with myelin sheath degeneration than with axonal degeneration, and that, in some specific regions, the number of remyelinated axons might increase with age.

We hypothesized that greater degrees of recanalization would be associated with a higher likelihood of favorable functional outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from MERCI and Multi MERCI prospective single-arm trials of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke were pooled. The TIMI score was used to define the degree of recanalization, and a favorable outcome was defined as an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were included. Age, stroke severity, and site of arterial occlusion did not differ among groups stratified by the TIMI score. The unadjusted OR for a favorable outcome increased significantly as the TIMI score increased from 0 to 1 (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.7-20.0; P = .007) and from 2 to 3 (OR. 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.5; P = .011 and the likelihood of death decreased significantly as the TIMI score increased from 2 to 3 (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.3; P = .05). In multivariate analysis, each increase in TIMI grade increased the odds of a good outcome 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.9-3.4, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in the TIMI score were highly associated with improved outcomes.

In recent years. CFD technology has been recognized as a potential risk-analysis tool. The aim of this article was to propose a hemodynamic parameter, EL, to determine the effects of stable unruptured aneurysms and of those that ruptured during the subsequent observation period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four incidentally found ICA-PcomA aneurysms ruptured during the period of observation (ruptured-IAs). Another 26 unruptured aneurysms (stable-IAs) with similar location, size, and morphology were compared for the differences in hemodynamic factors, such as EL and WSS. RESULTS: The EL calculated at the ruptured-IAs was nearly 5 times higher on average than that at the stable-IAs (ruptured, 0.00374 +/- 0.0011; stable, 0.000745 +/- 0.0001 mW/mm(3), P < .001). However, there was no difference between the ruptured and stable groups according to the results of time-averaged WSS (P = .8) for ruptured- and stable-IAs. According to flow visualization, though the mean average inflow speed of ruptured-IAs was 2 times higher than that of the stable-IAs, the flow inside ruptured-IAs appeared to undergo longer resident tracks, with stronger impact on the aneurysm wall. On the contrary, the flow inside stable-IAs passed smoothly through the aneurysms.

DT MR imaging is sensitive to microstructural changes occurring in WM tracts of patients with ALS. In this study, we investigated the association between cognitive functions and extramotor WM tract abnormalities in ALS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DT MR imaging was obtained from 16 nondemented patients with ALS and 15 healthy controls. Patients with ALS underwent a neuropsychologic and behavioral evaluation. DT tractography was used to asses the integrity of the CST, corpus callosum, and the major long-range association tracts. The relationship between DT MR imaging metrics and cognitive functions was tested by using linear model analyses, adjusting for age and clinical disability. RESULTS: Eleven patients (69%) scored below the fifth percentile in at least 1 cognitive test, and 2 of them had a mild executive impairment. Performances at tests assessing attention and executive functions correlated with DT MR imaging metrics of the corpus callosum, CST, and long association WM tracts bilaterally, including the cingulum, inferior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital, and uncinate fasciculi. Verbal learning and memory test scores were associated with fornix DT MR imaging values, whereas visual-spatial abilities correlated with left uncinate fractional anisotropy.

We postulated that some hippocampus subfields are specifically atrophic in aMCI and that measuring hippocampus subfield volumes will improve sensitivity of MR imaging to detect aMCI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated episodic memory and hippocampus subfield volume in 15 patients with aMCI and 15 matched controls. After segmentation of the whole hippocampus from clinical MR imaging, we applied a new computational method allowing fully automated segmentation of the hippocampus subfields. This method used a Bayesian modeling approach to infer segmentations from the imaging data. RESULTS: In comparison with controls, subiculum and CA2-3 were significantly atrophic in patients with aMCI, whereas total hippocampus volume and other subfields were not. Total hippocampus volume in controls was age-related, whereas episodic memory was the main explanatory variable for both the total hippocampus volume and the subfields that were atrophic in patients with aMCI.

To determine whether stents affect long-term outcomes after coiling of unruptured aneurysms, we compared angiographic outcomes at 2 years postembolization for stent- and nonstent-assisted coiled unruptured aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stent-assisted coiling was used in unruptured aneurysms unfavorable for simple coiling (neck size >4 mm and dome-to-neck ratio <1.5) in our practice. Therefore, 126 coiled unruptured aneurysms in total (40 [31.7%] stent group and 86 [68.3%] nonstent group) with these conditions were selected for this study. The nonstent group aneurysms were treated with multiple microcatheter technique (53 cases) or balloon-assisted technique (33 cases). Self-expandable stents were used for coiling in stent group aneurysms. No significant difference in aneurysmal characteristics (aneurysm type [sidewall/bifurcation], diameter, neck size, and dome-to-neck ratio) or angiographic outcome at embolization (packing attenuation, obliteration grade, and contrast filling) were observed between the 2 study groups. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up visits, rates of progressive occlusion (stent group, 17/40 [42.5%] versus nonstent group, 34/86 [39.5%]) and recanalization (7/40 [17.5%] versus 18/86 [21.0%]) did not show a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .895). CONCLUSIONS: The present study did not show that additional hemodynamic and biologic effects of stents designed for neck remodeling were enough to enhance progressive occlusion and prevent the recanalization of unruptured aneurysms.

196,196,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Patients with small vessel disease show high-signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images that represent ischemic cell damage. However, despite a similar degree of ischemic change, the amount and the severity of clinical presentations may vary. We investigated the clinical correlations of ischemic changes using voxel-based morphometric analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS Twenty-seven MCI and 34 dementia patients were included who all had significant small vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all patients, neuropsychological tests, a rating on the Pyramidal and Extrapyramidal scale (PEPS) for motor deficits, and 3-Tesla MRI including DTI scans were performed. Voxel-based analysis of the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were computed. RESULTS Cognitive scores correlated with the DTI abnormalities in supratentorial areas with regional specificity according to each cognitive test.

However, despite a similar degree of ischemic change, the amount and the severity of clinical presentations may vary. We investigated the clinical correlations of ischemic changes using voxel-based morphometric analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS Twenty-seven MCI and 34 dementia patients were included who all had significant small vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all patients, neuropsychological tests, a rating on the Pyramidal and Extrapyramidal scale (PEPS) for motor deficits, and 3-Tesla MRI including DTI scans were performed. Voxel-based analysis of the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were computed. RESULTS Cognitive scores correlated with the DTI abnormalities in supratentorial areas with regional specificity according to each cognitive test. Unexpectedly, cognitive deficits in most neuropsychological tests, even in some frontal tasks, were associated with disruption of posterior white matter integrities.

However, C-arms rotate slower than clinical CT scanners, making CTP challenging. We developed a cerebral CTP protocol for C-arm CBCT and evaluated it in an animal study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five anesthetized swine were imaged by using C-arm CBCT and conventional CT. The C-arm rotates in 4.3 seconds plus a 1.25-second turnaround, compared with 0.5 seconds for clinical CT. Each C-arm scan had 6 continuous bidirectional sweeps. Multiple scans each with a different delay to the start of an aortic arch iodinated contrast injection and a novel image reconstruction algorithm were used to increase temporal resolution. Three different scan sets (consisting of 6, 3, or 2 scans) and 3 injection protocols (3-mL/s 100%, 3-mL/s 67%, and 6-mL/s 50% contrast concentration) were studied.

200,200,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent-assisted endovascular treatment and flow diversion techniques are increasingly used for the management of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. We report our initial clinical experience using a new flow diversion technique for the endovascular management of bifurcation aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight bifurcation aneurysms were treated by placing 2 stents in Y-configuration with no accompanying endosaccular packing. This treatment technique aimed at flow diversion was selected in these cases because 1 I the aneurysm was giant and causing mass effect, 21 the emanating branches were incorporated within the sac, or 3) the aneurysm was too small. Aneurysms were located at middle cerebral 15 aneurysms) and basilar artery bifurcations (3 aneurysms). Five aneurysms were small, 1 was large, and 2 were partially thrombosed giant. Closed-cell stents were used in all Y-stent placement procedures RESULTS: In all aneurysms, both stents could be placed at the intended locations without any procedural complication. Follow-up angiograms obtained at 3 months to 2 years demonstrated that all stents were patent except for one with asymptomatic P1 occlusion. Complete occlusion with remodelled bifurcation was observed in all middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysms and the large basilar tip aneurysm. Residual filling despite reduction in size was observed in both of the partially thrombosed giant aneurysms at 2-year and 3-month follow-up angiograms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Flow diversion with double stent placement in Y-configuration provided successful and stable aneurysm occlusion.

202,202,"Flow diverter (FD) devices have emerged as an alternative treatment for a subgroup of intracranial aneurysms. The principle of endovascular flow diversion is inherently different from endosaccular coil embolisation. To monitor the angiographic outcomes for FDs, a sensitive and reliable new measure is required. Oxford Neurovascular and Neuroradiology Research Unit developed a grading schema while conducting a registry to audit outcomes of patients treated using a particular FD (SILK flow diverter; Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France). The aim of this study is to assess the applicability and reproducibility of the new schema. The proposed grading schema is designed for saccular- or fusiform-shaped aneurysms. For both, it documents the degree of aneurysm occlusion using a five-point scale and the parent artery patency on a three-point scale. Two neuroradiologists used the schema to independently rate 55 angiograms showing comparable treatment and follow-up angiograms of patients treated with a FD. Inter-observer agreement was estimated using the weighted kappa co-efficient. Both readers found the schema easy to apply. Overall, there were ten discordant readings for degrees of aneurysm occlusion and two for parent artery patency. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for both the assessment of aneurysm occlusion (k=0.89; C.I.=0.81-0.99) and parent artery patency (k=0.90; C.I.=0.76-1.0). The proposed schema is sufficiently sensitive to register gradual aneurysm occlusion and parent artery patency on interval angiograms. It is reproducible and is applicable to both saccular and fusiform aneurysms. More data on follow-up of FD-treated aneurysms is needed to prove its efficacy in predicting the long-term behaviour of treated aneurysms.",Assessment of angiographic outcomes after flow diversion treatment of intracranial aneurysms: a new grading schema,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2011,20838782,['angiography'],2.594995366,angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.594995366,"['endovascular treatment', 'embolization', 'flow diverter', 'embolisation', 'intracranial aneurysm', 'cerebral aneurysms', 'angiogram', 'follow-up']",aneurysms

However, long-term medication and the chronicity of the disorder may have contributed substantially to these alterations. Studies examining patients in the early stages of the disorder reduce the possibility of such confounding factors but are rare. In light of this, the aim of the present study was to examine adolescents in the early stages of the disorder to observe primary structural brain abnormalities. METHODS Gray and white matter were measured in 13 adolescents with schizophrenia and 13 healthy controls matched for age, gender, handedness, and school type using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS Subjects with schizophrenia displayed decreased gray matter in the cerebellar vermis, and alterations in the left putamen and in several parts of the visual system.

This study aims to compare the visualization of microbleeds with 3D T2*-weighted imaging at 1.5T with 3D dual-echo T2*-weighted imaging at 7T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients (29 male; mean age, 58 +/- 12 years) with atherosclerotic disease from the Second Manifestations of ARTerial Disease study were included. 3D T2*-weighted imaging at 1.5T and dual-echo T2*-weighted imaging at 7T were done in all patients. The presence and number of definite microbleeds were recorded on minimal intensity projections. Inter- and intraobserver reliability was assessed with Cohen kappa test and the ICC. The difference in presence and number of microbleeds was tested with the McNemar test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The interobserver ICC at 7T was 0.61 and the intraobserver ICC was 0.94, whereas at 1.5T the interobserver ICC was 0.50 and the intraobserver ICC was 0.59. Microbleeds were detected in significantly more patients on 7T (50%) than on 1.5T scans (21%) (P = .001).

205,205,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early prediction of motor outcome is of interest in stroke management. We aimed to determine whether lesion location at DTT is predictive of motor outcome after acute stroke and whether this information improves the predictive accuracy of the clinical scores. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 60 consecutive patients within 12 hours of middle cerebral artery stroke onset. We used DTT to evaluate CST involvement in the motor cortex and premotor cortex, centrum semiovale, corona radiate, and PLIC and in combinations of these regions at admission, at day 3, and at day 30. Severity of limb weakness was assessed by using the motor subindex scores of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (5a, 5b, 6a, 6b). We calculated volumes of infarct and fractional anisotropy values in the CST of the pons. RESULTS: Acute damage to the PLIC was the best predictor associated with poor motor outcome, axonal damage, and clinical severity at admission (P <.001). There was no significant correlation between acute infarct volume and motor outcome at day 90 (P = .176, r = 0.485). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of acute CST involvement at the level of the PLIC for motor outcome at day 90 were 73.7%, 100%, 100%, and 89.1%, respectively. In the acute stage, DTT predicted motor outcome at day 90 better than the clinical scores (R(2) = 75.50, F = 80.09, P < .001).

Voxel-wise distributions of GM, WM damage, and T2 lesions were compared between patients with fatigued and nonfatigued MS by using SPM5 software. We report results at P < .05, FWE corrected. RESULTS: T2 lesion distribution and regional WM atrophy did not differ between patients with fatigued and nonfatigued MS.

208,208,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Olfactory dysfunction is commonly associated with IPD. We here report the association of OB volume and OS depth with olfactory function in patients with PD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morphometric analyses by using MR imaging and the Japanese T&T olfactometer threshold test were used to evaluate olfactory structure and function in 29 patients with PD and 29 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The olfactory recognition thresholds were significantly higher in patients with PD than in healthy controls (3.82 +/- 1.25 versus 0.45 +/- 0.65, P<.001). Olfactory atrophy with reductions in the volume of the OB (37.30 +/- 10.23 mm(3) versus 44.87 +/- 11.84 mm(3), P<.05) and in the depth of OS (8.90 +/- 1.42 mm versus 9.67 +/- 1.24 mm, P<.05) was observed in patients with PD but not in controls. Positive correlations between olfactory performance and OB volumes were observed in both patients with PD (r=0.45, P<.0001) and in controls (r=0.42, P<.0001). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the depth of OS and olfactory function in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that early olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD may be a primary consequence of damage to the OB.

209,209,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: dVRS have been previously associated with aging and cerebrovascular diseases. However, little is known about their prevalence and topographic distribution in the general elderly population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: dVRS were evaluated by using high-resolution 3D MR imaging in 1826 subjects enrolled in the 3C-Dijon MR imaging study. On T1-weighted MR imaging, dVRS were detected according to 3D imaging criteria and rated by using 4-level severity scores based in the BG or in the WM. The number and anatomic location of large dVRS (>= 3 mm) were recorded. RESULTS: dVRS were observed in the BG or WM in every subject. The severity of dVRS was significantly associated with higher age in both the BG and WM, whereas sex was related to the severity of dVRS only in the BG. Large dVRS were detected in 33.2% of participants. Status cribrosum was found in 1.3% of participants. dVRS were also highly prevalent within the hippocampus (44.5%) and hypothalamus (11.6%). CONCLUSIONS: dVRS are always detected in the BG or WM in elderly people, and large dVRS are also prevalent.

210,210,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: BBA is a rare type of intracranial aneurysm that is difficult to treat both surgically and endovascularly and is often associated with a high degree of morbidity/mortality. The aim of this study was to present clinical and angiographic results, as well as antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimens, of endovascular BBA treatment by using predominantly stent-assisted coil embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients (men/women, 6/7; mean age, 49.3 years) with ruptured BBAs were included from 2 different institutions. Angiographic findings, treatment strategies, anticoagulation/antiplatelet protocols, and clinical (mRS) and angiographic outcome were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Eleven BBAs were located in the supraclinoid ICA, and 2 on the basilar artery trunk. Nine of 13 were <= 3 mm in the largest diameter, and 8/13 showed early growth before treatment. Primary stent-assisted coiling was performed in 11/13 patients, double stents and PAD in 1 patient, each. Early complementary treatment was required in 3 patients, including PAD in 2. In stent-placement procedures, altered periprocedural antiplatelet (11/12) and postprocedural heparin (6/12) protocols were used without evidence of thromboembolic events. Two patients had early rehemorrhage, including 1 major fatal SAH. Twelve of 13 BBAs showed complete or progressive occlusion at late angiographic follow-up. Clinical midterm outcome was good (mRS scores, 0-2) in 12/13 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coiling of ruptured BBAs is technically challenging but can be done with good midterm results. Reduced periprocedural and postprocedural antiplatelet/anticoagulation protocols may be used with a low reasonable risk of thromboembolic complications. However, regrowth/rerupture remains a problem underlining the importance of early angiographic follow-up and retreatment, including PAD if necessary.",Endovascular Treatment Using Predominantly Stent-Assisted Coil Embolization and Antiplatelet and Anticoagulation Management of Ruptured Blood Blister-Like Aneurysms,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2011,21372169,['Spectroscopy'],1.96,Spectroscopy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.96,"['internal carotid-artery', 'reconstruction', 'nonbranching sites', 'wall']",aneurysms

Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate different variables that prolong ""time to microcatheter."" RESULTS Ninety-one patients underwent emergent endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Mean ""time to microcatheter"" was 174 +/- 60 minutes. No significant time difference was found in patients who were intubated, presented at night or weekends, were administered intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or underwent additional imaging prior to endovascular treatment. ""Time to microcatheter"" was significantly longer in nonlevel I trauma centers and in patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of 10 to 19.

METHODS Thirteen patients with TN and 14 healthy controls underwent HR-DTI scanning. After extracting the trigeminal nerve using a tractography technique, we measured the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and compared the contralateral ratios (CR) of these parameters between the patients and controls, and correlated these ratios with the cross-sectional areas of the nerves. RESULTS The CRs of the FA values for the trigeminal nerves of the patients (1.00 +/- 0.15) had significantly higher variance than those of healthy controls (1.00 +/- 0.05) (P < .05) and showed a positive correlation with the cross-sectional area of the nerves (r = 0.81). In contrast, the CRs of the ADC values were not significantly different between the two groups (1.02 +/- 0.10 and 1.01 +/- 0.08, respectively) and had no significant correlation with cross-sectional area.

214,214,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dysfunction of DA neurotransmission from the SN and VIA has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, including Parkinson disease and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, these midbrain DA structures are difficult to define on clinical MR imaging. To more precisely evaluate the anatomic architecture of the DA midbrain, we scanned healthy participants with a 7T MR imaging system. Here we contrast the performance of high-resolution T2- and T2*-weighted GRASE and FEE MR imaging scans at 7T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy participants were scanned by using GRASE and FEE sequences. CNRs were calculated among the SN, VTA, and RN, and their volumes were estimated by using a segmentation algorithm. RESULTS: Both GRASE and FFE scans revealed visible contrast between midbrain DA regions. The GRASE scan showed higher CNRs compared with the FFE scan. The T2* contrast of the FEE scan further delineated substructures and microvasculature within the midbrain SN and RN. Segmentation and volume estimation of the midbrain SN, RN, and VTA showed individual differences in the size and volume of these structures across participants. CONCLUSIONS: Both GRASE and FFE provide sufficient CNR to evaluate the anatomy of the midbrain DA system.

It is characterized by a slow and progressive atrophy affecting one side of the face, the skin, the subcutaneous tissue, the muscles, the cartilages, and the underlying bony structures. The neurological symptoms usually include focal epilepsy, migraine, and unilateral brain lesions on the same side as the atrophy. A common neuroimaging finding of the syndrome is white matter high signal intensity on brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare and chronic inflammatory disease of the brain that begins in the first decade of life and more rarely in adolescents and adults. It usually involves one hemisphere with focal cortical inflammation. Neurologic symptoms are intractable seizures and progressive hemiplegia. Both PRS and RE are often associated with other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders and only 1 case of both syndromes has been reported in literature. We report the clinical and neuroradiological findings in a 6-year-old boy, presenting with focal hemifacial and arm motor seizures and progressive facial hemiatrophy.

216,216,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Visual disability is common in multiple sclerosis, but its relationship to abnormalities of the optic tracts remains unknown. Because they are only rarely affected by lesions, the optic tracts may represent a good model for assessing the imaging properties of normal-appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis. METHODS Whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging was performed on 34 individuals with multiple sclerosis and 26 healthy volunteers. The optic tracts were reconstructed by tractography, and tract-specific diffusion indices were quantified. In the multiple-sclerosis group, peripapillary retinal nerve-fiber-layer thickness and total macular volume were measured by optical coherence tomography, and visual acuity at 100%, 2.5%, and 1.25% contrast was examined. RESULTS After adjusting for age and sex, optic-tract mean and perpendicular diffusivity were higher (P = .002) in multiple sclerosis. Lower optic-tract fractional anisotropy was correlated with retinal nerve-fiber-layer thinning (r = .51, P = .003) and total-macular-volume reduction (r = .59, P = .002). However, optic-tract diffusion indices were not specifically correlated with visual acuity or with their counterparts in the optic radiation. CONCLUSIONS Optic-tract diffusion abnormalities are associated with retinal damage, suggesting that both may be related to optic-nerve injury, but do not appear to contribute strongly to visual disability in multiple sclerosis.",Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Optic Tracts in Multiple Sclerosis: Association with Retinal Thinning and Visual Disability,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2011,20331501,['DTI'],2.184087363,DTI,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.184087363,"['nerve-fiber layer', 'coherence tomography', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'multiple sclerosis', 'contrast letter acuity', 'optic neuritis']",ms
217,217,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral aneurysms are preferentially located at arterial curvatures and bifurcations that are exposed to major hemodynamic forces, increasingly implicated in the life cycle of aneurysms. By observing the natural history of aneurysm formation from its preaneurysm state, we aimed to examine the hemodynamic microenvironment related to aneurysm initiation at certain arterial segments later developing an aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3 patients included in the study underwent cerebral angiography with 3D reconstruction before a true aneurysm developed. The arterial geometries obtained from the 3D-DSA models were used for flow simulation by using finite-volume modeling. The WSS and SWSSG at the site of the future aneurysm and the flow characteristics of the developed aneurysms were analyzed. RESULTS: The analyzed regions of interest demonstrated significantly increased WSS, accompanied by an increased positive SWSSG in the adjacent proximal region. The WSS reached values of >5 times the temporal average values of the parent vessel, whereas the SWSSG approximated or exceeded peaks of 40 Pa/mm in all 3 cases. All patients developed an aneurysm within 2 years, 1 of which ruptured. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this hemodynamic study, in accordance with the clinical follow-up, suggest that the combination of high WSS and high positive SWSSG focused on a small segment of the arterial wall may have a role in the initiation process of aneurysm formation.",Hemodynamics of Cerebral Aneurysm Initiation: The Role of Wall Shear Stress and Spatial Wall Shear Stress Gradient,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2011,21310860,['Angiography'],2.2,Angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.2,"['intracranial aneurysms', 'complex hemodynamics', 'models', 'flow', 'artery']",aneurysms
218,218,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Measurements of resting-state functional connectivity have increasingly been used for characterization of neuropathologic and neurodevelopmental populations. We collected data to characterize how much imaging time is necessary to obtain reproducible quantitative functional connectivity measurements needed for a reliable single-subject diagnostic test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained 100 five-minute BOLD scans on a single subject, divided into 10 sessions of 10 scans each, with the subject at rest or while watching video clips of cartoons. These data were compared with resting-state BOLD scans from 36 healthy control subjects by evaluating the correlation between each pair of 64 small spheric regions of interest obtained from a published functional brain parcellation. RESULTS: Single-subject and group data converged to reliable estimates of individual and population connectivity values proportional to 1 / sqrt(n). Dramatic improvements in reliability were seen by using <= 25 minutes of imaging time, with smaller improvements for additional time. Functional connectivity ""fingerprints"" for the individual and population began diverging at approximately 15 minutes of imaging time, with increasing reliability even at 4 hours of imaging time. Twenty-five minutes of BOLD imaging time was required before any individual connections could reliably discriminate an individual from a group of healthy control subjects. A classifier discriminating scans during which our subject was resting or watching cartoons was 95% accurate at 10 minutes and 100% accurate at 15 minutes of imaging time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2003 to October 2009, 49 patients (27 men, 22 women; mean age, 52 +/- 12 years) harboring 52 complex unruptured MCA aneurysms (11 ruptured previously and coiled but recanalized and 41 unruptured) were treated by EVT by using self-expandable intracranial stents. Procedural complications, clinical outcome, and initial and midterm angiograpihic results were evaluated. Initial treatment status and aneurysm sac size were tested as potential risk factors for recurrence. RESULTS: After successful stent deployment, coiling was performed in 50 aneurysms (96.2%) in 47 patients; however, 2 failures (3.8%) occurred in 2 patients. Ten intrastent clot formations (20%) observed on final control angiography induced 2 permanent moderate disabilities (GOS score = 2).

221,221,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the PS has been the most promising mechanical thrombectomy device in terms of recanalization rates, even the PS cannot recanalize all cases of occlusion. Under such circumstances, we simply modified the PS, identified certain advantages, and applied this modification as a primary technique for recanalization. Here we describe and discuss the technical details and results of our preliminary experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 22 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to large-artery occlusion who underwent modified thrombectomy by using the PS for recanalization. Direct wedging between the tip of the reperfusion catheter and the proximal part of the clot followed by forceful suction by using a 20- or 50-mL syringe is a unique feature of this technique. What is distinctive is that this does not require use of a separator or aspiration pump. RESULTS: All treated vessels (100%) were successfully recanalized. A TICI scale of 2b or 3 was achieved in 81.9% of patients. A 3-month favorable functional outcome (mRS score, 0-2) was achieved in 45.5% of patients. The only procedural complication was a transient dissection of the proximal ICA, which developed while advancing the guide catheter. CONCLUSIONS: Forced-suction thrombectomy is a simple modification of the PS. On the basis of our data, this technique allows safe and effective revascularization in acute large-vessel occlusion. Thus, for achieving the best outcome, the modified PS technique is proposed as a viable option for acute stroke management, either by itself or in conjunction with other devices or drugs.",Direct Thrombus Retrieval Using the Reperfusion Catheter of the Penumbra System: Forced-Suction Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2011,21087940,['Spectroscopy'],2.33,Spectroscopy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.33,"['controlled-trial', 'recanalization']",stroke

223,223,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Methylation of the MGMT gene promoter is associated with a favorable prognosis in adult patients with GBM treated with TMZ. We determined the incidence of pseudoprogression according to the MGMT methylation status and the potential value of DSC perfusion MR images for predicting pseudoprogression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: New or enlarged enhancing lesions after CCRT in adult patients with newly diagnosed GBMs were prospectively assessed by measuring their rCBV by using DSC perfusion MR images. Tumor tissue was assayed to determine MGMT promoter methylation status. All patients were regularly followed up at an interval of 2 months by MR images, including DSC perfusion MR images. RESULTS: Ninety eligible patients were enrolled in this study. After CCRT, new or enlarged enhanced lesions were found in 59 of 90 patients, which were subsequently classified as pseudoprogression (26 patients, 28.9%) and real progression (33 patients, 36.7%).

223,223,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Methylation of the MGMT gene promoter is associated with a favorable prognosis in adult patients with GBM treated with TMZ. We determined the incidence of pseudoprogression according to the MGMT methylation status and the potential value of DSC perfusion MR images for predicting pseudoprogression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: New or enlarged enhancing lesions after CCRT in adult patients with newly diagnosed GBMs were prospectively assessed by measuring their rCBV by using DSC perfusion MR images. Tumor tissue was assayed to determine MGMT promoter methylation status. All patients were regularly followed up at an interval of 2 months by MR images, including DSC perfusion MR images. RESULTS: Ninety eligible patients were enrolled in this study. After CCRT, new or enlarged enhanced lesions were found in 59 of 90 patients, which were subsequently classified as pseudoprogression (26 patients, 28.9%) and real progression (33 patients, 36.7%).

224,224,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The criterion standard to diagnose and classify cranial DAVFs is DSA. Since this is invasive, relatively expensive and time-consuming, a noninvasive alternative is of interest. We aimed to evaluate the capabilities and pitfalls of 4D-CTA in a consecutive series of patients who presented with a newly diagnosed cranial DAVF, as demonstrated by conventional DSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients were included in this study after biplane DSA demonstrated a cranial DAVF. They subsequently underwent 4D-CTA imaging by using a 320-detector CT scanner. DSA and 4D-CTA studies were independently read by 2 blinded observers, by using a standardized scoring sheet. 4D-CTA results were analyzed with DSA as the criterion standard. RESULTS: In 10 cases, there was full agreement between DSA and 4D-CTA regarding the Borden classification. However, in the remaining patient, a slow-filling DAVF with a low shunt volume was missed by both readers on 4D-CTA.

225,225,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI is an MR imaging measure of brain tissue integrity and provides an attractive metric for use in neuroprotection clinical trials. The purpose of our study was to use DTI to evaluate the longitudinal changes in brain tissue integrity in a group of patients with MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with MS starting natalizumab were imaged serially for 12 months. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions and 20 regions of interest from normal-appearing white and gray matter brain tissue were followed longitudinally. Average values within each region of interest were derived for FA, lambda(parallel to), lambda(perpendicular to), and MD. New T1 black holes were identified at 12 months. Analysis was performed by using mixed-model regression analysis with slope (ie, DTI change per month) as the dependent variable. RESULTS: During 1 year, FA increased in gadolinium-enhancing lesions but decreased in NABT (P < .0001 for both). Changes in FA within gadolinium-enhancing lesions were driven by decreased lambda(perpendicular to) (P < .001), and within NABT, by decreased lambda(parallel to) (P < .0001). A higher lambda(perpendicular to) within gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline predicted conversion to T1 black holes at 12 months. MD was unchanged in both gadolinium-enhancing lesions and NABT. CONCLUSIONS: We observed changes in DTI measures during 1 year in both gadolinium-enhancing lesions and NABT.

Four vessels were harvested at 30 days, and 4, at 90 days, with microscopic examination to assess vessel damage. RESULTS: On deployment, immediate flow was seen in 3/6 vessels; and on retrieval, TIMI-3 recanalization was seen in 6/6. Vasospasm, which resolved on follow-up angiography with no distal emboli or vessel damage, was noted. In the renal vessels, safety evaluation findings were unremarkable, with the exception of 2 vessels harvested from a kidney at 90 days. These 2 vessels appeared without damage on microscopy; however, angiography showed shrinkage of the entire kidney, which was attributed to damage and stenosis of the main renal artery at the site of the guide-catheter insertion, likely leading to a chronic low-flow state and resultant atrophy of the entire kidney.

However, cerebellitis has not attracted much attention. The purpose of this study was to identify and report the clinical and radiologic features of rotavirus cerebellitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of patients with rotavirus gastroenteritis exhibiting cerebellar lesions on MR imaging were collected from multiple centers in Japan. Their clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A diagnosis of acute cerebellitis concurrent with encephalitis was made for 11 of 13 patients identified. Two patients who were diagnosed as having injury due to hypovolemic shock were excluded from the study. All 11 patients with acute cerebellitis had disorders of consciousness with onset on days 2 to 4, followed by mutism in 10 patients. Other cerebellar symptoms included dysarthria following the mutism, hypotonia, ataxia, tremor, nystagmus, and dysmetria. MR imaging lesions in the vermis or cerebellar cortex were seen at some point (day 5 to 1 year) in 10 patients.

Qualitative results, quantitative results, and PCT lesion sizes from DC and MS were statistically compared. RESULTS: CBF and CBV color maps based on DC and MS were of comparably high quality. Quantitative CBF and CBV values calculated by DC and MS were within the same range in nonischemic regions. In suspected penumbra regions, average CBFDC was lower than CBFMS. In suspected infarction core regions, average CBVDC was similar to CBFMS. Using adapted tissue-at-risk/nonviable-tissue thresholds, we found excellent correlation of DC and MS lesion sizes.

However, several benign or non-neoplastic conditions avidly accumulate 18F-FDG, causing ambiguity in interpretation of results. It is unknown whether pituitary adenomas uptake 18F-FDG and appear positive in PET imaging. Here, we present 2 cases of benign pituitary adenoma with elevated metabolic activity in 18F-FDG PET scan. METHODS Medical, neurologic, and psychiatric histories; physical examination findings; laboratory work up results; and pathologic and imaging studies were documented. RESULTS The 18F-FDG-PET images revealed foci of marked FDG uptake in pituitary adenomas of 2 patients.

240,240,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PV is increasingly used as treatment for osteoporotic VCFs. However, controversy exists as to whether PV increases the risk for new VCFs during follow-up. The purpose of our research was to assess the incidence of new VCFs in patients with acute VCFs randomized to PV and conservative therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: VERTOS II is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing PV with conservative therapy in 202 patients. Incidence, distribution, and timing of new VCFs during follow-up were assessed from spine radiographs. In addition, further height loss during follow-up of treated VCFs was measured. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 11.4 months (median, 12.0; range, 1-24 months), 18 new VCFs occurred in 15 of 91 patients after PV and 30 new VCFs in 21 of 85 patients after conservative therapy. This difference was not significant (P = .44). There was no higher fracture risk for adjacent-versus-distant vertebrae. Mean time to new VCF was 16.2 months after PV and 17.8 months after conservative treatment (logrank, P = .45). The baseline number of VCFs was the only risk factor for occurrence (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.95) and number (P = .01) of new VCFs. After conservative therapy, further height loss of treated vertebrae occurred more frequently (35 of 85 versus 11 of 91 patients, P < .001) and was more severe (P < .001) than after PV. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of new VCFs was not different after PV compared with conservative therapy after a mean of 11.4 months' follow-up. The only risk factor for new VCFs was the number of VCFs at baseline.

To assess the true incidence of PCE, we performed native chest CT during follow-up in a large proportion of patients from the VERTOS II trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: VERTOS II is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing PV with conservative therapy in 202 patients. After a mean follow-up of 22 months (median, 21 months; range, 6-42 months), 54 of 78 patients (69%) with 80 vertebrae treated with PV underwent native chest CT to detect possible PCE. The presence, location, number, and size of PCE were recorded. In addition, the presence of pulmonary parenchymal changes adjacent to PCE was noted. Possible risk factors for PCE, such as age, sex, number of treated vertebrae, cement volume per vertebra, and presence and location of perivertebral cement leakage, were evaluated. RESULTS: PCE was detected in 14 of 54 patients (26%; 95% CI, 16%-39%). All patients were asymptomatic. Cement emboli were small and randomly distributed in peripheral small vessels. There were no reactive pulmonary changes. Cement leakage in the azygos vein was the only risk factor for the occurrence of PCE (OR, 43; 95% CI, 5-396).

247,246,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently introduced 320-detector row CT enables whole brain perfusion imaging compared to a limited scanning area in 64-detector row CT. Our aim was to evaluate patient radiation exposure in comprehensive stroke imaging by using multidetector row CT consisting of standard CT of the head, CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, and CTP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Organ doses were measured by using LiF-TLDs located at several organ sites in an Alderson-Rando phantom. Effective doses were derived from these measurements. Stroke protocols including noncontrast head CT, CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, and CTP were performed on 320- and 64-detector row scanners. RESULTS: Measured effective doses for the different scanning protocols ranged between 1.61 and 4.56 mSv, resulting in an effective dose for complete stroke imaging of 7.52/7.54 mSv (m/f) for 64-detector row CT and 10.56/10.6 mSv (m/f) for 320-detector row CT. The highest organ doses within the area of the primary beam were measured in the skin (92 mGy) and cerebral hemispheres (69.91 mGy). Use of an eye-protection device resulted in a 54% decrease of the lens dose measured for the combo protocol for whole-brain perfusion with the 320-detector row CT scanner.

248,247,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Longitudinal MR imaging measures provide an opportunity to track progression in HD before the emergence of clinical symptoms. This may prove useful in assessing disease-modifying treatments. We investigated how caudate and global volumes change as HD progresses from premanifest to early disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty HD gene-positive individuals and 19 controls underwent serial volumetric MR imaging (baseline, 12 and 27 months; 2 or 3 scans per person). At baseline, 3 patients with HD were premanifest but developed overt motor features during the study, and 37 had early HD. All had dates of motor onset recorded. Caudates, lateral ventricles, and TIVs were measured using semiautomated procedures. Linear mixed models were used to investigate differences between HD and controls in relation to motor onset, controlling for TIV, sex, and age. RESULTS: Extrapolating backwards in time, we found that differences in caudate and ventricular volumes between patients with HD and controls were evident 14 and 5 years, respectively, before motor onset (P < .05). At onset, caudate volume was 2.58 mL smaller than that in controls (P < .0001); ventricular volume was 9.27 mL larger (P < .0001). HD caudate atrophy rates were linear, showed low variability between subjects, and were approximately 10-fold higher than those in controls (P < .001). HD ventricular enlargement rates were variable between subjects, were approximately 4-fold higher than those in controls at onset (P < .001), and accelerated with disease duration (P = .02).

WE is characterized by changes in consciousness, ocular dysfunction, and ataxia.

Selective involvement of the cranial nerve nuclei, cerebellum, red nuclei, dentate nuclei, fornix, splenium, cerebral cortex, and basal ganglia characterize nonalcoholic WE patients. Furthermore, symmetric basal ganglia alterations with involvement of the putamen have only been observed in children. The incidence of WE is underestimated in both adult and pediatric patients. Interestingly, the frequency of WE in children appears to be similar to that observed in adults. The prognosis of the disease largely depends on the time from diagnosis to thiamine supplementation.

Transvenous sinus occlusion of ten type I or II DAVFs resulted in cure but was unsuccessful in a single type IV fistula and three of the four indirect carotico-cavernous fistulae treated in this way. Two type I and nine type III/IV were identified in the transarterial, non-Onyx group and three of 11 (27.3%) were cured. Amongst the six type II and 20 type III/IV DAVFs belonging to the transarterial Onyx group, cure was achieved in 17 of 26 (65.4%) rising to 72.7%, considering only those cases where the fistula could be accessed and Onyx was injected. The introduction of Onyx has improved the endovascular cure rate of DAVFs, particularly types III and IV. Advances in technology have made an endovascular approach the management of choice for the majority of DAVFs requiring treatment. Low complication rates are achievable.","Endovascular treatment of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulae: a single-centre, 14-year experience and the impact of Onyx on local practise",NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2010,19894041,['angiography'],1.854974705,angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,1.854974705,"['carotid-cavernous fistula', 'onyx', 'transvenous', 'transarterial embolization', 'endovascular', 'dural arteriovenous fistula']",DAVFs

Our aim was to assess in very preterm infants the reliability of a classification system for WM injury on sequential cUS throughout the neonatal period, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as reference standard. In 110 very preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks), serial cUS during admission (median 8, range 4-22) and again around term equivalent age (TEA) and a single MRI around TEA were performed. cUS during admission were assessed for presence of WM changes, and contemporaneous cUS and MRI around TEA additionally for abnormality of lateral ventricles. Sequential cUS (from birth up to TEA) and MRI were classified as normal/mildly abnormal, moderately abnormal, or severely abnormal, based on a combination of findings of the WM and lateral ventricles. Predictive values of the cUS classification were calculated. Sequential cUS were classified as normal/mildly abnormal, moderately abnormal, and severely abnormal in, respectively, 22%, 65%, and 13% of infants and MRI in, respectively, 30%, 52%, and 18%. The positive predictive value of the cUS classification for the MRI classification was high for severely abnormal WM (0.79) but lower for normal/mildly abnormal (0.67) and moderately abnormal (0.64) WM. Sequential cUS during the neonatal period detects severely abnormal WM in very preterm infants but is less reliable for mildly and moderately abnormal WM.

258,257,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Metallic implants induce massive artifacts in CT images which deteriorate image quality and often superimpose structures of interest. The purpose of this study was to apply and evaluate a dedicated MAR method for neuroradiologic intracranial clips and detachable platinum coiling events. We here report the first clinical results for MAR in FDCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FDCT volume scans of several patients treated with endovascular coiling or intracranial clipping were corrected by using a dedicated FDCT MAR correction algorithm combined with an edge-preserving attenuation-normalization method in the projection space. Corrected and uncorrected images were compared by 2 experienced radiologists and evaluated for several image-quality features. RESULTS: After application of our algorithm, implant delineation and visibility were highly improved. CT values compared with values in metal artifact unaffected areas showed good agreement (average correction of 1300 HU). Image noise was reduced overall by 27%. Intracranial hemorrhage in the direct surroundings of the implanted coil or clip material was displayed without worrisome metal artifacts, and our algorithm even allowed diagnosis in areas where extensive information losses were seen. The high spatial resolution provided by FDCT imaging was well preserved. CONCLUSIONS: Our MAR method provided metal artifact reduced images in every studied case. It reduced image noise and corrected CT values to levels comparable with images measured without metallic implants. An overall improvement of brain tissue modeling and implant visibility was achieved.

259,258,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular TVE for DCCF is used for curative purposes, but serious complications can be caused with inadequate embolization. Our aim was to report clinical characteristics, angiographic findings, and results of endovascular TVE in patients presenting with DCCF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 44 consecutive patients with DCCF treated by TVE. Approach routes, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and complications were assessed. RESULTS: An approach via the internal jugular vein and inferior petrosal sinus was possible in 90% of patients, with complete occlusion of the fistula in 81.6% of patients. A minor residual shunt remained in 13.6% of patients, while a significant shunt remained in 4.5%. In 4 patients, add-on management with transarterial embolization was useful, and in 2 patients with residual shunt, radiosurgery was used. With long-term follow-up (6-40 months), we encountered recanalization/recurrence in 4 patients (9.1%). Complications were seen in the form of permanent morbidity in 3 patients (7%) and transient morbidity in 6 patients (14%).

261,260,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Water in biological structures often displays non-Gaussian diffusion behavior. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of non-Gaussian fitting by using the kurtosis model of the signal intensity decay curves obtained from DWI by using an extended range of b-values in studies of phantoms and HNSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with HNSCC underwent DWI by using 6 b-factors (0, 50-1500 s/mm(2)) at 1.5T. Monoexponential (yielding ADC(mono)) and non-Gaussian kurtosis (yielding apparent diffusion coefficient D-app and apparent kurtosis coefficient K-app) fits were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis in selected regions of interest (primary tumors, metastatic lymph nodes, and spinal cord). DWI studies were also performed on phantoms containing either water or homogenized asparagus. To determine whether the kurtosis model provided a significantly better fit than did the monoexponential model, an F test was performed. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess correlations between K-app and D-app. RESULTS: The kurtosis model fit the experimental data points significantly better than did the monoexponential model (P < .05). D-app was approximately twice the value of ADC(mono) (eg, in neck nodal metastases D-app was 1.54 and ADC(mono) was 0.84). K-app showed a weak Spearman correlation with D-app in a homogenized asparagus phantom and for 44% of tumor lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The use of kurtosis modeling to fit DWI data acquired by using an extended b-value range in HNSCC is feasible and yields a significantly better fit of the data than does monoexponential modeling.

In this prospective observational study, we sought to determine the characteristics of the carotid lesion that predict the development of new surface disruption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight asymptomatic individuals with 50%-79% carotid stenosis underwent carotid MR imaging at baseline and at 3 years. Multicontrast imaging criteria were used to determine the presence or absence of calcification, LRNC, intraplaque hemorrhage, and surface disruption. Volume measurements of plaque morphology and the LRNC and calcification, when present, were collected. RESULTS: At baseline, 21.3% (23/108) of participants were identified with a surface disruption. After 3 years, 9 (10.6%) of the remaining 85 individuals without disruption at baseline developed a new surface disruption during follow-up. Among all baseline variables associated with new surface disruption during regression analysis, the proportion of wall volume occupied by the LRNC (percentage LRNC volume; OR per 5% increase, 2.6; 95% Cl, 1.5-4.6) was the strongest classifier (AUC = 0.95) during ROC analysis. New surface disruption was associated with a significant increase in percentage LRNC volume (1.7 +/- 2.0% per year, P = .035). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective investigation of asymptomatic individuals with 50%-79% stenosis provides compelling evidence that LRNC size may govern the risk of future surface disruption, Identification of carotid plaques in danger of developing new surface disruption may prove clinically valuable for preventing the transition from stable to unstable atherosclerotic disease.",Predictors of Surface Disruption with MR Imaging in Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2010,19833801,['MRI'],2.193913659,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.193913659,"['magnetic-resonance', 'plaque', 'ischemic cerebrovascular events', 'in-vivo']",stenosis

Six asymptomatic volunteers and 12 patients with symptoms related to the brachial plexus underwent DTI on a 1.5T system in addition to the routine anatomic plexus imaging protocol. Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and of fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as tractography of the brachial plexus were obtained. Images were evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists in a prospective fashion. Three patients underwent surgery, and nine patients underwent conservative medical treatment. Reconstructed DTI (17/18) were of good quality (one case could not be reconstructed due to artifacts). In all volunteers and in 11 patients, the roots and the trunks were clearly delineated with tractography. Mean FA and mean ADC values were as follows: 0.30 +/- 0.079 and 1.70 +/- 0.35 mm(2)/s in normal fibers, 0.22 +/- 0.04 and 1.49 +/- 0.49 mm(2)/s in benign neurogenic tumors, and 0.24 +/- 0.08 and 1.51 +/- 0.52 mm(2)/s in malignant tumors, respectively. Although there was no statistically significant difference in FA and ADC values of normal fibers and fibers at the level of pathology, tractography revealed major differences regarding fiber architecture. In benign neurogenic tumors (n = 4), tractography revealed fiber displacement alone (n = 2) or fiber displacement and encasement by the tumor (n = 2), whereas in the malignant tumors, either fiber disruption/destruction with complete disorganization (n = 6) or fiber displacement (n = 1) were seen. In patients with fiber displacement alone, surgery confirmed the tractography findings, and excision was successful without sequelae. Our preliminary data suggest that DTI with tractography is feasible in a clinical routine setting.

270,269,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) accuracy can vary substantially depending on the dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) acquisition and postprocessing methods, due to blood-brain barrier disruption and resulting T1-weighted leakage and T2-and/or T2*-weighted imaging (T2/T2*WI) residual effects. We set out to determine optimal DSC conditions that address these errors and maximize rCBV accuracy in differentiating posttreatment radiation effect (PTRE) and tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with previously treated high-grade gliomas undergoing image-guided re-resection of recurrent contrast-enhancing MR imaging lesions. Thirty-six surgical tissue samples were collected from 11 subjects. Preoperative 3T DSC used 6 sequential evenly timed acquisitions, each by using a 0.05-mmol/kg gadodiamide bolus. Preload dosing (PLD) and baseline subtraction (BLS) techniques corrected T1-weighted leakage and T2/T2*WI residual effects, respectively. PLD amount and incubation time increased with each sequential acquisition.

270,269,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) accuracy can vary substantially depending on the dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) acquisition and postprocessing methods, due to blood-brain barrier disruption and resulting T1-weighted leakage and T2-and/or T2*-weighted imaging (T2/T2*WI) residual effects. We set out to determine optimal DSC conditions that address these errors and maximize rCBV accuracy in differentiating posttreatment radiation effect (PTRE) and tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with previously treated high-grade gliomas undergoing image-guided re-resection of recurrent contrast-enhancing MR imaging lesions. Thirty-six surgical tissue samples were collected from 11 subjects. Preoperative 3T DSC used 6 sequential evenly timed acquisitions, each by using a 0.05-mmol/kg gadodiamide bolus. Preload dosing (PLD) and baseline subtraction (BLS) techniques corrected T1-weighted leakage and T2/T2*WI residual effects, respectively. PLD amount and incubation time increased with each sequential acquisition.

271,270,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Four-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography (4D-CE-MRA) at 3T may replace digital subtraction angrography (DSA) for certain diagnostic purposes in patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 4D-CE-MRA at 3T enables the same characterization of intracranial DAVFs as DSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 18 consecutive patients with intracranial DAVFs (11 women, 7 men; age range, 35-82 years; mean age, 64.8 years). They underwent 4D-CF-MRA at 3T and DSA. The 4D-CE-MRA series combined randomly segmented central k-space ordering, keyhole imaging, sensitivity encoding, and half-Fourier imaging. We obtained 30 dynamic scans every 1.9 seconds with a spatial resolution of 1 X 1 X 1.5 mm. Two independent readers reviewed the 4D-CE-MRA images for main arterial feeders, fistula site, and venous drainage. Interobserver and intermodality agreement was assessed by kappa statistics. RESULTS: At DSA, 8 fistulas were located at the transverse sigmord sinus; 8, at the cavernous sinus; and 2, at the sinus adjacent to the foramen magnum. Interobserver agreement was fair for the main arterial feeders (kappa = 0.59), excellent for the fistula site (kappa = 0.91), and good for venous drainage (kappa = 0,86). Intermodality agreement was moderate for the main arterial feeders (kappa = 0.68) and excellent for the fistula site (kappa = 1.0) and venous drainage (kappa = 1.0).

272,271,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fetal ventriculomegaly (VM) is important because of its high prevalence and high risk of association with other brain abnormalities. The purpose of this article was to investigate the hypotheses that including in utero MR imaging (iuMR) in the diagnostic pathway for fetuses with isolated VM on antenatal imaging will show other brain abnormalities in a high proportion of cases and that these will have a significant effect on clinical management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-seven pregnant women were recruited prospectively from 8 fetomaternal centers in Britain. All of the fetuses had VM diagnosed on sonography but no other abnormality. iuMR was performed, and the results of the examinations were compared with those of sonography. Two fetomaternal experts made independent assessments of the effects of any new diagnoses on clinical management, RESULTS: Categoric assessments of ventricular size were the same in approximately 90% of fetuses. Other abnormalities were shown in 17% of fetuses. The most frequent additional brain abnormality shown on iuMR was agenesis of the corpus callosum. Severe VM was associated with an approximately 10-fold increase in the risk of another brain abnormality being present when compared with fetuses with mild VM. The most profound effects on clinical management, however, were found in cases of mild VM. CONCLUSIONS: This work supports our hypotheses by showing a high detection rate of other brain pathology when iuMR was used to supplement antenatal sonography (17%). In a high proportion of cases, the detection of the extra pathology would have led to significant changes in clinical management.",A Prospective Study of Fetuses with Isolated Ventriculomegaly Investigated by Antenatal Sonography and In Utero MR Imaging,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2010,19762458,['MRI'],2.052370842,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.052370842,"['magnetic-resonance', 'fetal', 'central-nervous-system', 'septum pellucidum']",VM
273,272,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Region-of-interest (ROI) and tract-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses have detected increased apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in callosal and projection systems of adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We explored whether similar changes occur in pediatric patients with MS, assessing 3 major white matter pathways (interhemispheric, projection, and intrahemispheric) in both visibly involved and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI datasets from 10 patients with established pediatric MS and 10 age-sex-, and imaging technique-matched controls were analyzed. Tracts were reconstructed by using a fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm with a diffusion-weighted imaging mask and a 35 degrees angular threshold. Tracts were selected by using standard ROI placements on color FA maps cross-referenced to b = 0 T2-weighted images for studying white matter pathways. Ten identical ROIs were placed in NAWM on b = 0 T2-weighted images to ensure that both ROIs and resulting tracts passed through NAWM. RESULTS: In pediatric MS, all tracts had higher mean ADC values (P = .002 to P < .04) and lower mean FA(P = .009 to P < .02) than those in healthy controls. Even when the tracts were confined to NAWM, the mean ADC was higher (P < .004 to P < .05) and the mean FA was lower (P = .002 to P < .02). T2 lesion burden correlated with tract-based mean ADC. ROI mean ADC increased, and both tract and 1901 mean FA decreased with increasing T2 lesion burden, however with a statistically nonsignificant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased mean ADC and decreased mean FA occur in all 3 major white matter pathways, both in visibly involved white matter and NAWM in pediatric MS.","Tract-Based Analysis of Callosal, Projection, and Association Pathways in Pediatric Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: A Preliminary Study",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2010,19850763,['DTI'],1.981599434,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.981599434,"['white matter', 'diffusion-tensor', 'tensor imaging tractography']",wm
274,273,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often exhibit atypical language patterns, including delay of speech onset, literal speech interpretation, and poor recognition of social and emotional cues in speech. We acquired functional MR images during an auditory language task to evaluate systematic differences in language-network activation between control and high-functioning autistic populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one right-handed male subjects (26 high-functioning autistic subjects, 15 controls) were studied by using an auditory phrase-recognition task, and areas of differential activation between groups were identified. Hand preference, verbal intelligence quotient (10), age, and language-function testing were included as covariables in the analysis. RESULTS: Control and autistic subjects showed similar language-activation networks, with 2 notable differences. Control subjects showed significantly increased activation in the left posterior insula compared with autistic subjects (P < .05, false discovery rate), and autistic subjects showed increased bilaterality of receptive language compared with control subjects. Higher receptive-language scores on standardized testing were associated with greater activation of the posterior aspect of the left Wernicke area. A higher verbal 10 was associated with greater activation of the bilateral Broca area and involvement of the prefrontal cortex and lateral premotor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Control subjects showed greater activation of the posterior insula during receptive language, which may correlate with impaired emotive processing of language in autism.

277,276,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prior studies suggest that aerobic exercise may reduce both the brain atrophy and the decline in fractional anisotropy observed with advancing age. It is reasonable to hypothesize that exercise-induced changes to the vasculature may underlie these anatomic differences. The purpose of this blinded study was to compare high-activity and low-activity healthy elderly volunteers for differences in the cerebrovasculature as calculated from vessels extracted from noninvasive MR angiograms (MRAs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen healthy elderly subjects underwent MRA. Seven subjects reported a high level of aerobic activity (64 +/- 5 years of age; 5 men, 2 women) and 7, a low activity level (68 +/- 6 years of age; 5 women, 2 men). Following vessel segmentation from MRA by an individual blinded to subject activity level, quantitative measures of vessel number, radius, and tortuosity were calculated and histogram analysis of vessel number and radius was performed. RESULTS: Aerobically active subjects exhibited statistically significant reductions in vessel tortuosity and an increased number of small vessels compared with less active subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic activity in elderly subjects is associated with lower vessel tortuosity values and an increase in the number of small-caliber vessels. It is possible that an aerobic exercise program may contribute to healthy brain aging.

278,277,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The endovascular treatment (EVT) of cerebral aneurysms has experienced a revolution since 1991 with the introduction of platinum coil technology. During the past 10 years, there has been significant study of the feasibility of this technique, and clinical results of EVT have been published. The long-term durability of Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization of cerebral aneurysms still remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability of anatomic occlusion of aneurysms and to assess the rate of recanalization and retreatment of these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and December 2003, 1036 aneurysms (804 ruptured and 232 nonruptured) were treated consecutively with GDC coils in 5 neuroradiology centers, Procedural feasibility, acute angiographic occlusion results, morbidity, and mortality associated with this technique were assessed. All patients were regularly followed by digital subtraction angiography and MR imaging each year after treatment. RESULTS: Initial acute angiographic results in 1036 aneurysms demonstrated total occlusion in 731 patients (70.5%), subtotal occlusion in 252 (24.3%), incomplete occlusion in 20 (1.9%), and failures in 33% (3.3%) aneurysms. A remodeling technique was used in 10%. A second procedure was performed for 72 aneurysms (7%). The total aneurysm follow-up time was 49,923 months (4160.25 aneurysm-years). The retreatment period was either in the months following initial treatment in aneurysms incompletely occluded or in years due to recanalization or de novo aneurysms. Fewer than 5 patients rebled during 10 years of follow-up. Long-term follow-up angiograms were obtained in 899 aneurysms, with 646 total, 230 subtotal, and 23 incomplete results.

279,278,"OBJECTIVE To study the clinical and radiological characteristics of levamisole-induced leukoencephalopathy (LILE) in patients with recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) or infected with Ascaris. METHODS The medical histories of 16 patients with LILE were analyzed, including clinical manifestations, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain biopsy findings. RESULTS The main clinical manifestations of LILE were motor weakness (75.0%), dysphasia or aphasia (50.0%), cognitive disorder (50.0%), and facial palsy (43.8%). The MRI of 16 cases showed plaque and round or oval demyelinating lesions in white matter, which revealed a signal hypointensity on T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and demonstrated hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The MRI revealed peripheral ring-type enhancement about the focus after Gd-DTPA administration and edema around some lesions, without mass effect. T2-weighted and FLAIR images were highly sensitive to the lesions. Brain biopsy in 1 patient showed multifocal demyelinating lesions without perivascular cuffing by lymphocytes. Treatment generally consisted of steroids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and patients recovered to normal condition.

280,279,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), postmortem studies show different topographic involvement of the thalamus, basal ganglia, and their cortical connections. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MR imaging technique sensitive to gray and white matter microstructure integrity. This study was performed to determine whether DTI may demonstrate microstructural differences between PSP and CBD, particularly within the thalamus and its cortical connections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients with probable PSP, 11 with probable CBD, and 7 controls formed the study group. Apparent diffusion coefficient average (ADC(ave)) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured in regions of interest positioned in the ventrolateral (motor), medial, anterior, and posterior regions of the thalami, basal ganglia, fronto-orbital white matter, cingulum, supplementary motor area (SMA), and precentral and postcentral gyri in patients and controls. RESULTS: In PSP, ADC v. values were increased in several areas: the thalamus, particularly in its anterior and medial nuclei; cingulum; motor area; and SMA. FA values were particularly decreased in the fronto-orbital white matter, anterior cingulum, and motor area. In CBD, ADC,,. was increased in the motor thalamus, in the precentral and postcentral gyri, ipsilateral to the affected frontoparietal cortex, and in the bilateral SMA. FA was mainly decreased in the precentral gyrus and SMA, followed by the postcentral gyrus and cingulum.

281,280,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) remains one of the few uncontested indications for catheter based cerebral angiography. We report our experience of using a commercially available form of time-resolved MR angiography (trMRA) at 3T for the diagnosis and classification of a cranial DAVF compared with the reference standard of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of our patient records identified patients who had undergone trMRA at 3T and DSA for the evaluation of DAVF. The trMRA consisted of whole-head, contrast-enhanced ""time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics"" (TRICKS) MRA. Image sets were independently reviewed by 3 readers for the presence, location, and classification of a DAVF. The reported result of the DSA was used as the gold standard against which the performance of the trMRA was measured. RESULTS: Forty patients were identified who had undergone DSA and trMRA for evaluation of DAVF, yielding a total of 42 cases. On DSA, the results of 7 cases were normal, 15 cases were performed for surveillance of a previously cured fistula, and a new fistula (14) or persistent (6) fistula was found in 20 cases. Of these 20 fistulas, on DSA, 13 were Borden 1, 2 were Borden II, and 5 were Borden III. In 93% (39/42) of DAVF cases, the 3 readers were unanimous and correct in their independent interpretation of the trMRA, correctly identifying (or excluding) all fistulas and accurately classifying them when encountered.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, clinical, and angiographic follow-up of stent-only therapy for VBDA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with 29 VBDAs (11 ruptured, 18 unruptured), not suitable for deconstructive treatment, underwent stent-only therapy. Feasibility, safety, clinical, and angiographic follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. Angiographic outcomes were compared between single-stent and multiple-stent groups. RESULTS: All attempted stent placements were successfully accomplished without any treatment-related complication. Of the 11 ruptured VBDAs, 4 were treated by single stents, 6 by double overlapping stents, and I by triple overlapping stents, Of the 18 unruptured VBDAs, 6 were treated by stents, and 12 by double overlapping stents.

Methods Four standardised coronal MR images from 36 subjects encompassing controls and cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were used. After initial pilot studies, 15 regions produced good intra-and inter-rater reliability. We then validated the ratings against manual volumetry and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and compared ratings across the subject groups. Results Validation against both manual volumetry (for both frontal and temporal lobes), and against whole brain VBM, showed good correlation with visual ratings for the majority of the brain regions. Comparison of rating scores across disease groups showed involvement of the anterior fusiform gyrus, anterior hippocampus and temporal pole in semantic dementia, while anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal regions were involved in behavioural variant FTD. Conclusion This simple visual rating can be used as an alternative to highly technical methods of quantification, and may be superior when dealing with single cases or small groups.",Development of an MRI rating scale for multiple brain regions: comparison with volumetrics and with voxel-based morphometry,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2009,19308367,['MRI'],1.917177914,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,1.917177914,"['vbm', 'temporal-lobe atrophy', 'mri', 'dementia', 'visual rating scale', 'frontotemporal']",athrophy
286,285,"Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) are long-term epilepsy associated tumors subdivided into simple and complex variants. The purpose of this study was to relate different DNT components identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to histopathological features and to test the hypothesis that glial nodules as a histopathological feature of complex variants induce an occasional glioma misdiagnosis. Clinical, MRI, and histopathologic features of DNTs operated between 1988 and 2008 were reviewed. From a total of 61 DNTs, 48 simple and 13 complex variants were identified. Multiple or single pseudocysts in a cortical/subcortical location with small cysts sometimes separated from the tumor represented the glioneuronal element and were found in all DNTs. FLAIR hyperintense tissue was found between pseudocysts but-in neocortical DNTs-also circumscript in deeper tumor parts. Calcification and hemorrhages in this location occurred in four of 13 complex variants, and one of these patients was also the only one with tumor growth. Patients with complex variants had earlier seizure onset, and complex variants were more often located outside the temporal lobe. Although complex variants represented a higher diagnostic challenge, misdiagnoses also occurred in simple variants. One of five of DNTs showed contrast enhancement, which varied on follow-up studies with enhancing parts becoming nonenhancing and vice versa. The glioneuronal element is readily identifiable on MRI and should be considered to support the DNT diagnosis. Complex DNT variants have a different clinical profile and a more variable histopathological and MRI appearance; however, misdiagnoses occasionally also occur in simple variants.","Simple and complex dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNT) variants: clinical profile, MRI, and histopathology",NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2009,19242688,['MRI'],2.377300613,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.377300613,"['ct', 'dnt', 'features', 'diffusion', 'epilepsy', 'dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor', 'mri', 'series', 'diagnosis']",tumor
287,286,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have demonstrated limited benefit with endovascular procedures such as stent placement in octogenarians. We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of intra-arterial recanalization techniques to treat ischemic stroke in patients 80 years or older presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We pooled the data from 4 prospective studies by evaluating intra-arterial recanalization techniques for treatment of ischemic stroke. Clinical and rachologic evaluations were performed before treatment and at 24 hours, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months after treatment, We performed multivariate analyses to evaluate the effect of ages 80 years and older on angiographic recanalization, favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale of 0-2), and mortality rate at I to 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were treated in the 4 protocols. Of these, 24 were 80 years or older. There was no significant difference between the 2 age groups in sex, initial stroke severity, time to treatment, site of vascular occlusion, and rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In logistic regression analysis, age 80 years or older was associated with a lower likelihood of a favorable outcome (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-1.2; P = 11) and recanalization (OR, 0.36; 95% Cl, 0.12-1.1; P = .07) and with higher mortality rate (OR, 3.17; 95% Cl, 1.05-9.55; P = .04) after adjusting for study protocol. After adjusting for recanalization in addition to study protocol, the older age group still had a lower likelihood of favorable outcomes (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1; P = .07) and higher mortality rates (OR, 3,62; 95% Cl, 1.15-11.36; P = .027. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that patients 80 years and older are at higher risk for poor outcome at 1 to 3 months following intra-arterial recanalization techniques.

288,287,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity is hypothesized to represent irreversibly infracted tissue (ischemic core) in the setting of acute stroke, Measurement of the ischemic core has implications for both prognosis and therapy. We wished to assess the level of evidence in the literature supporting this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature relating to tissue outcomes of DWI hyperintense stroke lesions in humans. The methodologic rigor of studies was evaluated by using criteria set out by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Data from individual studies were also analyzed to determine the prevalence of patients demonstrating lesion progression, no change, or lesion regression compared with follow-up imaging. RESULTS: Limited numbers of highly methodologically rigorous studies (Oxford levels 1 and 2) were available. There was great variability in observed rates of DWI lesion reversal (0%-83%), with a surprisingly high mean rate of DWI lesion reversal (24% of pooled patients). Many studies did not include sufficient data to determine the precise prevalence of DWI lesion growth or reversal. CONCLUSIONS: The available tissue-outcome evidence supporting the hypothesis that DWI is a surrogate marker for ischemic core in humans is troublingly inconsistent and merits an overall grade D based on the criteria set out by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.",Does Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Represent the Ischemic Core?

289,288,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Essential tremor (ET) is a slowly progressive disorder characterized by postural and kinetic tremors most commonly affecting the forearms and hands. Several lines of evidence from physiologic and neuroimaging studies point toward a major role of the cerebellum in this disease. Recently, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been proposed to quantify cerebellar atrophy in ET. However, VBM was not originally designed to study subcortical structures, and the complicated anatomy of the cerebellum may hamper the automatic processing of VBM. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and utility of using automated subcortical segmentation to identify atrophy of the cerebellum and other subcortical structures in patients with ET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a recently developed automated volumetric method (FreeSurfer) to quantify subcortical atrophy in ET by comparing results obtained with this method with those provided by previous evidence. The study included T1-weighted MR images of 46 patients with ET grouped into those having arm ET (n = 27, a-ET) or head ET (n = 19, h-ET) and 28 healthy controls. RESULTS: Results revealed the expected reduction of cerebellar volume in patients with h-ET with respect to healthy controls after controlling for intracranial volume. No significant difference was detected in any other subcortical area. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric data obtained with automated segmentation of subcortical and cerebellar structures approximate data from a previous study based on VBM.

290,289,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-neuroradiological entity, characterized by typical neurological deficits, distinctive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and a usually benign clinical course. Although frequently seen in association with hypertensive conditions, many other predisposing factors, notably cytotoxic and immunosuppressant drugs have been associated with PRES. The aim of this study was to determine differences in the MR appearance of PRES according to various risk factors. Thirty consecutive patients with clinical and MRI findings consistent with PRES were included. We identified 24 patients with hypertension-related conditions, including 14 patients with preeclampsia-eclampsia, and six patients without hypertension, in whom PRES was associated with exposition to neurotoxic substances. Lesion distribution, extent of disease, and number of affected brain regions were compared between patients with PRES with and without hypertension, and patients with PRES with and without preeclampsia-eclampsia, respectively. No statistically significant differences in distribution of lesions and extent of disease were observed between patients with PRES with or without hypertension, and patients with or without preeclampsia-eclampsia, respectively. The number of affected brain regions was significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia-eclampsia (p = 0.046), and the basal ganglia region was more frequently involved in these patients (p = 0.066). Apart from a significant higher number of involved brain regions and a tendency for basal ganglia involvement in patients with PRES associated with preeclampsia-eclampsia, the MRI appearance of patients with PRES does not seem to be influenced by predisposing risk factors.",Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: do predisposing risk factors make a difference in MRI appearance?,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2009,19234694,['MRI'],2.530674847,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.530674847,"['posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome', 'hypertensive', 'cyclosporine-a', 'human-endothelial-cells', 'leukoencephalopathy syndrome']",encephalopathy
291,290,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current classification and grading of primary brain tumors has significant limitations. Our aim was to determine whether the relative cerebral volume (rCBV) measurements in gliomas may serve as an adjunct to histopathologic grading, with a hypothesis that rCBV values are more accurate in predicting 1-year survival and recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-tour patients with gliomas (WHO grade I-IV, 27 astrocytomas, 7 tumors with oligodendroglial components) underwent contrast-enhanced MR rCBV measurements before treatment. The region of interest and the single pixel with the maximum CBV value within the tumors were normalized relative to the contralateral normal tissue (rCBV(mean) and rCBV(max), respectively). Karnofsky performance score and progression-free survival (PFS) were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curves and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were conducted for CBV and histologic grade (WHO grade). RESULTS: Significant correlations were detected only when patients with oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas were excluded. The rCBV(mean) and rCBV(max) in the astrocytomas were 3.5 +/- 2.9 and 3.7 +/- 2.7. PFS correlated with rCBV parameters (r = -0.54 to -0.56, P <= .009). WHO grade correlated with rCBV values (r = 0.65, P <= .0002). rCBV(max) >4.2 was found to be a significant cutoff value for recurrence prediction with 77.8% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity (P = .0001). rCBV(max) <= 3.8 was a significant predictor for 1-year survival (93.7% sensitivity, 72.7% specificity, P = .0002). The relative risk for shorter PFS was 11.1 times higher for rCBV(max) >4.2 (P = .0006) and 6.7 times higher for WHO grade >II (P = .05). The combined CBV-WHO grade classification enhanced the predictive value for recurrence/progression (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: rCBV values in astrocytomas but not tumors with oligodendroglial components are predictive for recurrence and 1-year survival and may be more accurate than histopathologic grading.",Cerebral Blood Volume Measurements by Perfusion-Weighted MR Imaging in Gliomas: Ready for Prime Time in Predicting Short-Term Outcome and Recurrent Disease?,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2009,19179427,['MRP'],1.865671642,MRP,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.865671642,"['survival', 'low-grade glioma', 'prognostic-factors', 'adult patients']",tumor

This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of CCD observed in acute stroke by retrospective review of a research data base of patients with acute stroke evaluated by diffusion-weighted (DWI) and dynamic contrast susceptibility perfusion MR imaging (PWI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: PWI scans of 301 consecutive patients with acute stroke and positive DWI abnormality from a research data base were reviewed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PWI scans of 301 consecutive patients with acute stroke and positive DWI abnormality from a research data base were reviewed.

293,292,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coiling of very small (<= 3 mm) aneurysms is considered controversial because of technical difficulties and a higher rate of procedural aneurysm ruptures. In this study, we report clinical and angiographic results Of Coiling of aneurysms 3 mm or smaller in comparison with larger aneurysms in a large, single-center cohort of patients, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and July 2008, a total of 1295 aneurysms were selectively occluded with coils. Of 1295 aneurysms, 196 (15.1%) in 187 patients were very small. Of 196 aneurysms, 149 (76%) had ruptured and 47 (24%) had not ruptured. There were 51 males (27%) and 136 females (73%). Mean age was 54.7 years (age range, 11-78 years). RESULTS: Procedural morbidity rate was 2.1% and mortality rate, 1.1%. Procedural rupture occurred in 15 of 196 aneurysms (7.7%). In 13 of 15 procedural ruptures, this had no adverse effect oil outcome. Early recurrent hemorrhage of the coiled aneurysm occurred in 2 patients (1.1%). Compared with larger aneurysms, in very small aneurysms more often a procedural rupture occurred (7.7% versus 3.6%; P=.018). Procedural morbidity rate was lower (3.2% versus 5.5%), but this was not significant (P=.26). Retreatment rate consisted predominantly of clipping soon after incomplete coiling and was lower than in larger aneurysms (5.1% versus 10.0%; P=.041). Other characteristics were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Coiling of very small aneurysms was technically feasible, with good results. Although procedural aneurysm rupture was significantly more frequent in very small aneurysms, this did not lead to increased overall morbidity and mortality rates.

However, reports on complications caused by this technique have been limited. We present the initial Beijing Tiantan Hospital experience with adverse events related to transarterial Onyx embolization for DAVFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2005 and February 2008, a total of 40 patients with DAVFs were treated at our institute with Onyx-18. There were 11 women and 29 men with a mean age of 43.15 years (age range, 23-60 years). We reviewed the clinical presentation, angiographic features, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: In 40 patients, total obliteration was achieved in 25 DAVFs (62.5%), with the remaining 15 patients not cured with residual shunts. Complications occurred in 9 patients, 5 DAVFs were located at tentorium, 2 were located at the transverse-sigmoid sinus, 1 was found at the inferior petrosal sinus, and 1 was found at the cavernous sinus, leading to permanent disability in 3 patients (morbidity, 7.5%).

295,294,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional state between normal aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Our goal was to determine if specific temporoparietal regions can predict the time to progress from MCI to AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR images from 129 individuals with MCI were analyzed to identify the volume of 14 neocortical and 2 non-neocortical brain regions, comprising the temporal and parietal lobes. In addition, 3 neuropsychological test scores were included to determine whether they would provide independent information. After a mean follow-up time of 5 years, 44 of these individuals had progressed to a diagnosis of AD. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated significant effects for 6 MR imaging regions with the greatest differences being the following: the entorhinal cortex (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, P <.001), inferior parietal lobule (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64, P <.005), and middle temporal gyrus (HR = 0.64, P <.004), indicating decreased risk with larger volumes. A multivariable model showed that a combination of the entorhinal cortex (HR = 0.60, P <.001) and the inferior parietal lobule (HR = 0.62, P <.01) was the best predictor of time to progress to AD. A multivariable model reiterated the importance of including both MR imaging and neuropsychological variables in the final model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reaffirm the importance of the entorhinal cortex and present evidence for the importance of the inferior parietal lobule as a predictor of time to progress from MCI to AD. The inclusion of neuropsychological performance in the final model continues to highlight the importance of using these measures in a complementary fashion.",Temporoparietal MR Imaging Measures of Atrophy in Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment That Predict Subsequent Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2009,19112067,['MRI'],2.313432836,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.313432836,"['entorhinal cortex neurons', 'surface-based analysis', 'human']",dementia
296,295,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiating between tumors and pseudotumoral lesions by conventional MR imaging may be a challenging question. This study aims to evaluate the potential usefulness and the added value that single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy could provide on this discrimination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 solid brain lesions were retrospectively included in the study (68 glial tumors and 16 pseudotumoral lesions). Single-voxel spectra at TE 30 ms (short TE) and 136 ms (long TE) were available in all cases. Two groups were defined: ""training-set"" (56 cases) and ""test-set"" (28 cases). Tumors and pseudotumors were compared in the training-set with the Mann-Whitney U test. Ratios between resonances were defined as classifiers for new cases, and thresholds were selected with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The added value of spectroscopy was evaluated by 5 neuroradiologists and assessed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: Differences between tumors and pseudotumors were found in myo-inositol (mlns); P<.01) at short TE, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA; P <.001), glutamine (Glx; P <.01), and choline (CHO; P <.05) at long TE. Classifiers suggested tumor when mlns/NAA ratio was more than 0.9 at short TE and also when CHO/NAA ratio was more than 1.9 at long TE. Classifier accuracy was tested in the test-set with the following results: short TE, 82% (23/28); long TE, 79% (22/28). The neuroradiologists' confidence rating of the test-cases on a 5-point scale (0-4) improved between 5% (from 2.86-3) and 27% (from 2.25-2.86) with spectroscopy (mean, 17%; P <.01).

297,296,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) vascular hyperintensities (FVH) are commonly encountered on MR imaging studies performed shortly after the onset of acute ischemic stroke. Prior reports have speculated regarding the pathogenesis of this finding, yet definitive correlative angiographic studies have not been performed. We studied the pathophysiologic and hemodynamic correlates of FVH on conventional angiography and concurrent MR imaging sequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of FLAIR and gradient-refocused echo MR imaging sequences acquired immediately before conventional angiography for acute stroke was conducted in a blinded fashion. The presence, location, and morphology of FVH were noted and correlated with markers of thrombotic occlusion and collateral flow on angiography. Angiographic collaterals were graded on a 5-point scale incorporating extent and hemodynamic aspects. RESULTS: A prospective ischemic stroke registry of 632 patients was searched to identify 74 patients (mean age, 63.4 +/- 20 years; 48% women) having undergone FLAIR sequences immediately before angiography. Median time from FLAIR to angiography was 2.9 hours (interquartile range, 1.1-4.7 hours). FVH were present in 53/74 (72%) of all acute stroke cases with subsequent angiography. FVH distal to an arterial occlusion were associated with a high grade of leptomeningeal collateral blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: FVH are observed in areas of blood flow proximal and distal to stenosis or occlusion and are noted with more extensive collateral circulation.","Angiography Reveals That Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Vascular Hyperintensities Are Due to Slow Flow, Not Thrombus",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2009,19022866,['Angiography'],2.164179104,Angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.164179104,"['intraarterial signal', 'vessels', 'images', 'stroke', 'flair mri']",stroke

RESULTS: In 136 patients, a primary parotid gland tumor was confirmed by histology. Among the observers, a high correlation was calculated (0.98). ADC values of pleomorphic adenomas were significantly higher than those of all other entities, except for myoepithelial adenomas (P = .054).

300,299,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anomalies associated with callosal agenesis (ACC) found postnatally have been well documented. However, to our knowledge, no detailed MR imaging analysis of associated anomalies has been reported in a large cohort of fetuses with ACC. This study will assess those anomalies and compare them with postnatal cohorts of ACC, to identify associated fetal brain abnormalities that may give insight into etiology and outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of ACC diagnosed on fetal MR imaging during an 11-year period were retrospectively reviewed, including fetal MR imaging, postnatal MR imaging, and autopsy findings. Neurodevelopmental outcome was classified as poor in children with seizures and/or severe neurodevelopmental impairment or in cases of neonatal death. RESULTS: Twenty-nine cases of ACC were identified. Median gestational age was 26.14 weeks (range, 19.71-36.43 weeks). Twenty-three fetuses had delayed sulcation and/or too-numerous cortical infoldings (abnormal morphology). Fifteen fetuses had cerebellar and/or brain stem abnormalities. Fetal MR imaging findings suggested a genetic syndrome in 5 fetuses and an acquired etiology or genetic/ metabolic disorder in 2 fetuses. Findings were confirmed in 8 cases with postnatal MR imaging, except for delayed sulcation and small vermis, and in 4 cases with autopsy, except for periventricular nodular heterotopia and abnormalities in areas not examined by autopsy. Neurodevelopmental outcome was good in 7 and poor in 9 children. Abnormal sulcal morphology and/or infratentorial abnormalities were present in those with poor outcome and absent in those with good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: ACC is infrequently isolated in fetuses.

301,300,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known about the anatomic connectivity of callosal axons in individuals with partial agenesis of the corpus callosum (pAgCC). We used tractography based on both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) to investigate interhemispheric white matter connectivity in pAgCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and HARDI were performed at 3T on 6 individuals with pAgCC and 8 control subjects. For HARDI analysis, a Q-ball reconstruction method capable of visualizing multiple intravoxel fiber orientations was used. In both DTI and HARDI, whole-brain 3D fiber tractography was performed by using deterministic streamline algorithms. Callosal fibers were then segmented to identify separately connections between homologous cortical regions (homotopic fibers) and nonhomologous regions (heterotopic fibers) by using manually drawn regions of interest. RESULTS: In control individuals, we observed densely connected homotopic fibers. However, in individuals with pAgCC, we identified not only homotopic connections but also heterotopic connections in 4 of 6 subjects. Furthermore, the observed homotopic connections in pAgCC did not necessarily correlate with the position or size of the residual callosum. The nature of homotopic and heterotopic connectivity varied considerably among subjects with pAgCC, and HARDI recovered more callosal fibers than DTI. CONCLUSION: Individuals with pAgCC demonstrate a remarkable diversity of callosal connectivity, including a number of heterotopic tracts that are absent in healthy subjects. The patterns of their callosal connections cannot be predicted from the appearance of their callosal fragments on conventional MR imaging.

The purpose of this study was to describe MR imaging features, including T2*gradient-echo (GE) sequence, in presumed ICoVT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging examinations were performed in 8 patients with ICoVT (MR venography was performed in all patients and digital substraction angiography in 4) at the time of diagnosis and during the follow-up at 15 days (4 patients) and at 3 (8 patients), 6 (6 patients), 12 (3 patients), and 18 months (1 patient). We assessed the presence of a magnetic susceptibility effect (MSE) on T2*GE imaging at each site of cerebral venous thrombosis and the presence or absence of a normal flow void and iso-, hypo-, or hyperintense signal intensity on T1, T2, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Parenchymal signal-intensity changes were also assessed on the same sequences. RESULTS: MSE was detected on T2*GE imaging at the site of a cortical vein in all subjects at the first MR imaging examination. The occluded vein appeared as hyperintense in 3 patients, iso- to slightly hyperintense in 1 on T1, hypointense in 6 on FLAIR images, and as signal-intensity loss on DWI in 3. At follow-up, persisting signal-intensity abnormalities on T2*GE imaging were detected at the venous sites in all patients, whereas signal-intensity changes on T1- and T2-weighted images were no longer present. Parenchymal hyperintensities on FLAIR and DWI (increased apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) were observed in close vicinity to the thrombosis in 6/8 patients. Petechial hemorrhages (n = 3) or hematoma (n = 2) was present on T2*GE imaging in 5/8 patients. During the follow-up, all cerebral tissue signal-intensity changes on T1, T2, and FLAIR images decreased both in volume and intensity. ADC values normalized within the tissue after 3 months in all patients.

RESULTS: MSE was detected on T2*GE imaging at the site of a cortical vein in all subjects at the first MR imaging examination. The occluded vein appeared as hyperintense in 3 patients, iso- to slightly hyperintense in 1 on T1, hypointense in 6 on FLAIR images, and as signal-intensity loss on DWI in 3. At follow-up, persisting signal-intensity abnormalities on T2*GE imaging were detected at the venous sites in all patients, whereas signal-intensity changes on T1- and T2-weighted images were no longer present.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with suggested postoperative recurrent middle ear cholesteatoma underwent 3T MR imaging with PROPELLER DWI, ASSET echo-planar DWI, and late postgadolinium T1-weighted MR imaging. Three radiologists (2 seniors, 1 fellow) analyzed unlabeled images for Visualization of recurrence. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement was assessed by using the Cohen kappa statistic test. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were assessed for the 3 observers. RESULTS: Nineteen recurrent cholesteatomas were diagnosed. PROPELLER interobserver agreement was very good (1, 0.89, 0.89) among the 3 observers, Intraobserver agreement between PROPELLER and T1-weighted imaging was very good to moderate (0.88, 0.57, 0.58). PROPELLER DWI provided less interobserver variability than other sequences, and the best sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value.

306,305,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whether treatment of small asymptomatic aneurysms is appropriate or not remains controversial. We performed a retrospective study on the procedural morbidity and mortality of coil embolization of small asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) to obtain a more generalized estimate of procedural risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 435 small (maximum diameter <= 7 mm) asymptomatic UIAs in 370 patients were treated by coil embolization. Aneurysm sizes were determined by using 3D angiograms. We assessed procedure-related morbidity and mortality, immediate postprocedural angiographic results, short-term imaging follow-up results, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Initial aneurysm occlusion was complete in 334 aneurysms, near complete in 78, and incomplete in 22. One internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that ruptured during the procedure was treated with parent artery occlusion, Two hundred wide-neck aneurysms were coiled with the aid of various neck-remodeling techniques, The 44 procedure-related complications were the following: 24 thromboembolisms, 11 coil protrusions or prolapses into the parent vessel, 4 intraprocedural ruptures, 3 device-related complications, and 2 femoral-access complications. We had a total of 44 (10.1 %) procedure-related complications with only I leading to persistent neurologic deficit. Procedure-related permanent morbidity and mortality were 0.27% (1/370) and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of small unruptured asymptomatic aneurysms, endovascular treatment was achieved with good short-term angiographic outcome and low permanent neurologic impairment.

307,306,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microinvasive tumor cells, which are not detected on conventional imaging, contribute to poor prognoses for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO grade IV). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise in being able to detect this infiltration. This study aims to detect a difference in diffusion properties between GBM (infiltrative) and brain metastases (noninfiltrative). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 49 tumors (30 GBM, 19 metastases), DTI measures (p, q, L, and fractional anisotropy [FA]) were calculated for regions of gross tumor (excluding hemorrhagic and necrotic core), periturnoral edema, peritumoral margin (edema most adjacent to tumor), adjacent normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and contralateral white matter. Parametric and nonparametric statistical tests were used to determine significance, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean values of p, L, and FA from regions of signal-intensity abnormality differed from those of normal brain in both tumors. The mean q value did not differ significantly compared with that in normal brain in any region in metastases or in adjacent NAWM of GBM. For GBM compared with metastases, q and FA were significantly lower in gross tumor (P < .001) and q was significantly lower in periturnoral margin (P < .001), which may be due to tumor infiltration. Significant overlap was present, which was reflected in the ROC curve analyses (area under the curve values from 0.732 to 0,804). CONCLUSIONS: DTI may be used to help differentiate between GBM and brain metastases. The results also suggest that DTI has the potential to assist in detecting infiltrative tumor cells in surrounding brain.","Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Glioblastoma Multiforme and Brain Metastases: The Role of p, q, L, and Fractional Anisotropy",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2009,18842762,['DTI'],1.865671642,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.865671642,"['high-grade gliomas', 'white matter', 'tumor', 'cerebral gliomas']",tumor

312,311,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visual field defects sometimes occur after temporal resection surgery. Our purpose was to evaluate the correlation between visual field defects caused by temporal lobe resection and the degree of resection of the Meyer loop, as assessed by diffusion tensor tractography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 14 patients who underwent temporal resection for temporal lobe epilepsy. We obtained presurgical tractographies and then measured the distance between the temporal tip and the anterior limit of the Meyer loop (T-M distance). The degree of resection of the Meyer loop was defined as the distance from the anterior limit of the Meyer loop to the posterior limit of the temporal lobe resection (M-R distance). This was calculated by subtracting the T-M distance from the measured distance between the temporal tip and the posterior limit of the resection (T-R distance). RESULTS: The mean T-M distance was 36.6 mm. The interindividual variation of the distance ranged from 30.0 to 43.2 mm. Although there was no statistically significant correlation between the extent of the visual field defect and the T-R distance, there was a statistically significant correlation between the degree of the visual field defect and the M-R distance. CONCLUSION: The range of interindividual variation for the position of the Meyer loop was rather large, indicating that this variation is the key factor in visual field defects after temporal lobectomy, and the visual field defect appears to be predicted by presurgical tractography.

313,312,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent systems for intracranial use are continuously improved. We report our initial experience using a new self-expanding easy-to-place nitinol stent (Enterprise) in the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January and October 2007, 16 aneurysms in 15 patients were treated with stent assistance, Aneurysm size was a mean of 13.2 mm (median, 12 mm; range, 7-30 mm). Eight aneurysms had reopened after prior coiling, and 8 aneurysms were primarily treated, 1 after acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Response to antiplatelet premedication was tested with a P2Y12 assay before stent placement. On a 3D angiographic workstation, stent placement was simulated to assess vessel caliber and appropriate stent length. RESULTS: In all aneurysms, the stent could be placed at the exact location as predicted from the computer simulation. Stent placement proved to be technically easy without the need for recapture in all patients, Although placement of the microcatheter through the stent struts and subsequent coil placement was challenging in some patients, coiling after stent placement resulted in complete or near-complete occlusion in all aneurysms. There were no technical or clinical complications. At 6 months, angiographic follow-up in 14 aneurysms revealed 4 aneurysms recanalized to 80% occlusion, 3 of which were additionally coiled. CONCLUSION: In this small series, delivery and deployment of the Enterprise stent was technically easy. There were no technical or clinical complications.

In seven patients, the procedure was performed during acute stroke intervention. Procedural success, clinical complication rates and midterm follow-up data were prospectively recorded. Results During a median follow-up period of 7.3 months one additional patient died of an unknown cause 3 months after the intervention. A patient with a significant residual stenosis presented with a new stroke after further progression of the residual stenosis. None of the successfully treated patients experienced ipsilateral stroke. Conclusion Recanalization of intracranial stenoses with the balloon-expandable Pharos stent is technically feasible. The periprocedural complication rate and mid-term follow-up results were in the range of previously reported case series.

MRI traits may improve our ability to identify genes associated with AD-outcomes. We evaluated semi-quantitative MRI measures as endophenotypes for genetic studies by assessing their association with AD in families from the Multi-Institutional Research in Alzheimer Genetic Epidemiotogy (MIRAGE) Study. METHODS Discordant siblings from multiple ethnicities were ascertained through a single affected proband. Semi-quantitative MRI measures were obtained for each individual. The association between continuous/ordinal MRI traits and AD were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Medical. history and Apolipoprotein E (APOE)epsilon 4 status were evaluated as potential confounders. RESULTS Comparisons of 214 affected and 234 unaffected subjects from 229 sibships reveated that general cerebral atrophy, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and mediotemporat atrophy differed significantly between groups (each at P < .0001) and varied by ethnicity. Age at MRI and duration of AD confounded all associations between AD and MRI traits. Among unaffected sibs, the presence of at least one APOE epsilon 4 allele and MRI infarction was associated with more WMH after adjusting for age at MRI. CONCLUSION The strong association between MRI traits and AD suggests that MRI traits may be informative endophenotypes for basic and clinical. studies of AD.

316,315,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We attempted to measure DTI parameters of the brainstem pyramidal tract using two approaches, ie, simple ROI and tract-specific analyses. Results obtained for healthy subjects and ALS patients were compared. METHODS DTI was performed using a single shot SE-EPI with 25 noncollinear diffusion gradient directions (b = 1000 second/mm(2)) and with no diffusion gradient on a 3.0-T MR system in 10 ALS patients and in 8 age- and sex-matched normal controls. To delineate the brainstem pyramidal tract, tractography was performed using two ROIs, ie, a seed ROI at the cerebral peduncle (ROI-1) and a target ROI at the Lower pons (ROI-2). ROI-1 was subsequently restricted to voxels that contained streamlines in the tract reconstruction, thus creating a sub-ROI. RESULTS Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity values were highly reproducible by tract specific analysis, whereas simple ROI analysis yielded larger variabilities between operators. FA values were significantly tower in ALS patients than in normal controls in the tractography-derived sub-ROI (P =.01), but not in the seed or target ROIs.

METHODS DTI was performed using a single shot SE-EPI with 25 noncollinear diffusion gradient directions (b = 1000 second/mm(2)) and with no diffusion gradient on a 3.0-T MR system in 10 ALS patients and in 8 age- and sex-matched normal controls. To delineate the brainstem pyramidal tract, tractography was performed using two ROIs, ie, a seed ROI at the cerebral peduncle (ROI-1) and a target ROI at the Lower pons (ROI-2). ROI-1 was subsequently restricted to voxels that contained streamlines in the tract reconstruction, thus creating a sub-ROI. RESULTS Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity values were highly reproducible by tract specific analysis, whereas simple ROI analysis yielded larger variabilities between operators. FA values were significantly tower in ALS patients than in normal controls in the tractography-derived sub-ROI (P =.01), but not in the seed or target ROIs. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest, compared with simple ROI analysis, that tract-specific analysis using DTI fiber-tracking is more reliable and sensitive for detecting upper motor neuron pathology in ALS.",Diffusion tensor tractography-based analysis of the pyramidal tract in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2008,18808655,"['DTI', 'EPI']",2.123142251,EPI,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.123142251,"['motor-neuron involvement', 'human brain', 'diffusion tensor magnetic resonance', 'architecture', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'als', 'mri', 'tracking']",als
317,316,"PURPOSE This study aims to assess cerebral metabolites in school-aged autistic patients through proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. METHODS This case-control study included 10 right-handed mate children (median age, 9.53 years +/- 1.80) with autism according to DSM-IV criteria, and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched healthy controls (median age, 8.52 years +/- 1.42). Imaging was performed on a 1.5-T scanner utilizing a single voxel point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) technique (TR = 1,500 ms, TE = 30 ms). Four cerebral areas were evaluated: bilateral anterior cingulate, left striatum, left cerebellar hemisphere, and left frontal lobe. Peak areas and ratios to creatine (Cr) of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and myo-inositol (mI) were analyzed. RESULTS Compared with controls, autistic children showed a significant increase in ml (P = .021) and Cho (P = .042) peak areas in anterior cingulate and in mI/Cr ratio in anterior cingulate (P = .037) and left striatum (P = .035). The remaining metabolites and ratios were not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS This study found a statistically significant increase in myo-inositol and choline in anterior cingulate and left striatum of autistic children compared with controls.

318,317,"Introduction We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study white matter integrity in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods The subjects comprised 20 patients (9 men, 11 women) with FTD and 17 age-matched healthy controls (9 men, 8 women). Based on the data obtained from DTI, we performed tractography of the major cerebral pathways, including the pyramidal tracts, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF) and uncinate fasciculi (UF). We measured the values of fractional anisotropy (FA) in each fiber and statistically compared the findings in patients with those in controls. Results We found a significant decrease in FA values in the selected association fibers as well as anterior fibers of the CC in the patients with FTD. The greatest decrease in mean FA of the UF was seen in advanced FTD. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in FA in the bilateral pyramidal tracts. Conclusion The features of FTD from the view point of cerebral white matter damage were revealed by tractography based on DTI. DTI is therefore considered to be a useful method, and may provide clues to elucidating the pathogenesis of FTD.",Cerebral white matter damage in frontotemporal dementia assessed by diffusion tensor tractography,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2008,18379765,['DTI'],2.135774218,DTI,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.135774218,"['tract', 'diffusion tensor imaging (dti)', 'language', 'anisotropy', 'frontotemporal dementia (ftd)', 'degeneration', 'dementia', 'diagnosis']",dementia
319,318,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the treatment of carotid atherosclerosis, the rate of stenosis and characteristics of plaque should be assessed to diagnose vulnerable plaques that increase the risk for cerebral infarction. We performed carotid black-blood (BB) MR imaging to diagnose plaque components and assess plaque hardness based on MR signals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three images of BB-MR imaging per plaque were obtained from 70 consecutive patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to generate T1- and T2-weighted images. To evaluate the relative signal intensity (rSI) of plaque components and the relationship between histologic findings and symptoms, we prepared sections at 2-mm intervals from 34 intact plaques. We then calculated the relative overall signal intensity (roSI) of 70 plaques to assess the relationship between MR signal intensity and plaque hardness and symptoms. RESULTS: The characteristics of rSI values on T1- and T2-weighted images of fibrous cap (FC), fibrosis, calcification, myxomatous tissue, lipid core (LC) with intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), and LC without IPH differed. Symptomatic plaques were associated with FC disruption (P < .001) and LC with IPH (P < .05). The roSI on T1-weighted images was significantly higher for soft than nonsoft plaques. When the roSI cutoff value was set at 1.25 (mean of the roSI), soft plaques were diagnosed with 79.4% sensitivity and 84.4% specificity. The roSI was also significantly higher for symptomatic than for asymptomatic plaques. Soft and nonsoft plaques as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques did not significantly differ on T2-weighted images. CONCLUSION: BB-MR imaging can diagnose plaque components and predict plaque hardness.

Our aim was to retrospectively compare the accuracy of ASPECTS on noncontrast CT, CT angiography (CTA) source images, and CT perfusion maps of cerebral blood volume (CBV) during the first 3 hours of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First-time patients with MCA stroke who presented <3 hours from symptom onset and were evaluated by noncontrast CT/CTA/CT perfusion, had confirmed acute nonlacunar MCA infarct on diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) within 7 days, and had follow-up angiography were included.

321,320,"Introduction Since digital subtraction angiography (DSA) carries a low risk of morbidity, and is associated with patient discomfort and higher cost, our objective was to determine whether high-resolution 3-D time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) at 3 T may replace DSA in the follow-up of patients after coiling of an intracranial aneurysm. Methods This prospective study included 50 consecutive patients with a ruptured and subsequently coiled intracranial aneurysm. All patients were followed up at a mean of 14 months after coiling with DSA and high-resolution 3-D TOF-MRA at 3 T generating 0.02 mm(3) isotropic voxels. One examiner used DSA and TOF-MR angiograms to assess the need for and risk of retreatment; these data were used to calculate intermodality agreement. Another two examiners independently assessed aneurysm occlusion by DSA and TOF-MRA according to the Raymond scale; these data were used to calculate interobserver agreement. Results Discrepancies between DSA and TOF-MRA were found in three patients (intermodality agreement kappa=0.86). While DSA indicated complete aneurysm occlusion, TOF-MRA showed small neck remnants in the three patients. Coils on all DSA projections obscured these three neck remnants. Interobserver agreement was higher for DSA (kappa=0.82) than for TOF-MRA (kappa=0.68), which was in part due to the complexity of the information provided by TOF source images and reconstructions. Conclusion 3-D TOF-MRA at 3 T is not only an adjunctive tool but is ready to replace DSA in the follow-up of patients with previously coiled intracranial aneurysms. Additional DSA may only be performed in complex and not clearly laid out aneurysms.",Three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography at 3 T compared to digital subtraction angiography in the follow-up of ruptured and coiled intracranial aneurysms: a prospective study,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2008,18196229,['Angiography'],1.906941266,Angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,1.906941266,"['coiling', 'endovascular treatment', 'subarachnoid haemorrhage', 'aneurysm', 'cerebral aneurysms', 'mr angiography', 'guglielmi detachable coils']",hemorrhage
322,321,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to investigate the extent and severity of changes in spinal cord diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters in patients with cervical cord injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI was performed in 20 symptomatic patients (mean, 45.7 +/- 17.7 years of age; 2 women, 18 men) with cervical spine trauma and 8 volunteers mean, 34.2 +/- 10.7 years of age; 6 men, 2 women). The whole cord and regional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), relative anisotropy (RA), and volume ratio (VR) of patients and volunteers were compared. DTI parameters were calculated in 16 patients. MR imaging demonstrated hemorrhagic cord contusions (n = 6), nonhemorrhagic cord contusions (n = 4), and soft-tissue injury (n = 6). Medical records were reviewed for extent of neurologic deficit. RESULTS: Regional ADC values differed significantly between upper and mid and upper and lower (both, P < .004) cervical cord sections. FA was significantly different between upper and lower sections (P < .03). Whole cord ADC values were significantly lower in patients than involunteers (P < .0001). Whole spine FA was not significantly decreased inpatients (P < .06). ADC and FA values were significantly decreased at injury sites when compared with volunteers (P < .031 and .0001, respectively). The greatest differences in whole cord ADC, FA, RA, and VR were in patients with hemorrhagic cord contusions compared with healthy volunteers (P < .0001, .003, .0005, and .008, respectively).

323,322,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the relationship between tumor blood-flow measurement based on perfusion imaging by arterial spin-labeling (ASL-PI) and histopathologic findings in brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ASL-PI to examine 35 patients with brain tumors, including 11 gliomas, 9 meningiomas, 9 schwannomas, 1 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 4 hemangioblastomas, and 1 metastatic brain tumor. As an index of tumor perfusion, the relative signal intensity (SI) of each tumor (%Signal intensity) was determined as a percentage of the maximal SI within the tumor per averaged SI within normal cerebral gray matter on ASL-PI. Relative vascular attenuation (%Vessel) was determined as the total microvessel area per the entire tissue area on CD-34-immunostained histopathologic specimens. MIB1 indices of gliomas were also calculated. The differences in %Signal intensity among different histopathologic types and between high- and low-grade gliomas were compared. In addition, the correlations between %Signal intensity and %Vessel or MIB1 index were evaluated in gliomas. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in %Signal intensity were observed between hemangioblastomas versus gliomas (P < .005), meningionnas (P < .05), and schwannomas (P < .005).

324,323,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glioma angiogenesis and its different hemodynamic features, which can be evaluated by using perfusion CT (PCT) imaging of the brain, have been correlated with the grade and the aggressiveness of gliomas. Our hypothesis was that quantitative estimation of permeability surface area product (PS), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT) in astroglial brain tumors by using PCT will correlate with glioma grade. High-grade gliomas will show higher PS and CBV as compared with low-grade gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCT was performed in 32 patients with previously untreated astroglial tumors (24 high-grade gliomas and 8 low-grade gliomas) by using a total acquisition time of 170 seconds. World Health Organization (WHO) glioma grades were compared with PCT parameter absolute values by using Student or nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were also done for each of the parameters. RESULTS: The differences in PS, CBV, and CBF between the low- and high-grade tumor groups were statistically significant, with the low-grade group showing lower mean values than the high-grade group. ROC analyses showed that both CBV (C-statistic 0.930) and PS (C-statistic 0.927) were very similar to each other in differentiating low- and high-grade gliomas and had higher predictability compared with CBF and MTT.

327,326,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To our knowledge, no published studies have examined whole-brain regional differences to identify more discrete volumetric changes in the brains of childhood leukemia survivors. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine regional gray and white matter differences in a group of long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared with a group of healthy controls. Differences in regional white matter volume were expected, given previous reports of white matter changes during treatment for ALL and reduced brain white matter volumes in long-term survivors. Follow-up analyses examined the relationship of regional brain volumes to cognitive function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 9 long-term survivors of ALL with 14 healthy controls. Survivors of ALL were treated with systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy only, T1 -weighted axial 3D spoiled gradient high-resolution images collected on a 1.5T MR imaging scanner were used for the VBM analysis. Neuropsychological evaluations were conducted within 2 months of the MR imaging to assess cognitive function. RESULTS: VBM analysis revealed 2 specific regions of reduced white matter in the right frontal lobes of survivors of ALL compared with healthy controls. Survivors of ALL had lower performances on tests of attention, visual-constructional skills, mental flexibility, and math achievement compared with healthy individuals. Decreased performance on neuropsychological measures was associated with decreased regional white matter volumes. No differences were found between the groups with respect to gray matter regions. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with previous literature describing the long-term cognitive, academic, and imaging findings of survivors of ALL and suggest that right frontal white matter is particularly vulnerable to disruption following intensive chemotherapy for ALL.

330,329,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiating between primary cerebral lymphoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) based on conventional MR imaging sequences may be impossible. Our hypothesis was that there are significant differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between lymphoma and GBM, which will allow for differentiation between them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative diffusion tenser imaging (DTI) was performed in 10 patients with lymphoma and 10 patients with GBM. Regions of interest were placed in only solid-enhancing tumor areas and the contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) to measure the FA and ADC values. The differences in FA and ADC between lymphoma and GBM, as well as between solid-enhancing areas of each tumor type and contralateral NAWM, were analyzed statistically. Cutoff values of FA, FA ratio, ADC, and ADC ratio for distinguishing lymphomas from GBMs were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: FA and ADC values of lymphoma were significantly decreased compared with NAWM. Mean FA, FA ratio, ADC (X 10(-3) mm(2)/s), and ADC ratios were 0.140 +/- 0.024, 0.25 +/- 0.04, 0.630 +/- 0.155, and 0.83 +/- 0.14 for lymphoma, respectively, and 0.229 +/- 0.069, 0.40 +/- 0.12, 0.963 +/- 0.119, and 1.26 +/- 0.13 for GBM, respectively. All of the values were significantly different between lymphomas and GBM. Cutoff values to differentiate lymphomas from GBM were 0.192 for FA, 0.33 for FA ratio, 0.818 for ADC, and 1.06 for ADC ratio.

331,330,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowledge of the anatomic basis of aphasia after stroke has both theoretic and clinical implications by informing models of cortical connectivity and providing data for diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we use diffusion tensor imaging to address the relationship between damage to specific white matter tracts and linguistic deficits after left hemisphere stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients aged 38-77 years with a history of stroke in the left hemisphere underwent diffusion tensor imaging, structural MR imaging, and language testing. All of the patients were premorbidly right handed and underwent imaging and language testing at least 1 month after stroke. RESULTS: Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the superior longitudinal and arcuate fasciculi of the left hemisphere, an indication of greater damage to these tracts, were correlated with decreased ability to repeat spoken language. Comprehension deficits after stroke were associated with lower FA values in the arcuate fasciculus of the left hemisphere. The findings for repetition were independent of MR imaging ratings of the degree of damage to cortical areas of the left hemisphere involved in language function. There were no findings for homotopic tracts in the right hemisphere.

332,331,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolization of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is commonly used to achieve nidal volume reduction before microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the overall neurologic complication rate in patients undergoing AVM embolization and analyze the factors that may determine increased risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with brain AVMs embolized at 1 center from 1995 through 2005. Demographics, including age, sex, presenting symptoms, and clinical condition, were recorded. Angiographic factors including maximal nidal size, presence of deep venous drainage, and involvement of eloquent cortex were also recorded. For each embolization session, the agent used, number of pedicles embolized, the percentage of nidal obliteration, and any complications were recorded. Complications were classified as the following: none, non-neurologic (mild), transient neurologic deficit, and permanent nondisabling and permanent disabling deficits. The permanent complications were also classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were collected pre- and postembolization on all patients. Univariate regression analysis of factors associated with the development of any neurologic complication was performed. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-nine embolization procedures were performed in 192 patients. There were 6 Spetzler-Martin grade I (3.1%), 26 grade II (13.5%), 71 grade III (37.0%), 57 grade IV (29.7%), and 32 grade V (16.7%) AVMs. Permanent nondisabling complications occurred in 5 patients (2.6%) and permanent disabling complications or deaths occurred in 3 (1.6%). In addition, there were non-neurologic complications in 4 patients (2.1%) and transient neurologic deficits in 22 (11.5%). Five of the 8 permanent complications (2.6% overall) were ischemic, and 3 of 8 (1.6% overall) were hemorrhagic. Of the 178 patients who were mRS 0-2 pre-embolization, 4 (2.3%) were dependent or dead (mRS >2) at follow-up. Univariate analysis of risk factors for permanent neurologic deficits following embolization showed that basal ganglia location was weakly associated with a new postembolization neurologic deficit.

333,332,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Noninvasive diagnosis of brain lesions is important for the correct choice of treatment. Our aims were to investigate whether 1) proton MR spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI) can aid in differentiating between tumors and nonneoplastic brain lesions, and 2) perfusion MR imaging can improve the classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined 69 adults with untreated primary brain lesions (brain tumors, n = 36; benign lesions, n = 10; stroke, n = 4; demyelination, n = 10; and stable lesions not confirmed on pathologic examination, n = 9). MR imaging and 1H-MRSI were performed at 1.5T before biopsy or treatment. Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and choline (Cho) in the lesion were expressed as metabolite ratios and were normalized to the contralateral hemisphere. Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging was performed in a subset of patients (n = 32); relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was evaluated. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify variables that can predict inclusion in the neoplastic or nonneoplastic lesion groups. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the discriminatory capability of H-1-MRSI and perfusion MR imaging. RESULTS: The discriminant function analysis correctly classified 84.2% of original grouped cases (P <.0001), on the basis of NAA/Cho, Cho(norm.) NAA(norm,) and NAA/Cr ratios. MRSI and perfusion MR imaging had similar discriminatory capabilities in differentiating tumors from nonneoplastic lesions. With cutoff points of NAA/Cho <= 0.61 and rCBV >= 1.50 (corresponding to diagnosis of the tumors), a sensitivity of 72.2% and specificity of 91.7% in differentiating tumors from nonneoplastic lesions were achieved.

Two neuroradiologists read the images regarding the number of lesions seen on each sequence. The final decisions were reached by consensus. The number of lesions on the different sequences was compared with analysis of variance, followed by a nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. RESULTS: The number of lesions was higher on T2-weighted GBE than on T2-weighted FSE (P =.001).

337,336,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nonalcoholic Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is prone to be underestimated in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to improve its awareness and early accurate diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the cases of 12 patients with nonalcoholic WE, consisting of clinical characteristics and MR imaging features as well as follow-up after administration of thiamine. RESULTS: Patients with mild coma or lethargy (7/12) exhibited typical MR features of symmetric brain paraventricular damage. Patients without disturbances of consciousness or who only had drowsiness (3/12) exhibited a lesion of the periaqueductal area only. In addition to typical MR manifestations, symmetric cortical involvement was observed in 2 of 12 patients with deep coma. Gadolinum enhancement of the mammillary bodies was observed in 2 of 3 patients. No atrophy of the mammillary bodies and cerebellar vermis was found in any patients. Of 10 patients without deep coma and cortical damage, 2 missed the follow-up and 8, who recovered clinically, also showed accordant resolution of abnormal hyperintense signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images within 2 weeks to 1 year after thiamine supplementation. Two patients with deep coma and cortical damage showed a poor prognosis:1 patient died 15 days after being diagnosed with WE, and the other entered a persistent vegetative state during a follow-up of 2 years. CONCLUSION: Typical symmetric damage of the mammillary bodies and brain paraventricular regions may permit a specific diagnosis of nonalcoholic WE.

339,338,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many theories of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) stress the importance of ischemia in the deep white matter. Alternate theories stress a reduction in superficial venous compliance and changes in pulse-wave propagation. An overlap in the cerebral blood flow volumes measured between NPH and controls suggests that ischemia may not be a prerequisite for this condition. This study sought to compare blood flow and compliance measures in a cohort of patients with NPH selected for having arterial inflows above the normal range to see if deep brain ischemia or superficial hemodynamic changes contribute to the pathophysiology of NPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with NPH and arterial inflows above the normal range were selected. They underwent MR imaging with flow quantification measuring the total blood inflow, sagittal/straight sinus outflow, aqueduct stroke volume, and arteriovenous delay (AVD). Patients were compared with 12 age-matched controls. RESULTS: The deep outflow volumes were normal. The superficial venous outflow was reduced as a percentage of the inflow by 9% (P =.04). The sagittal sinus compliance as measured by the AVD was reduced by 50% (P =.0001), and the aqueduct stroke volume was elevated by 192% (P =.02). CONCLUSION: Ischemia in the deep venous territory is not a prerequisite for NPH. Patients with high-inflow NPH show alterations in superficial venous compliance and a reduction in the blood flow returning via the sagittal sinus.

When patients with basilar occlusion were excluded, the presence of VA occlusion (OR 6.5, 95% CI, 1.34-31.4), age (OR 1.09, 95% CI, 1.03-1.14), and baseline NIHSS (OR 1.1, 95% CI, 1.03-1.18) predicted poorer outcome.

341,340,"BACKGROUND The diagnosis of small deep infarcts (SDIs) based on clinical and noncontrast CT findings is often employed to triage stroke patients for emergent endovascular interventions. Few studies have evaluated the accuracy of < 6 hours presentation with lacunar clinical syndromes in predicting the presence of a SDI and the absence of large vessel occlusion. METHODS Consecutive patients were identified with symptoms suggestive of acute stroke, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and CT performed within 6 hours of onset, and absence of hemorrhage on imaging. Patients were given a diagnosis of SDI if they met the defined clinical and CT criteria. Diagnoses of large vessel occlusion absent (LVOA) and final diagnoses of SDI versus non-SDI incorporated hyperacute multimodal MRI data. RESULTS Of 64 patients, 15 were diagnosed as SDI at < 6 hours based on clinical/CT criteria. Fourteen of 15 patients (93%) had a final diagnosis of LVOA.

342,341,"Introduction An automated procedure for the detection, quantification, localization and statistical mapping of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images is presented and validated based on the results of a between-centre reproducibility study. Methods The first step is the identification of white matter (WM) tissue using a multispectral (T1, T2, PD) segmentation. In a second step, WMH are identified within the WM tissue by segmenting T2 images, isolating two different classes of WMH voxels-low- and high-contrast WMH voxels, respectively. The reliability of the whole procedure was assessed by applying it to the analysis of two large MR imaging databases (n = 650 and n = 710, respectively) of healthy elderly subjects matched for demographic characteristics. Results Average overall WMH load and spatial distribution were found to be similar in the two samples, (1.81 and 1.79% of the WM volume, respectively). White matter hyperintensity load was found to be significantly associated with both age and high blood pressure, with similar effects in both samples. With specific reference to the 650 subject cohort, we also found that WMH load provided by this automated procedure was significantly associated with visual grading of the severity of WMH, as assessed by a trained neurologist. Conclusion The results show that this method is sensitive, well correlated with semi-quantitative visual rating and highly reproducible.","An automated procedure for the assessment of white matter hyperintensities by multispectral (T1, T2, PD) MRI and an evaluation of its between-centre reproducibility based on two large community databases",NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2008,17938898,['MRI'],1.983218917,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,1.983218917,"['blood-pressure', 'brain mri', 'hypertension', 'reproducibility', 't2 mri', 'aging', 'white matter', 'elderly individuals', 'image registration']",aging
343,342,"Introduction We report an in vitro study comparing the effectiveness of clot removal and clot fragmentation of five embolectomy systems. Methods A flow model was embolized with fresh and old thrombi, occluding an inner diameter of 2-5 mm simulating internal carotid artery (ICA), basilar artery (BA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) branch occlusion. Embolectomy was performed using five retrieval systems: CATCH (Balt), Merci retriever (Concentric), InTime and Attracter (Boston Scientific), and the Phenox Clot Retriever (Phenox). Clot removal and evidence and type of thrombus fragmentation and distal embolization were recorded. Results There were no observable differences attributable to thrombus age. The Merci, CATCH and Phenox Clot Retriever were equally able to mobilize and remove thrombi with the exception of one particularly firm clot. There were marked differences in terms of thrombus fragmentation and distal embolization. All devices produced micro- and macrofragments during penetration and retrieval. The Phenox Clot Retriever was able to filter fragments. The InTime and Attracter devices failed to retrieve thrombi in this model and achieved partial removal at best with a tendency towards thrombus displacement and fragmentation. Conclusion Within limits, the experimental setup was appropriate for generating occlusions of diameter 2-5 mm of various lengths, simulating ICA, BA and MCA thromboembolism. In this model, thrombus mobilization appeared to be less dependent upon the individual design of the retrieval system than on thrombus fragmentation. The ability to prevent distal embolization is, however, strongly dependent on the ability of a thrombectomy device to capture fragments that are generated during removal of the device.",Comparative in vitro study of five mechanical embolectomy systems: effectiveness of clot removal and risk of distal embolization,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2008,17932666,['angiography'],2.440884821,angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.440884821,"['ischemic-stroke', 'thrombectomy', 'acute stroke', 'ischemia', 'tissue-plasminogen activator', 'stroke', 'endovascular', 'embolectomy']",stroke

ACT was performed after the interventional procedure to analyze stent position and the relationship of coils to the stent. Postprocessing included multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) and maximum intensity projections (MIPs), ACT volume datasets were postprocessed for soft tissue visualization. RESULTS: Accurate stent placement with subsequent coil occlusion of the aneurysms was feasible in all of the patients.

346,345,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can noninvasively quantify white matter (WM) integrity. Although its application in adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common, few studies in children have been reported. The purposes of this study were to examine the alteration of fractional anisotropy (FA) in children with TBI experienced during early childhood and to quantify the association between FA and injury severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FA was assessed in 9 children with TBI (age = 7.89 +/- 1.00 years; Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] = 10.11 +/- 4.68) and a control group of 12 children with orthopedic injuries without central nervous system involvement (age = 7.51 +/- 0.95 years). All of the subjects were at minimum 12 months after injury. We examined group differences in a series of predetermined WM regions of interest with t test analysis. We subsequently conducted a voxel-wise comparison with Spearman partial correlation analysis. Correlations between FA and injury severity were also calculated on a voxel-wise basis. RESULTS: FA values were significantly reduced in the TBI group in genu of corpus callosum (CC), posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFO), and centrum semiovale (CS). GCS scores were positively correlated with FA in several WM areas including CC, PLIC, SLF, CS, SFO, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO).

Multiplanar T2-and TI-weighted imaging was followed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Isotropic diffusion-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and color-coded fractional anisotropy maps, including tractography, were subsequently calculated. RESULTS: In all 6 patients studied, DTI showed that the fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncles did not decussate in the mesencephalon and the corticospinal tract failed to cross in the caudal medulla.

Four radiologists independently reviewed CT images, and 2 other radiologists reviewed DSA images. Aneurysm diameter (D), neck width (N), and the presence of a branch arising from the sac were assessed. RESULTS: DSA revealed 67 aneurysms in 48 patients and no aneurysm in 6 patients. Mean sensitivity and specificity of CTA for the detection of intracranial aneurysms were, respectively, 94% and 90.2%. For aneurysms less than 3 mm, CTA had a mean sensitivity of 70.4%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCT was performed in 19 patients with glioma (14 high-grade gliomas and 5 low-grade gliomas). Normalized ratios of the PCT parameters (normalized cerebral blood volume [nCBV], normalized cerebral blood flow [nCBF], normalized mean transit time [nMTT]) were used for final analysis. Conventional MR imaging features of these tumors were assessed separately and compared with PCT parameters. Low- and high-grade gliomas were compared by using the nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample tests. RESULTS: Mean nCBV in the high- and low-grade gliomas was 3.06 +/- 1.35 and 1.44 +/- 0.42, respectively, with a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P =.005).

An nCBV threshold of > 1.92 was found to identify the high-grade gliomas.",Role of perfusion CT in glioma grading and comparison with conventional MR imaging features,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17893216,"['CT', 'MRP']",2.113702624,MRP,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.113702624,"['cerebral blood-volume', 'vascular-permeability', 'glial', 'brain-tumors']",tumor
350,349,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging features of metronidazole-incluced encephalopathy (MIE) have not been fully established. This study was undertaken to determine the topographic distributions and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings of MIE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the initial MR images (n = 7), including DWI (n=5), and follow-up MR images (n = 4) after drug discontinuation in 7 patents with clinically diagnosed MIE. The topographic distributions of lesions were evaluated on MR images, and DWI signal intensities and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the lesions were assessed. RESULTS: MR images demonstrated bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintense lesions in the cerebellar dentate nucleus (n = 7), midbrain n = 7), dorsal pons (n = 6), medulla (n = 4), corpus callosurn (n = 4), and cerebral white matter (n = 1). Brain stem lesions involved the following: tectum (n = 5), tegmentum (n = 4), red nucleus (n = 3) of the midbrain, vestibular nucleus (n = 6), and a focal tegmental lesion involving the superior olivary nucleus (n = 6) and abducens nucleus (n = 4) of the pons and vestibular nucleus (n = 4) and inferior olivary nucleus (n = 1) of the medulla. DWI (n = 5) showed isointensity or hyperintensity of lesions, and the decreased ADC value was found only in the corpus callosum lesions (n = 2). All detected lesions were completely reversible at follow-up except for the single corpus callosum lesion with an initial low ADC value. CONCLUSION: Brain lesions were typically located at the cerebellar dentate nucleus, midbrain, dorsal pons, medulla, and splenium of the corpus callosum. According to DWI, most of the lesions in MIE probably corresponded to areas of vasogenic edema, whereas only some of them, located in the corpus callosum, corresponded to cytotoxic edema.",MR imaging of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy: Lesion distribution and diffusion-weighted imaging findings,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17885234,['DTI'],2.332361516,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.332361516,"['corpus-callosum', 'cerebellar lesions', 'splenial', 'wernickes encephalopathy']",tumor
351,350,"Background and purpose: Clinical indications of giant cell arteritis may be unspecific, and noninvasive diagnosis is often difficult. This study investigated the hypothesis that high-resolution MR imaging of the superficial cranial arteries is a noninvasive imaging technique that can detect the occurrence of giant cell arteritis. Materials and Methods: Contrast-enhanced, high-resolution MR imaging was performed on 64 consecutive patients with suspected giant cell arteritis, Mural thickness, lumen diameter, and a mural contrast enhancement score were assessed with T1-weighted spin-echo images with submillimeter in-plane spatial resolution. The final rheumatologist's diagnosis according to the clinical criteria of the American College of Rheumatology including laboratory tests and results of temporal artery biopsies from 32 patients was used as a ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of the MR imaging findings. Results: All of the examinations provided diagnostic image quality. Evaluation of the mural inflammatory MR imaging signs for diagnosing vasculitis resulted in a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 97.0%. In comparison, histology results alone showed a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 100%. The mean wall thickness increased significantly from 0.39 mm (+/- 0.18 mm) to 0.74 mm (+/- 0.32 mm; P < .001), and the lumen diameter decreased significantly from 0.84 mm (+/- 0.29 mm) to 0.65 mm (+/- 0.38 mm; P < .05) for patients with giant cell arteritis. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced, high-resolution MR imaging allows noninvasive assessment of mural inflammation in giant cell arteritis with good diagnostic certainty.

354,353,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to derive regional cerebral blood flow using vessel flows from quantitative MR angiography (qMRA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Flow rates in the 15 major cerebral arteries were measured on retrospectively gated fast 2D phase-contrast MR angiography obtained in 83 healthy adult volunteers (age range, 24-74 years; mean, 42 years). The arterial network of the brain was partitioned into 12 different regions, in which flows were calculated from the measured flows of the 15 cerebral arteries. RESULTS: The mean flows of the 15 arteries and the 12 regions were calculated. The mean total cranial flow and the mean total cerebral blood flow were 949 +/- 158 mL/min and 695 +/- 113 ML/min, respectively. The mean regional flows for the anterior and posterior circulation were 483 +/- 87 mL/min and 212 +/- 34 mL/min, respectively. The relative contributions of the flows in the 11 regions to their parent regions were obtained. The mean flows in the individual arteries and the regions with age were also calculated. The mean flows for the female group were significantly lower than those for the male group (P <.001) for the 2 common carotids and the cranial circulation and left/right extracranial circulation. However, the intracranial circulation was not different between sexes.

355,354,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to improve our understanding of the subinsular white matter microstructural asymmetries in healthy right-handed subjects. Structural brain asymmetries could be related to functional asymmetries such as hemisphere language dominance or handedness. Besides the known gray matter asymmetries, white matter asymmetries could also play a key role in the understanding of hemispheric specialization, notably that of language, MATERIALS AND METHODS: White matter asymmetries were studied by diffusion tensor imaging at 1.5T (41 diffusion-gradient directions; b-value set to 700 S/mm(2); matrix, 1282; in-plane resolution, 1.875 X 1.875 mm; section thickness, 2.0 mm) and fiber tracking (BrainVISA software). The main white matter bundles passing through the subinsular area were segmented, and fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured along each of the segmented bundles. RESULTS: In line with published results, we found an asymmetry of the arcuate fasciculus and the subinsular white matter, namely eft-greater-than-right FA in right-handed controls. Furthermore, by segmenting major tracts coursing through this region, we showed that the subinsular portions of the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus (IOF) contribute to this FA asymmetry. Those tracts have been reported to be likely implicated in the language network. CONCLUSION: Because the left hemisphere hosts language functions in most right-handers, the significant leftward asymmetry observed within the arcuate fasciculus, the subinsular part of the UF and IOF may be related to the hemispheric specialization for language.",Human subinsular asymmetry studied by diffusion tensor Imaging and fiber tracking,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17846205,['DTI'],1.967930029,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.967930029,"['uncinate fasciculus', 'white matter', 'human-brain', 'connectivity']",wm

357,356,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The management of intracranial pseudoaneurysms is controversial. The purpose of this study was to provide a preliminary evaluation of the clinical efficacy of a Willis covered stent specially designed for the intracranial vasculature in the management of a pseudoaneurysm of the cranial internal carotid artery (CICA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients with pseudoaneurysms of the CICA were treated with use of the Willis covered stent. The flexibility of the entire stent system was gauged from the resistance met when reaching the target lesion and was categorized as no resistance, no apparent resistance, or resistance that could be overcome. The apposition of the Willis stent after deployment was scored as excellent with no endoleak, good with a small endoleak, or bad with an apparent endoleak. Follow-up angiography was performed 3 to 12 months after placement of the stent, and angiographic assessments were categorized as endoleak, stenosis of the covered segment of vessel, or occlusion of parent arteries. Follow-up clinical evaluations were also performed, and outcomes were graded as full recovery, improvement, unchanged, and aggravation. RESULTS: Endovascular treatment was technically successful in all aneurysms without procedural-related complications, and all of the stents were easily navigated to the targeted lesions in the CICA. Complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm was observed in 6 patients immediately after the procedure, and a minimal endoleak into the aneurysm persisted in 2 patients. No morbidity or mortality and no technical adverse event occurred. A follow-up angiogram confirmed complete reconstruction of the internal carotid artery, with no recurrent aneurysmal filling and no occurrence of stenosis in the area of the stent. By the final follow-up visit, 4 patients had fully recovered, 3 had improved, and 1 patient's condition was unchanged.

359,358,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ulceration is a severe complication of carotid plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and the diagnostic efficacy of multidetector row CT angiography (MDCTA) and ultrasound (US) echo color Doppler (US-ECD) in the study of patients with carotid plaque complicated by ulceration through the comparison with the surgical observation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to October 2005, 237 patients, for a total of 474 carotid arteries, studied at first with color Doppler US, were analyzed using CT angiography. A total of 103 patients underwent a carotid endarterectomy. We analyzed stenosis degree, plaque composition, and presence of ulcerations. In a second phase, the data were compared with the surgical results when the MDCTA indicated surgical intervention. RESULTS: MDCTA found 31 ulcerations; the surgical confirmation underlined a 93.75% sensitivity and a 98.59% specificity. US-ECD performances were 37.5% and 91.5% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The number of patients who showed plaque ulcerations increased with the severity of stenosis. Furthermore, ulcerations of the carotid plaque occurred more often proximal than distal to the point of maximum stenosis, and this trend increased with the severity of the stenosis.

359,358,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ulceration is a severe complication of carotid plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and the diagnostic efficacy of multidetector row CT angiography (MDCTA) and ultrasound (US) echo color Doppler (US-ECD) in the study of patients with carotid plaque complicated by ulceration through the comparison with the surgical observation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to October 2005, 237 patients, for a total of 474 carotid arteries, studied at first with color Doppler US, were analyzed using CT angiography. A total of 103 patients underwent a carotid endarterectomy. We analyzed stenosis degree, plaque composition, and presence of ulcerations. In a second phase, the data were compared with the surgical results when the MDCTA indicated surgical intervention. RESULTS: MDCTA found 31 ulcerations; the surgical confirmation underlined a 93.75% sensitivity and a 98.59% specificity. US-ECD performances were 37.5% and 91.5% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The number of patients who showed plaque ulcerations increased with the severity of stenosis. Furthermore, ulcerations of the carotid plaque occurred more often proximal than distal to the point of maximum stenosis, and this trend increased with the severity of the stenosis. We also determined that fatty plaques were more likely to be affected by ulcerations.

The purpose of our study was to determine whether the peak height and the percentage of signal intensity recovery derived from dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced QSQ perfusion MR imaging could differentiate GBM and MET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with histopathologic diagnosis of GBM (n = 27) or MET In = 16) underwent DSC perfusion MR imaging in addition to anatomic MR imaging before surgery. Regions of interest were drawn around the nonenhancing periturnoral T2 lesion (PTL) and the contrast-enhancing lesion (CEL). T2* signal intensity-time curves acquired during the first pass of gadolinium contrast material were converted to the changes in relaxation rate to yield T2* relaxivity (Delta R2*) curve. The peak height of maximal signal intensity drop and the percentage of signal intensity recovery at the end of first pass were measured for each voxel in the PTL and CEL regions of the tumor. RESULTS: The average peak height for the PTL was significantly higher (P =.04) in GBM than in MET. The average percentage of signal intensity recovery was significantly reduced in PTL (78.4% versus 82.8%; P =.02) and in CEL (62.5% versus 80.9%, P <.01) regions of MET compared with those regions in the GBM group.

361,360,"Introduction Sinus pericranii (SP) is a rare, usually asymptomatic condition characterized by a large communication between the intra- and the extracranial venous drainage pathways in which blood may circulate bidirectionally through dilated veins of the skull. We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic experience with SP, with a special focus on the vascular analysis of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Methods DSA images of 15 patients were evaluated with regard to the delay in opacification of the scalp vessels, the absence or distortion of the superficial cortical veins in the vicinity of the SP, the drainage patterns of the superior sagittal sinus, and the degree of maturation of the venous outlets of the brain. SP were classified either as ""dominant"", if the main stream of contrast flow used the SP to drain the brain bypassing usual venous outlets, or as ""accessory"", if only a small part of the venous outflow occurred through the extradiploic vessels. Results All patients presented with a nonpulsatile, soft-tissue mass. The lesion was on the midline in 14 of 15 patients, frontal in 12 patients, and parietal in 2 patients. In 13 patients, associated intracranial venous anomalies were present, eight of which were developmental venous anomalies. Seven patients had a dominant SP, and eight an accessory SP. Conclusion SP can be considered the cutaneous sign of an underlying venous anomaly. If treatment is contemplated, analysis of the drainage pattern of the SP has to be performed. Treatment should be avoided in dominant SP or if its accessory role constitutes the only collateral pathway of an underlying venous anomaly.",Sinus pericranii: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in 15 patients,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17285338,['Angiography'],1.895734597,Angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,1.895734597,"['venous malformation', 'venous angioma', 'developmental venous anomaly', 'sinus pericranii']",tumor
362,361,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the method of reference for imaging of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). The goal of this study was to analyze the value of different MR images including 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) with a high temporal resolution in diagnostic and follow-up imaging of DAVFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 18 MR/MRA examinations from 14 patients with untreated (n = 9) and/or treated (n = 9) DAVFs were evaluated. Two observers assessed all MR and MRA investigations for signs indicating the presence of a DAVF, for fistula characteristics such as fistula grading, location of fistulous point, and fistula obliteration after treatment. All results were compared with DSA findings. RESULTS: On time-resolved 3D contrast-enhanced (TR 3D) MRA, the side and presence of all patent fistulas (n = 13) were correctly indicated, and no false-positive findings were observed in occluded DAVFs (n = 5). Grading of fistulas with this imaging technique was correct in 77% and 85% of patent fistulas for both readers, respectively. On T2-weighted images, signs indicative of a DAVF were encountered only in fistulas with cortical venous reflux (56%), whereas on 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA, most fistulas (88%) were correctly detected. In complete fistula occlusion, false-positive findings were encountered on both T2-weighted images and on TOF MRA images. CONCLUSION: In this study, TR 3D MRA proved reliable in detecting DAVFs and suitable for follow-up imaging. The technique allowed-within limitations-to grade DAVFs. Although 3D TOF MRA can depict signs of DAVFs, its value for follow-up imaging is limited.",MR angiography of dural arteriovenous fistulas: Diagnosis and follow-up after treatment using a time-resolved 3D contrast-enhanced technique,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17494662,['Angiography'],2.113702624,Angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.113702624,"['vascular', 'digital-subtraction-angiography', 'venous drainage']",DAVF

The characterization of vasospasm severity by MSCTA showed a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86.8%, 96.8%, and 95.2%, respectively, for mild-moderate vasospasm, and 76.5%, 99.5%, and 97.5%, respectively, for severe vasospasm. The PCT abnormalities were related to severe vasospasm in 9 patients and to mild-to-mode rate vasospasm in 2. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PCT in detecting vasospasm were 90%, 100%, and 92.3%, respectively, for severe vasospasm, and 20%, 100%, and 38.5%, respectively, for mild-moderate vasospasm. CONCLUSION: MSCTA/PCT can assess the location and severity of cerebrovascular vasospasm and its related perfusion abnormalities.

369,368,"Background and Purpose: We prospectively evaluated the safety of aggressive mechanical disruption of thrombus following full-dose intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to treat ischemic stroke in 24 patients with an initial National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score of >= 10. Methods: Clinical evaluations were performed at presentation and 24 hours, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months (using modified Rankin scale) after treatment. These end points were compared to matched historical controls treated with IV rt-PA alone. Results: Of the 24 patients, mechanical disruption was undertaken in 17 patients with persistent angiographic occlusion using microcatheter exploration (n = 3), angioplasty (n = 5), snare maneuvers (n = 7), and combination of both (n = 2). Partial or complete recanalization was observed in 10 of the 17 patients. Neurological improvement at 24 hours (>= 4 point reduction in NIHSS score) was observed in 11 of 17 patients. Comparisons with matched controls suggest potential equivalence for symptomatic ICH (0% vs 12%), asymptomatic ICH (18% vs 15%), and early neurological improvement (65% vs 53%). Conclusion: The study shows that aggressive mechanical thrombus disruption in large artery occlusion in the setting of acute ischemic stroke is safe with acceptable rates of ICH and promotes angiographic recanalization.",Mechanical disruption of thrombus following intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for ischemic stroke,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2007,17441833,['angiography'],2.256944444,angiography,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.256944444,"['clot disruption', 'therapy', 'recanalization', 'intraarterial thrombolysis']",thrombosis
370,369,"Background and Purpose. This study investigated the association of medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy and cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH], subclinical infarcts) with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) among cognitively normal older adults. Methods. Risk of developing AD was examined for 155 cognitively normal older adults (77.4 years, 60% women, 81% white). The MTL volumes and the presence of WMH and of subclinical infarcts were determined from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the beginning of the study. Follow-up cognitive evaluations (average 4.3 years) identified those who developed AD. Results. The presence of either MTL atrophy or subclinical infarcts was independently and significantly associated with a greater risk to develop AD (OR [95% CI]: 4.4 [1.5, 12.3] and 2.7 [1.0, 7.1], respectively). In addition, those participants with both MTL atrophy and at least one brain infarct had a 7-fold increase in the risk of developing AD (OR [95% CI]: 7.0 [1.5, 33.1]), compared to those who had neither of these conditions. Conclusions. In cognitively normal older adults, markers of neurodegeneration (as reflected by MTL atrophy) and of cerebrovascular disease (as reflected by infarcts on MRI) independently contribute to the risk to develop AD.",Focal atrophy and cerebrovascular disease increase dementia risk among cognitively normal older adults,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2007,17441836,['MRI'],2.083333333,MRI,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.083333333,"['cardiovascular', 'focal atrophy', 'temporal-lobe atrophy', 'white matter', 'depression', 'hyperintensity']",depression

372,371,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The underlying changes in the neuronal connectivity adjacent to brain tumors cannot always be depicted by conventional MR imaging. The hypothesis of this study was that preoperative sensorimotor deficits are associated with impairment in pyramidal fiber bundles. Hence, we investigated the potential of combined quantitative diffusion tensor (DT) fiber tracking and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to determine changes in the pyramidal tract adjacent to gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative DT fiber tracking and proton MRSI were performed in 20 patients with gliomas with WHO grades II-IV. Eight patients experienced preoperative sensorimotor deficits. Mean diffusivity (MID), fractional anisotropy (FA), and number of fibers per voxel (FpV) were calculated for the pyramidal tract of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere. Metabolite concentrations for choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were computed, using LCModel, for all voxels located at the pyramidal tracts. RESULTS: For the whole pyramidal tract, quantitative IDT fiber tracking resulted in significantly lower FpV and FA values (P <.001), but not MID values, for the ipsilateral hemisphere. For the section of the fiber bundle closest to the lesion, we found significantly decreased FpV and FA (P <.001) and increased MD (P =.002). MRSI showed, for the same volumes of interest, significantly decreased NAA (P =.001), increased Cho (P =.034) and Cho/NAA (P =.001) for the ipsilateral pyramidal tract. In patients suffering sensorimotor deficits, we found significantly lower FA (P =.022) and higher MD values (P =.026) and a strongly negative correlation between FA and MID (R = -0.710, P =.024) but no correlation in patients without deficits (R = 0.078, ns). CONCLUSION: Quantitative DTI was able to show significant differences in diffusivity of the pyramidal tract in patients with sensorimotor deficits in relation to patients without them. The additional use of proton MRSI may be helpful to discern whether these diffusivity changes in fiber tracts are caused by tumor infiltration or peritumoral edema.","Changes in fiber integrity, diffusivity, and metabolism of the pyramidal tract adjacent to gliomas: A quantitative diffusion tensor fiber tracking and MR spectroscopic imaging study",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17353313,['DTI'],1.895043732,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.895043732,"['human brain', 'white matter', 'localized', 'magnetic-resonance spectroscopy']",wm
373,372,"BACKGROUND: Previously, endovascular treatment of wide-necked aneurysms and stenosis involving small vessels measuring < 2 mm in diameter was limited. There are no reports in the literature addressing stent placement in small distal cerebral vessels. Recent experience with the Neuroform stent has shown that this device can be safely and effectively used to treat aneurysms in vessels of this caliber. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report 8 cases of Neuroform stent placement into cerebral vessels measuring < 2 mm in diameter (range, 1.1-1.8 mm). All stents were placed for aneurysm treatment in conjunction with coiling. Lesion locations and number were as follows: anterior communicating artery region (n = 5), pericallosal artery A2-A3 (n = 1), middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1-M2 (n 1), and MCA M3-M4 (n = 1). Clinical follow-up ranged from 4.5 to 18 months. Imaging follow-up was performed with MR imaging/MR angiography. RESULTS: All procedures were successfully performed without immediate or delayed device-related complications. Intraprocedural thrombus developed within the stent in 2 patients and immediately resolved with 10 mg of intra-arterial abciximab. Follow-up at 18 months demonstrated durable results. There were no clinical neurologic symptoms related to the treated vessel territory at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Development of newer low-profile endovascular devices allows access and ability to treat lesions farther out in the smaller cerebral vessels. We have safely and successfully treated 8 vessels smaller than 2 mm in diameter with newer self-expanding stents with good short- and intermediate-term results. Further follow-up and more experience are necessary to determine long-term results.",Use of self-expanding stents in distal small cerebral vessels,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17353331,['Angiography'],1.822157434,Angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.822157434,"['neuroform', 'aneurysms', 'coil embolization']",aneurysms
374,373,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent evidence from neuropsychologic and neuroimaging studies suggests that central nervous system involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) extends beyond motor neurons. Our purpose was to obtain measures of global and regional atrophy in nondemented patients with ALS to assess subtle structural brain changes. METHODS: MR images, acquired from 16 patients and 9 healthy subjects (HS), were processed by using the Structural Imaging Evaluation of Normalized Atrophy (SIENA) software to estimate wholebrain atrophy measures and the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method to highlight the selective volumetric decrease of single cerebral areas. In addition, each subject underwent a neuropsychologic examination. RESULTS: In patients with ALS, brain parenchymal fraction was slightly lower compared with HS (P = .012), and seemed to be related to the presence of cognitive impairment. Patients showed a gray matter volume decrease in several frontal and temporal areas bilaterally (P < .001 uncorrected) compared with HS, with a slight prevalence in the right hemisphere. No volume reduction in primary motor cortices of patients was detected. Performances on Symbol Digit Modalities Test were significantly worse in patients compared with HS (P = .025).

375,374,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies have reported abnormal changes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by histogram and region-of-interest-based methods by using diffusion tenor imaging. However, there are few studies on specific white matter fiber tracts of BBMS. Our study sought to use diffusion tensor tractography-based group mapping to investigate the presence of abnormal diffusion in the normal-appearing pyramidal tract (PYT) of BBMS and its possible mechanism. METHODS: A PYT probability map was first constructed from data on 20 healthy patients based on the deterministic-based tractography method. The PYT probability map was then applied to 29 RRMS patients to calculate diffusion indices of the PYT. In this study, 4 quantitative indices-fractional anisotropy (FA), directionally averaged diffusion coefficient (D-av), axial diffusion coefficient (lambda(1)), and radial diffusion coefficient (lambda(23))-were used to characterize the abnormal diffusion. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, RRMS patients had a significantly higher D-av and lambda(23) but a lower FA and a trend toward a lower lambda(1) in the normal-appearing PYT. In RRMS patients, PYT lesions had a significantly higher lambda(23) and a lower FA, but there were no differences for D-av and lambda(1) when compared with the normal-appearing PYT. Moreover, the diffusion indices derived from the normal-appearing PYT were significantly correlated with PYT lesion volumes by using the Spearman correlation analysis.

376,375,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visualizing with MR imaging and obtaining quantitative indexes of degeneration of the substantia nigra in Parkinson disease have been long-sought goals. We investigated the potential role of area and T1 contrast measurements in differentiating patients from controls and their age-related changes. METHODS: Eight patients with Parkinson disease, 8 age-matched controls, and 8 young controls were imaged. We obtained the pixel-wise difference between 2 sets of inversion-recovery images, acquired parallel to the bicommissural plane, with different inversion times. Pixel-intensity ratios between lateral and medial nigral regions, and nigral area and substantia-nigra/midbrain area ratios were computed. RESULTS: Compared with that of controls, loss of substantia nigra was evident in patients, its borders taking a smoother and more irregular appearance. Patients were characterized by a lateral-to-medial gradient, due to reduced hypointensity of the lateral portion of the substantia nigra and relative sparing of its medial portion. The visible nigral area was significantly smaller in patients compared with matched controls (P = .04). The substantia nigra/midbrain area ratio enabled considerably better separation (P = .0001). The lateral/medial pixel-intensity ratio was significantly higher in patients compared with matched controls (P = .01) and in young controls compared with age-matched controls (P = .01). CONCLUSION: Inversion-recovery sequences may provide a convenient way to visualize nigral degeneration.

Coronary covered stent grafts have been sporadically used in the intracranial arteries and only 2 traumatic CCFs have been reported in the literature; moreover, there is poor information about the long-term follow-up. We present 8 cases of CCFs treated by the placement of a covered stent, 5 of which have a 1-year clinical and angiographic follow-up. METHODS: Eight patients with posttraumatic CCF were treated by positioning a covered stent in the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) to occlude the fistula. They received periodic clinical and angiographic follow-up to evaluate the patency and the stability of clinical results. RESULTS: In all cases, the symptoms related to the CCF regressed after treatment and did not recur in the follow-up. Two patients presented residual filling of the CCF at the end of the procedure. The angiographic follow-up revealed in 6 patients of 7 a good patency of the ICA; in 1 patient, there was an ICA asymptomatic occlusion.

We evaluate the preoperative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of benign and malignant salivary gland tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution MR imaging was performed on 31 patients with benign or malignant salivary gland tumors; ADC maps of the tumors were also obtained. Surface coils of 47 or 110 mm diameter were used to improve the image resolution. The ADCs were compared with histologic features of the excised tumors. RESULTS: The ADC maps effectively depicted the histologic features of the salivary gland tumors, such as presence of cancer cells, myxomatous tissues, fibrosis, necrosis, cyst formation, and lymphoid tissues. The ADC maps showed that more frequent areas with high ADCs (>= 1.8 X 10(-3) mm(2)/s) were significantly greater in benign tumors than in malignant tumors. The sensitivity and specificity for high ADC occupying fewer than 5% of the area of a tumor was 89% and 100%, respectively, resulting in 97% accuracy, 100% positive predictive value, and 96% negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: The ADC may provide preoperative tissue characterization of the salivary gland tumors",Apparent diffusion coefficient mapping of salivary gland tumors: Prediction of the benignancy and malignancy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17213436,['DTI'],1.967930029,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.967930029,"['mr', 'lesions', 'head', 'parotid-gland', 'diagnostic-value']",tumor
381,380,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The HydroCoil Embolic System (HES) was developed reduce recurrences of aneurysms relative to platinum coils. This study was conducted to evaluate the recurrence rate of cerebral aneurysms 3-6 months after treatment with HES. METHODS: We report the results in 135 cerebral aneurysms treated with HES in a prospective multicenter registry. Angiographic results 3-6 months after treatment were evaluated at a core laboratory. Wide variation in HES utilization within the HydroCoil for Endovascular Aneurysm Occlusion (HEAL) registry (HES representing 5% to 100% of the coil length used) allowed for subgroup analysis with regard to percentage length, last coil used, and packing attenuation in small (< 10 mm) aneurysms. RESULTS: The overall recurrence rate was 38 (28.1 %) of 135, which included a number of large, giant, and previously recurrent aneurysms. When HES represented 75% of coil length, the recurrence rate was 0 (0%) of 18, whereas with < 75% length of HES, the recurrence rate was 16 (23%) of 71 (P = .035). When the final coil deposited was a HES coil, the recurrence rate was 6 (11 %) of 53, whereas when the final coil was platinum, the recurrence rate was 10 (29%) of 34 (P = .047). When the packing attenuation was >= 50%, the recurrence rate was 11 (19%) of 59, whereas for packing attenuation < 50%, the recurrence rate was 5 (18%) of 28. The packing attenuation calculations were very error-prone. CONCLUSION: Although the overall recurrence rates for small and large aneurysms in HEAL were no lower than published rates for aneurysms treated with platinum coils, patients treated in HEAL had a reduced recurrence rate when greater than 75% of the coil length used to treat an aneurysm was HES and when the final coil was HES.",HydroCoil for endovascular aneurysm occlusion (HEAL) study: 3-6 month angiographic follow-up results,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17213446,['angiography'],1.822157434,angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.822157434,"['intracranial aneurysms', 'cerebral aneurysms', 'guglielmi detachable coils']",aneurysms
382,381,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy is a promising treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Few data are available on its use in elderly patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the baseline characteristics, complications, and outcomes between intra-arterially treated ischemic stroke patients aged >= 80 years and their younger counterparts. METHODS: Patients aged 80 years (n = 33) were compared retrospectively with contemporaneous patients aged < 80 years (n = 81) from a registry of consecutive patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis over a 9-year period. RESULTS: The very elderly and younger cohorts were very similar in baseline characteristics, including pretreatment stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] 17 versus 16), differing only in history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (42% versus 22%, P = .01) and weight (66.8 versus 75 8 kg; P = .02). Significant differences in recanalization (TIMI 2-3) rates could not be detected between the very elderly and younger patients (79% versus 68%, P = .10). Rates of major symptomatic hemorrhage (7% versus 8%) and any intracerebral hemorrhage (39% versus 37%) did not differ. Outcomes at 90 days showed lower rates of excellent functional outcome (mRS <= 1, 26% versus 40%, P = .02) and survival (57% versus 80%, P = .01) among the very elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial fibrinolysis in the elderly can be accomplished with recanalization rates and hemorrhage rates equal to that in younger patients. Although mortality rates are higher and good functional outcomes are lower than in younger persons, nondisabling outcomes may be achieved in a quarter of patients. These findings suggest that the investigation and use of intra-arterial thrombolytic treatment in very elderly patients should not be avoided but pursued judiciously.",Intra-arterial thrombolysis for acute stroke in patients 80 and older: A comparison of results in patients younger than 80 years,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2007,17213448,['Spectroscopy'],1.822157434,Spectroscopy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.822157434,"['hemorrhagic', 'tissue-plasminogen-activator', 'acute ischemic-stroke']",stroke
383,382,"Background and Purpose: We sought to determine whether mid-sagittal intracranial area (ICA) is a valid surrogate of intracranial volume (ICV) when using retrospective data with relatively thick (6-7 mm) sagittal slices. Methods: Data were retrospectively analyzed from 47 subjects who had two MRI scans taken at least nine months apart. Twenty-three subjects had manual segmentation of ICV on the T2-weighted sequence for comparison. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for intraobserver, interobserver, and intraobserver scan-rescan comparisons were 0.96, 0.97 and 0.95. Pearson correlation coefficients between ICV and ICA, averaging the cumulative 1, 2, 3, and 4 most midline slices, were 0.89, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.95. There was a significant marginal increase in explained variance of ICV by measuring two, rather than one, slices (P = 0.001).

384,383,"Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the risks of endovascular therapy, aneurysm regrowth, recanalization and the need for reembolization. Method A prospective analysis was performed on 211 aneurysms treated endovascularly from February 2000 to December 2003. Of these 211 aneurysms, 81 were asymptomatic and 130 were ruptured. The risks of endovascular therapy, aneurysm regrowth, recanalization and the need for reembolization were evaluated. Results The mean observation time was 10 months (ranging from 178 to 830 days). Complete occlusion (100%) in the initial intervention was achieved in 171 of 201 aneurysms (85%), 80-95% occlusion in 24 aneurysms (12%), and < 80% occlusion in 6 aneurysms (3%). Recanalization had occurred at the first follow-up in 34 of all 153 aneurysms reassessed (22.2%). Of 133 aneurysms with initial 100% occlusion, 107 (80.4%) remained completely occluded, 17 (12.7%) showed recanalization, and 9 (6.7%) showed neck regrowth. Among those with 80-95% occlusion, 20 were reassessed, and of these 2 showed spontaneous occlusion, 10 (50%) still showed the initial neck, and 8 (40%) showed increased recanalization. One aneurysm which initially showed < 80% occlusion remained unchanged, and another showed showed recanalization. Of the 153 aneurysms, 12 (7.8%) were recoiled, 2 initially < 80% occluded, 7 initially 80-95% occluded and 3 initially totally occluded. Conclusion In spite of low morbidity and mortality, one in four aneurysms will show recurrence.

385,384,"Introduction Until recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, was mainly used to study brain physiology. The activation signal measured with fMRI is based upon the changes in the concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin that arise from an increase in blood flow in the vicinity of neuronal firing. Technical limitations have impeded such research in the human cervical spinal cord. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether a reliable fMRI signal can be elicited from the cervical spinal cord during fingertapping, a complex motor activity. Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether the fMRI signal could be spatially localized to the particular neuroanatomical location specific for this task. Methods A group of 12 right-handed healthy volunteers performed the complex motor task of fingertapping with their right hand. T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging on a 1.5-T clinical unit was used to image the cervical spinal cord. Motion correction was applied. Cord activation was measured in the transverse imaging plane, between the spinal cord levels C5 and T1. Results In all subjects spinal cord responses were found, and in most of them on the left and the right side.

386,384,"Introduction Until recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, was mainly used to study brain physiology. The activation signal measured with fMRI is based upon the changes in the concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin that arise from an increase in blood flow in the vicinity of neuronal firing. Technical limitations have impeded such research in the human cervical spinal cord. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether a reliable fMRI signal can be elicited from the cervical spinal cord during fingertapping, a complex motor activity. Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether the fMRI signal could be spatially localized to the particular neuroanatomical location specific for this task.

387,385,"Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis of viral encephalitis and its relationship with the stage of the illness. Methods We performed conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) including T1-W, T2-W and fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR) sequences and DWI in 18 patients with viral encephalitis diagnosed on the basis of laboratory, clinical and radiologic findings. Based on the qualitative and quantitative comparison of the conventional MRI and DWI, the patients were divided into three groups. Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) values of the involved and contralateral normal brain tissues were computed and compared for each group. The degree of correlation between the time (TI) from the onset of neurologic symptoms to the MR examination and ADC values was determined. Results In group I (n=11) DWI was superior to conventional MRI in detecting the encephalitic involved sites and in depicting the borders of the encephalitic lesions. In group II (n=4) DWI was similar to conventional MRI. In group III (n=3) conventional MRI was superior to DWI.

389,387,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of unequal physiologic flow conditions in the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) on the hemodynamics of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models of 2 cerebral aneurysms were constructed from bilateral 3D rotational angiograms. The flow dynamics of the aneurysm sac were analyzed under the effect of unequal mean flows, phase shifts, and waveforms between the ICAs. A total of 9 simulations were performed for each patient; cine flow velocity simulations and unsteady wall shear stress (WSS) maps were created for each flow condition. Time-dependent curves of average WSS magnitude over selected regions on the aneurysms were constructed. RESULTS: Mean flow unbalances in the feeding vessels tended to shift the regions of elevated WSS towards the dominating inflow jet and to change the magnitude of the WSS peaks. The overall qualitative appearance of the WSS distribution and velocity simulations was not substantially affected. Phase and waveform asymmetry increased the temporal complexity of the hemodynamic patterns and tended to destabilize the flow pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the relative phase and waveform shape in ICAs can significantly affect the complexity and stability of the hemodynamic force distributions. The magnitude of these effects is related to the geometry of the aneurysm and the feeding vessels. Conditions affecting the flow characteristics in the parent arteries of cerebral aneurysms with more than 1 avenue of inflow should be incorporated into flow models.",Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics modeling of anterior communicating artery aneurysms: A study of the sensitivity of intra-aneurysmal flow patterns to flow conditions in the carotid arteries,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2006,17110667,['angiography'],1.825396825,angiography,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.825396825,"['hemodynamics', 'surgical-treatment', 'cerebral aneurysms', 'shear-stress']",aneurysms
390,388,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe the results of transvenous embolizations of cavernous dural arteriovenous fistua (cDAVF) with an emphasis on identifying the incidence, characteristics, and management strategies associated with the complications of transvenous embolization of cDAVFs. METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients who were treated by transvenous embolization for cDAVFs were reviewed. The approach routes, angiographic results, complications, and clinical outcome were assessed. RESULTS: Retrograde inferior petrosal sinus (n = 36), transfacial vein (n = 7), transcontralateral intercavernous sinus (n = 4), and direct superior ophthalmic vein (n = 3) approaches were used. Angiographic results showed complete occlusion (n = 29), nearly complete occlusion (n = 13), and incomplete occlusion (n = 14). Complications associated with the procedures were cranial nerve palsy (n = 6), venous perforation (n = 3), and brain stem congestion (n = 2). The cranial nerve signs resolved with conservative treatment. Venous perforations were managed by coil embolizations at the site of the tear with no significant neurologic sequelae. One case of brain stem congestion resulted in henniplegia after conservative treatment. The other case showed venous congestion as a result of rerouting of the shunted flow after venous embolization that was successfully managed by covered stent deployment for occlusion of the residual feeders. Clinical follow-up data were available in 46 patients. Complete resolution or improvement of symptoms was seen in 42 patients (91%). CONCLUSIONS: Cavernous DAVFs may be effectively treated by transvenous embolization. However, the procedure can be associated with various complications, some of which can potentially result in significant morbidity.

We used digital lateral radiography to perform the classical two-dimensional cephalometry, and a three-dimensional CT surface model for the three-dimensional cephalometry. Results Diagnoses based on both two-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses were adequate, but the three-dimensional analysis gave more information such as the possibility of comparing the right and left side of the skull. Also the anatomic structures were not superimposed which improved the visibility of the reference landmarks.

393,391,"PURPOSE: Protected carotid artery stent placement is currently under clinical evaluation as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy. The current study was undertaken to determine the incidence of new ischemic lesions found on diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in nonselected patients after protected carotid artery stent placement using a filter device and to determine the potential relationship between these new ischernic lesions and the presence or absence of a clear amount of debris captured by the neuroprotection filter device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nonrandomized cohort of 52 patients (40 men, 12 women) presenting with carotid occlusive disease underwent protected carotid artery stent placement using a filter device. DWI obtained 1 day before stent placement was compared with that obtained 1 day after stent placement. In addition, the macroscopic and microscopic analysis of debris captured by the filter device during the carotid stent placement procedure was assessed. RESULTS: Neuroprotected carotid stent placement was technically successful in all 53 procedures but was complicated by a transient ischemic attack in 3 patients (5.6%). In 22 patients (41.5%), new ischemic lesions were found on DWI, and in 21 filter devices (39.6%), a substantial amount of atheromatous plaque and/or fibrin was found. No clear relationship between the presence of debris captured by the filter device and new lesions detected by DWI was found (P = .087; odds ratio 3.067). CONCLUSION: Neuroprotected carotid artery stent placement will not avoid silent cerebral ischemia.

Larger cement volumes injected may be associated with better clinical outcomes, but larger volumes may also be associated with greater risk of complications related to cement leakage. We describe an analysis of the association between clinical and procedural variables, including cement volume injected, and the clinical outcomes of patients treated with single-level vertebroplasty. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 158 patients treated with single-level vertebroplasty was performed. Relationships among patient and procedural variables and relationships between these variables and ordinal clinical outcome scores of pain and medication use at postprocedure time points from 1 week to 2 years were evaluated with bivariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: There was no significant association between the volume of cement injected and the clinical outcomes of postprocedure pain (P = .159-871) and medication use (P = .223-.875).

In this study, results of histologic examination from samples obtained from image-guided brain biopsies were correlated with diffusion tensor images.

Patients underwent image-guided biopsies with multiple biopsies taken along a single track that went into normal-appearing brain. Regions of interest were determined from the sites of the biopsies, and diffusion tensor imaging findings were compared with glioma histology.

RESULTS: Three patients, who had drowsiness and new-onset convulsions, recovered spontaneously without any medication. In the other 2 seizure-free patients, 1 had trigeminal neuralgia and headache and the other had facial numbness and left upper monoparesis. All patients had round well-defined ovoid hyperintense splenial lesions (14.94 +/- 1.87 mm) on DWI with a significantly low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of 0.41 +/- 0.05 X 10(-3) mm(2)/s compared with 0.84 +/- 0.01 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s of normal-appea ring white matter. In the patient with a motor deficit, additional lesions were found in the cerebral deep white matter. The high signal intensity of the splenial and deep white matter lesions on DWI completely disappeared on follow-up studies, and ADC values also improved, returning to those of normal-appearing white matter on days 8-11.

398,396,"Background/Purpose: Gray matter involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) is of growing interest with respect to disease pathogenesis. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), an advanced MRI technique, is sensitive to disease in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with MS. Design/Methods: We tested if MTI detected subcortical (deep) gray matter abnormalities in patients with MS (n = 60) vs. age-matched normal controls (NL, n = 20). Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) maps were produced from axial proton density, conventional spin-echo, 5 mm gapless slices covering the whole brain. Region-of-interest-derived MTR histograms for the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and NAWM were obtained. Whole brain MTR was also measured. Results: Mean whole brain MTR and the peak position of the NAWM MTR histogram were lower in patients with MS than NL (P < .001) and mean whole brain MTR was lower in secondary progressive (SP, n = 10) than relapsing-remitting (RR, n = 50, P < .001) patients. However, none of the subcortical gray matter nuclei showed MTR differences in MS vs. NL, RR vs. SP, or SP vs. NL. Conclusions: The MTI technique used in this cohort was relatively insensitive to disease in the deep gray matter nuclei despite showing sensitivity for whole brain disease in MS.

We aimed to study the stroke pattern on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), in cryptogenetic stroke according to septal abnormalities. Methods. We prospectively evaluated 314 cryptogenetic strokes. Patients were categorized according to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) findings: PFO with ASA, PFO alone, and no abnormalities. The study group consisted of 126 patients with acute DWI lesions within the first 7 days after the stroke onset. We considered the presence of scattered lesions or a cortico-subcortical territorial lesion as highly suggestive of an embolic pattern. Results. PFO was identified in 77 patients (61%) and no alterations in 49 patients (39%). TEE revealed ASA in 42 patients (54.5% of PFO patients). An ""embolic"" pattern was depicted in 84 (66.7%) and subcortical in 42 (33.3%). An ""embolic"" pattern was significantly (P = .01) more frequently seen in PFO with ASA patients (n = 37;44%) as compared to PFO without ASA (n = 22; 26.2%) or no abnormalities (n = 25; 29.8%) on TEE. Univariate analysis revealed that age (P = .06), hyperlipidemia (P = .04), degree of shunt on TEE (P = .002), and the presence of an ASA (P = .008) were associated with an embolic pattern. After adjusting for sex, age, and vascular risk factors, only the presence of PFO, with ASA (OR 7.27; 95% CI 1.5-35.22 P = .014) was independently associated with an embolic pattern. Conclusion. In patients with cryptogenetic stroke, the presence of PFO with ASA, but not isolated PFO, is associated with an embolic pattern on DWI.

403,401,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To report morbidity, mortality, and angiographic results of elective coiling of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: In a 10-year period, 176 unruptured aneurysms in 149 patients were electively treated with detachable coils. Seventy-nine aneurysms were additional to another ruptured aneurysm but were coiled more than 3 months after subarachnoid hemorrhage, 59 aneurysms were incidentally discovered, and 38 aneurysms presented with symptoms of mass effect. Mean size of the 176 unruptured aneurysms was 10.6 mm (median, 8 mm; range, 2-55 mm). One hundred thirteen aneurysms (64%) were small (< 10 mm), 44 aneurysms (25%) were large (10-25 mm), and 19 aneurysms (11%) were giant (25-55 mm). Thirty wide-necked aneurysms (17%) were coiled with the aid of a supporting device. RESULTS: Procedural mortality of coiling was 1.3% (2 of 149; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.7-5.1%), and morbidity was 2.6% (4 of 149, 95% Cl, 0.8-7.0%). The 4 patients with permanent morbidity were independent (GOS 4). Initial aneurysm occlusion was complete (100%) in 132 aneurysms, nearly complete (90%-98%) in 36 aneurysms, and incomplete (60%-85%) in 8 aneurysms. Six-month follow-up angiography was available in 132 patients with 154 coiled aneurysms (87.5%); partial reopening occurred in 25, mainly large and giant aneurysms (16.2%). Additional coiling was performed in 22 aneurysms and additional parent vessel occlusion in 1 aneurysm. There were no complications of additional treatments.

405,403,"Introduction: Differential radiologic diagnosis of cystic malformations of the posterior fossa is often difficult with conventional imaging techniques because of overlapping features of these entities. Posterior fossa cystic malformations occupy the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces. They may create secondary dynamic effects on the movements of CSF. The aim of this study was to investigate CSF flow alterations in posterior fossa cystic malformations with CSF flow MR imaging. Methods: The study included 40 patients with cystic malformations of the posterior fossa. The patients underwent cardiac-gated phase-contrast cine MR imaging. CSF flow was qualitatively evaluated using an in-plane phase-contrast sequence in the midsagittal plane. The MR images were displayed in a closed-loop cine format. Results: Twelve of the patients had communicating arachnoid cyst, seven had non-communicating arachnoid cyst, ten had mega cisterna magna, six had Dandy-Walker malformation, two had Dandy-Walker variant, and three had Blake's pouch cyst. CSF flow MR imaging indicated the regions of no, slow or higher flow, direction of flow, and abnormal cystic fluid motion. Each malformation displayed a distinct CSF flow pattern. Conclusion: Phase-contrast cine MR imaging for CSF flow evaluation may be a useful adjunct to routine MR imaging in the evaluation of the cystic malformations of the posterior fossa because it can improve the specificity in differentiating such malformations.",Evaluation of CSF flow patterns of posterior fossa cystic malformations using CSF flow MR imaging,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article; Proceedings Paper,2006,16752134,['MRI'],1.931330472,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,1.931330472,"['dandy walker malformation', 'cerebrospinal-fluid flow', 'arachnoid cyst', 'ct cisternography', 'contrast cine mr', 'cine mri', 'intracranial arachnoid']",malformation
406,404,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: [C-11]Methionine (MET) PET imaging is a sensitive technique for visualizing primary brain tumors and recurrence/progression after therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the uptake of MET and histopathologic grading and to investigate the prognostic value of the tracer, in both settings. METHODS: Cerebral uptake of MET was determined in 52 patients: in 26 patients for primary staging (group A) and 26 patients with suspected brain tumor recurrence/progression after therapy (group B). Senniquantitative methionine uptake indices (UI) defined by the tumor (maximum)-to-background ratio was correlated with tumor grade and final outcome. RESULTS: Overall median survival was 34.9 months. MET showed pathologically increased uptake in 41 of 52 scans. Although a weak linear correlation between MET uptake and grading was observed (R = 0.38, P =.028), analysis of variance showed no significant differences in MET UI between tumor grades for either group A or B. Benign and grade I lesions showed significant difference in MET uptake in comparison with higher grade lesions (P=.006). Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, no thresholds could be found at which MET was predictive for survival. Proportional hazard regression showed that only WHO grading class (low versus high) was predictive of survival (P=.015). CONCLUSION: Interindividual MET uptake variability does not allow noninvasive grading on an individual patient basis. Moreover, there is no significant prognostic value in studying maximal methionine U I in brain tumors. The clinical use of MET should therefore be primarily focused on questions such as detection of recurrence, biopsy guidance, and radiation therapy target volume delineation.","[C-11]Methionine PET, histopathology, and survival in primary brain tumors and recurrence",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2006,16908552,['PET'],2.301587302,PET,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.301587302,"['positron-emission-tomography', 'amino-acid-transport', 'guided stereotaxic']",tumor
407,405,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging has played an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) since basal ganglia abnormalities on T2-weighted images have been described; thus, the aim of our study was to compare the value of different MR images in the diagnosis of CJD. METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with CJD underwent MR imaging examinations. Ninety-two patients were neuropathologically confirmed, and 65 were clinically classified as having CJD through the CJD Surveillance Unit (probability of 95%). There was no standardized MR imaging protocol; thus, the examinations included 143 T2-weighted, 43 proton attenuation (PD)-weighted, 84 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and 44 diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The MR images were reviewed for pathologic changes of the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. RESULTS: Cortical abnormalities were present in 70 patients (45%) and were visible in 80% (35/44) of all available DWI examinations. The basal ganglia were affected in 94 patients (60%), in particular in the caudate nucleus; the most sensitive sequences were DWI (64%) and PD-weighted (63%). A thalamic involvement was more frequently diagnosed on PD-weighted images (19%) and DWI (14%) than on FLAIR or T2-weighted images. CONCLUSION: PD-weighted images and DWI showed better results in the diagnosis of signal intensity changes in the basal ganglia compared with T2-weighted or FLAIR images; however, in the diagnosis of cortical changes, DWI was clearly superior, Our data suggest that DWI is the most sensitive MR imaging technique in the diagnosis of CJD.",Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Comparative analysis of MR imaging sequences,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2006,16908558,['DTI'],2.46031746,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.46031746,"['diagnosis', 'accuracy', 'abnormalities', '14-3-3 protein']",CJD

409,407,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment with stent placement or stent-assisted coiling was recently introduced as an alternative to parent artery occlusion in intracranial vertebral artery dissections. We describe the efficacy and limitations of this method. METHODS: Fourteen patients with intracranial vertebral artery dissection were treated with stent placement (10 patients) or stent-assisted coiling (4 patients). Double overlapping stents were deployed in 4 of 10 patients with stent placement alone. Angiographic follow-up at 6 to 12 months was available in 13 patients. RESULTS: In 13 patients with dissecting aneurysm, immediate angiographic outcomes were complete occlusion (1 patient), nearly complete (2 patients), and incomplete (110 patients). Follow-up angiograms of 12 of these patients showed complete occlusion (6 patients) and incomplete (6 patients; 1 unstable and 5 stable). Complete occlusion rates in follow-up angiograms were superior in double stent placement (75%) or stent-assisted Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization to stent placement alone (0%). There were no instances of postprocedural ischemic attacks, new neurologic deficits, and no new minor or major strokes before patient discharge. On the modified Rankin scale applied in follow-up, all patients were assessed as functionally improved or of stable clinical status. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial vertebral artery dissections were acceptably treated with stent placement or stent-assisted coiling, and the patency could be preserved at follow-up.

411,409,"BACKGROUND: Results from cerebral proton H-1-MR spectroscopy studies of neonates with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury have generally been presented as metabolite peak-area ratios, which are T1 and T2-weighted, rather than absolute metabolite concentrations. We hypothesized that compared with 1H-MR spectroscopy peak-area ratios, calculation of absolute metabolite concentrations and relaxation times measured within the first 4 days after birth (1) would improve prognostic accuracy and (2) enhance the understanding of underlying neurochemical changes in neonates with neonatal encephalopathy. METHODS: Seventeen term infants with neonatal encephalopathy and 10 healthy controls were studied at 2.4T at 1 (1-3) and 2 (2-4) (median [interquartile range]) days afterbirth, respectively. Infants with neonatal encephalopathy were classified into 2 outcome groups (normal/mild and severe/fatal), according to neurodevelopmental assessments at 1 year. The MR spectroscopy peak-area ratios, relaxation times, absolute concentrations, and concentration ratios of lactate (Lac), creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and choline-containing compounds (Cho) from a voxel centered on the thalami were analyzed according to outcome group. RESULTS: Comparing the severe/fatal group with the controls (significance assumed with P < 0.05), we found that Lac/NAA, Lac/Cho, and Lac/Cr peak-area ratios increased and NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho decreased; Lac, NAA, and Cr T2s were increased; [Lac] was increased and [Cho], [Cr], and [NAA] decreased; and among the concentration ratios, only [Lac]/[NAA] was increased. Comparison of the normal/mild group with controls revealed no differences in peak-area ratios, relaxation times, or concentration ratios but decreased [NAA], [Cho], and [Cr] were observed in the infants with normal/mild outcome. Comparison of the normal/mild and severe/fatal groups showed increased Lac/NAA and Lac/Cho and decreased NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho peak-area ratios, reduced [NAA], and increased Lac T2 in the infants with the worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolite concentrations, in particular [NAA], enhance the prognostic accuracy of cerebral H-1-MR spectroscopy-[NAA] was the only measurable to discriminate among all (control, normal/mild, and severe/fatal outcome) groups. However, peak-area ratios are more useful prognostic indicators than concentration ratios because they depend on metabolite concentrations and T2s, both of which are pathologically modulated. Concentration ratios depend only on the concentrations of the constituent metabolites. Increased Cr T2 may provide an indirect marker of impaired cellular energetics, and similarly, NAA T2 may constitute an index of exclusively neuronal energy status. Our recommendation is to collect data that enable calculation of brain metabolite concentrations. However, if time constraints make this impossible, metabolite peak-area ratios provide the next best method of assigning early prognosis in neonatal encephalopathy.","Proton MR spectroscopy in neonates with perinatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury: Metabolite peak-area ratios, relaxation times, and absolute concentrations",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2006,16908578,['Spectroscopy'],1.984126984,Spectroscopy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.984126984,"['magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy', 'developing human brain', 'birth asphyxia']",asphyxia
412,410,"Background and Purpose. Endovascular treatment for intracranial atherosclerosis is evolving, but complications remain an issue. Most interventions are performed under general anesthesia, preventing intraprocedural clinical evaluations. We describe our approach to intracranial angioplasty and stenting, using local rather than general anesthesia, and intraprocedural neurological assessment. Methods. We prospectively collected procedural and outcome information on all patients undergoing intracranial angioplasty and stenting. Patients underwent interventions under local anesthesia with mild intravenous sedation or analgesia only if needed. Intraoperative neurological evaluations were performed, and symptomatology was used to guide the interventional technique. Results. Forty-eight arteries in 40 patients with a mean age of 65.2 years were treated. Thirty-two anterior and 16 posterior circulation segments were treated. Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients with reduction of the mean pretreatment stenosis from 85 +/- 8.6% to 7 +/- 10.1%. Stents were deployed in 40 segments; five patients were treated with drug-eluting stents. The cobalt-chromium coronary stents were the easiest to deliver. Thirty-seven patients were treated under local anesthesia and, of those, 61.4% experienced intraprocedural symptoms that led to some alteration of the interventional technique. Headache was the most common symptom, and, when persistent, it heralded the occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were seven total neurological complications, but only five (10.5%) led to permanent morbidity (4 strokes) or mortality (1 death). Conclusions. Intracranial angioplasty and stenting can be successfully performed using coronary techniques and equipment including drug-eluting stents. Local anesthesia permits neurological evaluations and often leads to the adjustment of the interventional technique, potentially making the procedure safer.",Intracranial angioplasty and stenting in the awake patient,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,Article,2006,16808823,['angiography'],2.581755594,angiography,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING,2.581755594,"['stroke prevention', 'percutaneous transluminal angioplasty', 'stenosis', 'stents', 'anesthesia', 'atherosclerotic stenosis', 'complications']",stenosis
413,411,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA, formerly called Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome) often have mutations in PANK2, the gene encoding pantothenate kinase 2. We investigated correlations between brain MR imaging changes, mutation status, and clinical disease features. METHODS: Brain MRIs from patients with NBIA were reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists for technical factors, including signal intensity abnormalities in specific brain regions, presence and location of atrophy, presence of white matter abnormality, contrast enhancement, and other comments. PANK2 genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of patient genomic DNA followed by automated nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: Sixty-six MR imaging examinations from 49 NBIA patients were analyzed, including those from 29 patients with mutations in PANK2. All patients with mutations had the specific pattern of globus pallidus central hyperintensity with surrounding hypointensity on T2-weighted images, known as the eye-of-the-tiger sign. This sign was not seen in any studies from patients without mutations. Even before the globus pallidus hypointensity developed, patients with mutations could be distinguished by the presence of isolated globus pallidus hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. Radiographic evidence for iron deposition in the substantia nigra was absent early in disease associated with,PANK2 mutations. MR imaging abnormalities outside the globus pallidus, including cerebral or cerebellar atrophy, were more common and more severe in mutation-negative patients. No specific MR imaging changes could be distinguished among the mutation-negative patients. CONCLUSION: MR imaging signal intensity abnormalities in the globus pallidus can distinguish patients with mutations in PANK2 from those lacking a mutation, even in the early stages of disease.",Brain MRI in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation with and without PANK2 mutations,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2006,16775270,['MRI'],2.063492063,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.063492063,"['hallervorden-spatz-syndrome', 'disease']",neurodegeneration
414,412,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical efficacy of filter devices in internal carotid artery (ICA) stent placement has been a matter of controversy. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the number and extent of cerebral emboli, as represented by new lesions on diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI), in patients treated with filter-protected carotid stent placement. METHODS: Standard DWI (B0 = 1000) was performed within 48 hours before and 48 hours after filter-protected carotid stent placement in 50 patients with symptomatic, high grade > 70%), atherosclerotic ICA stenosis. Number, extent, and vascular territory of new DWI lesions after stent placement were assessed by consensus of 2 experienced neuroradiologists. Multifactorial statistical analysis was performed to determine risk factors associated with DWI lesions. RESULTS: New punctate DWI lesions with a median diameter of 2 mm were detected in 14 of 50 cases in the territory of the stented ICA and in 7 of 50 cases in other vascular territories. Median lesion load was I lesion (range, 1-15) per positive case in the stented ICA and I lesion (range, 1-7) in other vascular territories. All DWI lesions were clinically asymptomatic. Because of I hyperperfusion syndrome with temporary brain swelling, the 30-day stroke and death rate was 2%. Age >= 70 years was the only significant predictor for new DWI lesions, whereas sex, degree and site of stenosis, vascular risk factors, and stent and filter type showed no significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: New DWI lesions after filter-protected carotid stent placement are substantially more frequent in the ipsilateral ICA territory compared with other vascular territories. Therefore, intraluminal filters cannot completely protect the brain from procedure-related embolization. However, individual lesion load and the risk of clinically relevant ischemia is low.",Diffusion-weighted MR imaging lesions after filter-protected stenting of high-grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2006,16775290,['DTI'],1.904761905,DTI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.904761905,"['embolic events', 'placement', 'cerebral protection', 'devices', 'angiography']",stenosis

417,415,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps provide information at MR imaging that may reflect cell attenuation and integrity. We hypothesized that cerebellar tumors in children can be differentiated by their ADC values. METHODS: Brain MR imaging studies that included ADC maps were retrospectively reviewed in 32 patients with histologically proved cerebellar neoplasm. There were 17 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (JPA), 8 medulloblastomas, 5 ependymomas, and 2 rhabdoid (atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor [AT/RT]) tumors. Absolute ADC values of contrast-enhancing solid tumor regions and ADC ratios (ADC of solid tumor to ADC of normal-appearing white matter) were compared with the histologic diagnosis. ADC values and ratios of JPAs, medulloblastomas, and ependymomas were compared by using a 2-tailed t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: ADC values were significantly higher in pilocytic astrocytomas (1.65 +/- 0.27) (mean +/- SD) than in ependymomas (1.10 +/- 0.11) (P = .0003) and medulloblastomas (0.66 +/- 0.15) (P <.0001). Ependymomas demonstrated significantly higher ADC values than medulloblastomas (P =.0005). The observed differences were statistically significant on ANOVA (P <.001). ADC ratios were also significantly different among these 3 tumor types. AT/RT ADC values were similar to medulloblastoma. The range of ADC values and ratios within JPAs and ependymomas did not overlap with that of medulloblastomas.

419,417,"Introduction: Inherited prion diseases are caused by mutations in the gene which codes for prion protein (PrP), leading to proliferation of abnormal PrP isomers in the brain and neurodegeneration; they include Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD). Methods: We studied two patients with symptomatic inherited prion disease (P102L) and two pre-symptomatic P102L gene carriers using quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Short echo time spectra were acquired from the thalamus, caudate region and frontal white matter, metabolite levels and ratios were measured and z-scores calculated for individual patients relative to age-matched normal controls. MRS data were compared with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Results: One fCJD case had generalised atrophy and showed increased levels of myo-inositol (MI) in the thalamus (z=3.7). The other had decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (z=4) and diffuse signal abnormality in the frontal white matter. Both asymptomatic gene carriers had normal imaging, but increased frontal white matter MI (z=4.3, 4.1), and one also had increased MI in the caudate (z=5.3). Conclusion: Isolated MI abnormalities in asymptomatic gene carriers are a novel finding and may reflect early glial proliferation, prior to significant neuronal damage.

421,419,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite its potential for visualizing white matter fiber tracts in vivo, diffusion tensor tractography has found only limited applications in clinical research in which specific anatomic connections between distant regions need to be evaluated. We introduce a robust method for fiber clustering that guides the separation of anatomically distinct fiber tracts and enables further estimation of anatomic connectivity between distant brain regions. METHODS: Line scanning diffusion tenser images (LSDTI) were acquired on a 1.5T magnet. Regions of interest for several anatomically distinct fiber tracts were manually drawn; then, white matter tractography was performed by using the Runge-Kutta method to interpolate paths (fiber traces) following the major directions of diffusion, in which traces were seeded only within the defined regions of interest. Next, a fully automatic procedure was applied to fiber traces, grouping them according to a pairwise similarity function that takes into account the shapes of the fibers and their spatial locations. RESULTS: We demonstrated the ability of the clustering algorithm to separate several fiber tracts which are otherwise difficult to define (left and right fornix, uncinate fasciculus and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and corpus callosum fibers).

422,420,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown microbleeds to be a risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke. This study was performed to determine whether combinations of the presence or absence of microbleeds and advanced WMH are risk factors for subsequent recurrent stroke types. METHODS: In 266 patients with stroke, microbleeds on T2*-weighted MR images were counted, and WMH on T2-weighted images was graded. Patients were divided into 4 groups by the combinations of the presence or absence of microbleeds and advanced WMH and were followed up for stroke recurrence. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 564.8 +/- 220.5 days, 26 patients developed recurrent strokes, including 10 intracerebral hemorrhages and 16 ischemic strokes. Patients with microbleeds without advanced WMH (n = 42) developed only intracerebral hemorrhages (n = 8), and the recurrence rate of intracerebral hemorrhage in those patients estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was the highest in the 4 groups (14.3% in 1 year and 21.2% in 2 years). In contrast, patients with advanced WMH without microbleeds (n = 39) developed only ischemic strokes (n = 6), and the estimated recurrent rate of ischemic stroke in those patients was the highest in the 4 groups (10.5% in 1 year and 17.4% in 2 years). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that microbleeds were associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio [HR], 85.626; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.344-1155.649) and that advanced WMH was negatively associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 0.016; 95% CI, 0.001-0.258). Advanced WMH was associated with ischemic stroke (HR, 10.659; 95% CI, 2.601-43.678). CONCLUSION: It appears that patients at high risk of subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage or ischemic stroke can be identified by combinations of the presence or absence of microbleeds and advanced WMH.",Combinations of the presence or absence of cerebral microbleeds and advanced white matter hyperintensity as predictors of subsequent stroke types,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2006,16611773,['MRI'],1.825396825,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.825396825,"['risk-factor', 'asymptomatic microbleeds', 't2-asterisk-weighted mr-images']",stroke
423,421,"INTRODUCTION: Noninvasive measurements of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and contrast transfer coefficient (K-trans) have potential benefits in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of adult glioma. This study examines the relationship between CBV, K-trans, and overall survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-seven adult patients with glioma underwent T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, and parametric maps of CBV and K-trans were calculated. The relationship of histologic grade, CBV, K-trans, age, sex, surgical resection, and use of adjuvant therapy to survival were analyzed by using the logrank method and Cox regression analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method for displaying survival curves was used. The relationship of factors such as comorbidity, elevated intracranial pressure, size of nonenhancing tumor, and peritumoral edema were not considered. RESULTS: Both CBV (P < .01) and K-trans (P < .01) show a significant relationship to histologic grade. CBV (P = .004), K-trans (p = .008), and histologic grade (P < .001) all demonstrate a significant association with patient survival when analyzed individually. Cox regression analysis identified only histologic grade (P < .01) and K-trans (p < .05) as independent significant prognostic indicators. Examination of survival data from high-grade (III and IV) tumors demonstrated a linear relationship between K-trans and patient survival (P < .01). CONCLUSION: This study suggests a direct relationship between K-trans and length of survival in high-grade gliomas, which could be of clinical importance. CBV relates directly to histologic grade but provides no independent prognostic information over and above that provided by grade. Further large prospective studies should be planned to test whether this observation holds true.",Do cerebral blood volume and contrast transfer coefficient predict prognosis in human glioma?,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2006,16611778,['MRI'],1.984126984,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.984126984,"['endothelial growth-factor', 'enhanced mri', 'brain-tumors']",stroke

Calculations with reduced distal diameters are fallacious. CT angiography (CTA) is convenient and accurately quantifies internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. METHODS: In a blinded protocol, 268 carotid artery CTAs for known or suspected carotid disease were independently evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists. All carotid arteries were measured in millimeters at the narrowest diameter of the stenotic bulb, distal ICA well beyond the tapering bulb, and distal external carotid artery (ECA). Near-occlusions were independently identified, with disagreements settled by consensus meeting. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis defined the threshold values that best predicted near-occlusion according to (1) ICA stenosis, (2) distal ICA, (3) distal ICA: contralateral distal ICA, and (4) distal ICA: ECA.

427,425,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In Alzheimer disease (AD), elevated brain iron concentrations in gray matter suggest a disruption in iron homeostasis, while demyelination processes in white matter increase the water content. Our aim was to assess whether the transverse proton relaxation rate, or R-2, an MR imaging parameter affected by changes in brain iron concentration and water content, was different in elderly participants with mild to severe levels of cognitive impairment compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Twelve elderly participants reporting memory problems and 11 healthy volunteers underwent single-spin-echo MR imaging in a 1.5T scanner, with subsequent neuropsychological testing. R-2 data were collected from 14 brain regions in cortical and subcortical gray and white matter. Those with memory complaints were separated into 2 further subgroups: MC1 (no objective cognitive impairment) and MC2 (mild to severe objective cognitive impairment). RESULTS: Mean brain R-2 values from the 11 controls correlated strongly (r = 0.94, P < .0001) with reference brain iron concentrations for healthy adults. R-2 values in the MC1 and MC2 subgroups were significantly higher in the right temporal cortex and significantly lower in the left internal capsule, compared with healthy controls. R-2 values in the MC2 subgroup were significantly lower in the left temporal and frontal white matter, compared with healthy controls.

429,427,"Background and Purpose: Primary angiitis of the central nervous system of childhood (cPACNS) is a rare and ill-defined disease. In the absence of a brain biopsy, the diagnosis is based on typical clinical and imaging abnormalities. The aim of this study was to analyze systematically the MR imaging and MR angiographic (MRA) abnormalities in a large cohort of children with cPACNS. Methods: We analyzed the MR imaging features of a single pediatric center cohort of 45 cPACNS patients. MR imaging studies were performed for all patients, and both MR imaging and MRA were performed for 42 patients, who formed the cohort for review of the presence and correlation of lesions. Proportions were calculated by using the Fisher exact test, and agreement between MR imaging and MRA was calculated by using the McNemar test. The sensitivity of each diagnostic technique was established. Results: The most-common pattern of parenchymal abnormality was multifocal, unilateral involvement, each in 42/45 patients (93%). The lateral lenticulostriate artery terrritory was affected in 56% of cases, with involvement of a supratentorial deep gray matter structure in 91%. No infratentorial lesion occurred in the absence of supratentorial abnormality. MRA was normal in 12/42 patients (28.6%). Among the abnormal studies, stenosis was detected on MRA in 83% and was ""benign"" in appearance in 73% of patients and ""aggressive"" in 16.7%. Involvement was proximal in 83% and distal in 27% of patients. Multiple ipsilateral lesions were seen in 63%. MR imaging was abnormal in every patient where MRA was abnormal. With the assumption of MR imaging as the gold standard, the sensitivity of MRA was 72%. The agreement between MR imaging and MRA for abnormality was significant (P=.04). Conclusion: We have illustrated the MR imaging and MRA appearances of cPACNS in the largest cohort to date. Both parenchymal and vascular lesions were predominantly proximal, unilateral, and multifocal within the anterior circulation. There was good agreement between MR imaging and MRA for lesion location.

This reports the clinical, ultrasonographic, and neuroradiological findings in 24 patients with 28 vertebral artery dissections in the neck (4 occurring bilaterally). In 20 patients (83%), the dissection was temporally related to trauma. No patients had an underlying vascular disease, for example, atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. In all, the major initial manifestation was pain in the occipital or neck region. The next most common symptoms were vertigo and nausea (in 17 patients). Clinical manifestations were vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack (TIA) (5 patients: in 2 patients vestibulocerebellar TIA, in 1 patient visual TIA, in 1 patient motor TIA, and in 1 patient brain stem TIA with perioral paresthesia), cerebellar infarction (10 patients, in 4 patients bilateral), brainstem infarction (5 patients), posterior cerebral artery territory infarction (1 patient), and multiple vertebrobasilar ischemic lesions Q patients). Typical angiographic findings were irregular narrowing of the vessel lumen or a tapering stenosis with distal occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a thickened vessel wall with hematoma signal at the site of the dissection. Duplex color-flow imaging was valuable for the early diagnosis of extracranial vertebral artery dissection and for follow-up examinations.

Of the 17 patients, 14 (82%) had abnormal HPS imaging, and 12 (70%) had more than one area involved. Lack of the bright spot of the posterior pituitary lobe was typically found in all patients with the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI). Eight patients (47%) had infundibular enlargement, six (35%) pituitary infiltration, four (24%) partially or completely empty sella, three (18%) hypothalamic involvement, and two (12%) infundibular atrophy. DI was found in 16 patients (94%) and anterior pituitary hormonal deficiency (APHD) in 10 patients (59%); two patients had single (12%) and 8 (47%) multiple APHD. During the follow-up period there was improvement of the initially demonstrated HPS pathology in seven (47%) patients, and five (33%) of them had received at least one form of treatment. APHD and DI persisted in all patients except in one in whom established gonadotrophin deficiency recovered.

434,432,"The pathogenesis of intracranial arterial aneurysms (AA) remains unclear, despite their clinical importance. An improved understanding of this disease is important in choosing therapeutic options. In addition to the ""classical"" berry-type aneurysm, there are various other types of intracranial AA such as infectious, dissecting or giant, partially-thrombosed aneurysms. From the clinician's perspective, the hypothesis that some of these intracranial AA might be due to abluminal factors has been proposed for several years. Indeed, this hypothesis and the empirical use of anti-inflammatory drugs in giant intracranial aneurysms have been confirmed by recent studies reporting that an enzyme involved in the inflammatory cascade (5-lipoxygenase or 5-LO) promotes the pathogenesis of specific aneurysms in humans. 5-LO generates different forms of leukotrienes which are potent mediators of inflammation. Adventitial inflammation leads to a weakening of the media from the abluminal part of the vessel wall due to the release of proinflammatory factors that invade the media, thereby degrading the extracellular matrix, the elastic lamina of the vascular wall, and, finally, the integrity of the vessel lumen. This in turn results in a dilation of the vessel and aneurysm formation. Moreover, neoangiogenesis of vasa vasorum is found in close proximity to 5-LO activated macrophages. In addition to this biological cascade, we argue that repeated subadventitial haemorrhages from the new vasa vasorum play an important role in aneurysm pathogenesis, due to a progressive increase in size mediated by the apposition of new layers of intramural haematoma within the vessel wall. Intracranial giant AA can therefore be regarded as a proliferative disease of the vessel wall induced by extravascular activity. Considering certain aneurysmal vasculopathies as an abluminal disease might alter current therapeutic strategies. Therapy should not only be aimed at the intraluminal repair of the artery, but also cross the vessel wall to reach the vasa vasorum. Drug-eluting stents placed proximal to the lesion and targeted to the origin of the vasa vasorum could be considered as a potential future option. ""Intelligent"" MRI contrast agents (i.e., macrophage marking) could be used to detect vasa vasorum proliferation and weakening of the vessel wall in vivo.",Intracranial arterial aneurysm vasculopathies: targeting the outer vessel wall,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2005,16136262,['MRI'],2.054794521,MRI,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.054794521,"['arterial aneurysm', 'inflammation', 'vasa vasorum', '5-lipoxygenase pathway', '5-lipoxygenase', 'giant aneurysm', 'vasa', 'superparamagnetic iron-oxide']",aneurysms
435,433,"We evaluated prospectively the relation between packing and reopening in coiled intracranial aneurysms. Packing, defined as the ratio between the volume of inserted coils and volume of the aneurysm expressed as percentage, was calculated for 82 intracranial aneurysms treated with detachable coils. Aneurysm volume was assessed from 3D angiography. Reopening of the aneurysmal lumen at the 6-monthfollow-up angiography was dichotomized into present or absent. We assessed whether packing above 24% protected against reopening. Twenty-three of 82 aneurysms (28%) showed reopening. Reopening was caused by compaction in 20 aneurysms and by partial thrombosis, undetected at the time of initial treatment in three aneurysms. Three of 29 aneurysms (10%) with a packing of more than 24% showed reopening. These three aneurysms contained partially intraluminal thrombosis undetected at the time of treatment. We conclude that in coiled intracranial aneurysms packing above 24% protects against reopening by compaction in non-thrombosed aneurysms. Since intraluminal thrombosis may go undetected at the time of treatment, follow-up angiography is still warranted in aneurysms with packing densities greater than 24%.",The relation between packing and reopening in coiled intracranial aneurysms: a prospective study,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2005,16136261,['Angiography'],2.191780822,Angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.191780822,"['endovascular treatment', 'intracranial aneurysm', 'endovascular therapy', 'aneurysm', 'cerebral aneurysms', 'detachable coils']",aneurysms
436,434,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For patients with malignant gliomas, clinical data-including age, perioperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and tumor resection-and tumor imaging features-including necrosis and edema-have been found to correlate with survival. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of these results and determine whether other imaging features are useful in predicting survival. METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between 15 imaging variables obtained from contrast-enhanced MR imaging scans and survival in patients with grade III (n = 43) and grade IV (n = 110) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) gliomas. Image analysis was performed by 2 neuroradiologists who were blinded to clinical data. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival probabilities. Univariable Cox models were used to assess the impact of imaging features on survival. A recursive partitioning analysis also was performed. RESULTS. As expected, age and KPS scores had significant prognostic value for both tumor grades. The extent of resection was not a statistically meaningful predictor of survival. For GBM, univariable analysis revealed the following imaging features to be significant, (hazard ratios in parentheses): noncontrast-enhancing tumor (nCET, 0.55), edema (1.62), satellites (1.74), and multifocality (4.34). For grade III tumors, the Cox hazard ratio for necrosis was 4.43 (P = .014) and correlated with a poor outcome and survival rates comparable to GBM patients. Lack of nCET, multifocality, and satellite lesions also were correlated with shortened survival. CONCLUSION: Of 15 tumor imaging features in GBM patients, only nCET, edema, and multifocality/satellites are statistically significant prognostic indicators.

438,436,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Periventricular white matter (WM) areas are widely recognized as predilection sites for complex cellular damage after ischemia/reperfusion or inflammatory injury of the perinatal cerebrum. We analyzed histochemical and MR imaging properties of fiber architectonics and extracellular matrix (ECM) of periventricular areas to disclose the potential significance of topographically specific WM lesions for the neurodevelopmental outcome. METHODS: We combined histochemical methods for demonstration of fibers, axonal guidance molecules, and ECM with T1-weighted MR images on postmortem specimens aged 15 to 36 postovulatory weeks (POW) and T2-weighted MR images on in vivo fetuses aged 14 to 26 POW. RESULTS: The fiber architectonics of the fetal cerebrum display tangential axon strata in frontopolar and occipitopolar regions, whereas the central periventricular region contains crossroads of intersecting callosal (transverse), associative (sagittal), and thalamocortical/ corticofugal (radial) fiber bundles. In early preterms, crossroads contain hydrophylic ECM with axonal guidance molecules, and they are easily recognized as hypointensities on T1-weighted MR images or hyperintensities on T2-weighted MR images. After the 28 POW, tangential fetal fiber-architectonic stratification transforms into the corona radiata system; however, the growth of cortical pathways continues in crossroad areas, as indicated by the presence of ECM and their distinct MR imaging signal intensities. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of MR imaging with histochemical findings demonstrated the presence of periventricular fiber crossroads rich in ECM and axonal guidance molecules. We propose that, in perinatal WM lesions, periventricular WM crossroads represent a hitherto unrecognized and vulnerable cellular and topographic target in which combined damage of association-commissural and projection fibers may explain the complexity of cognitive, sensory, and motor deficit in survivors of periventricular WM lesions.","Structural, immunocytochemical, and MR imaging properties of periventricular crossroads of growing cortical pathways in preterm infants",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2005,16286422,['MRI'],2.4,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.4,"['white-matter injury', 'cortex', 'brain', 'leukomalacia', 'laminar organization']",wm

METHODS: From 1998 to 2003, 75 patients underwent percutaneous transluminal intracranial stent placement as a treatment for wide-necked intracranial aneurysms and atherosclerotic stenoses. The anatomy of the target lesions, technical details of the procedures, device functionality, procedure-related complications, and short-term outcomes were reviewed in a retrospective fashion. RESULTS: The clinical indications included wide-necked intracranial aneurysms (59) and atherosclerotic stenoses (16). The stent was successfully deployed in 92% of the patients (69 of 75 cases). In the remaining 6 cases, the causes of failed stent deployment included arterial tortuosities (2), stent migration (2), fracture of the stent (1), and arterial perforation (1).

Sixteen patients were asymptomatic, and mass effect of the aneuryms caused cranial nerve palsy in 6. Seven aneurysms showed regrowth after prior endovascular coiling. RESULTS: Postinterventional angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 18 aneurysms, and a small remnant was left in 4. Clinical and angiographic follow-up data are available in 19 patients (average follow-up, 13 months; range, 5-36 months).

449,447,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty in the upper cervical spine is a challenging procedure, and little is known about its therapeutic outcome. The purpose of this study was to assess the risks and benefits of percutaneous vertebroplasty for metastatic involvement of the axis. METHODS: From January 1994 to August 2004, 12 patients (mean age, 52.3 years) underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty via an anterolateral approach using fluoroscopic guidance for metastatic lesions involving the C2 vertebral body; pain intensity was scored on a scale ranging from 0.0 (no pain) to 10.0 (maximum pain intensity). Eight patients (66.7%) were followed up (mean, 6.9 months); 5 of them had percutaneous vertebroplasty indicated for pain control and spine stabilization and 3, for spine stabilization only. RESULTS: The mean volume of cement injected was 2.9 +/- 0.7 mL (range, 2.0-4.0 mL) with a mean vertebral filling of 60.7 +/- 14.6% (range, 25-80%). Cement leakage was detected in 7 treated vertebrae (58.3%). Pain improvement was achieved in 4/5 patients (80%). Spine stability was observed in 7 patients (87.5%), but 1 patient (12.5%) presented with a secondary spine deformity in association with partial vertebral filling. Two postprocedural clinical manifestations (16.7%) were observed: 1 patient (8.3%) had a transient occipital neuralgia and another (8.3%) had an ischemic stroke. Mortality and morbidity rates at mean follow-up were 0.0% and 12.5% (1 patient), respectively. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty of C2 metastases by an antero-lateral approach is an effective option in the treatment strategy of patients with metastases to C2. Nevertheless, it is a challenging procedure and may carry regional and even intracranial risks due to the proximity to the vertebral artery.",Percutaneous vertebroplasty for metastatic involvement of the axis,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2005,16091507,['CT'],1.89,CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,1.89,"['transoral approach', 'management', 'c2', 'percentage']",vertebroplasty

METHODS: Early rebleedings occurred in 6/431 (1.4%) consecutive patients after coiling of a ruptured aneurysm. Clinical condition at the time of treatment, aneurysm location and size, initial aneurysm occlusion, timing of coiling, and the presence of an adjacent intracerebral hematoma in the six patients with,early rebleedings were compared with the remaining 425 patients. RESULTS: Incidence of early rebleeding after coiling of a ruptured aneurysm was 1.4%, and mortality was 100%. Independent risk factors are the presence of an adjacent intracerebral hematoma and small aneurysm size. Dependant risk factors are location on the anterior communicating artery, initial incomplete aneurysm occlusion, and poor clinical condition at the time of treatment. CONCLUSION: Early rebleeding after coiling of ruptured aneurysms is a major concern, in particular because the mortality is very high. A more restricted postembolization anticoagulation strategy in high-risk aneurysms may possibly prevent the occurrence of this devastating event.","Early rebleeding after coiling of ruptured cerebral aneurysms: Incidence, morbidity, and risk factors",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2005,16091523,['CT'],2.49,CT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.49,"['intracranial aneurysms', 'pseudoaneurysm formation', 'endovascular']",aneurysms

METHODS: Angiograms, CT scans, and clinical information were retrospectively reviewed in 65 consecutive patients who underwent thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke. Clinical data included age, sex, time to treatment, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on presentation of symptoms, NIHSS score at the time of hospital discharge, and modified Rankin scale score at time of hospital discharge. Site of occlusion, scoring of anatomic extent of pial collaterals before thrombolysis, and recanalization (complete, partial, or no recanalization) were determined on angiography. Infarct volume was measured on CT scans performed 24-48 hours after treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (82%) qualified for review. Both infarct volume and discharge modified Rankin scale scores were significantly lower for patients with better pial collateral scores than those with worse pial collateral scores, regardless of whether they had complete (P < .0001) or partial (P = .0095) recanalization.

The MRA analysis was based on source images in combination with maximum intensity projections. The IADSA was used as the reference standard.

454,452,"Patients with supratentorial high-grade glioma underwent surgery within a vertically open 0.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) system to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative MR guidance in achieving gross-total resection. For 31 patients, preoperative clinical data and MR findings were consistent with the putative diagnosis of a high-grade glioma, in 23 cases in eloquent regions. Tumor resections were carried out within a 0.5-T MR SIGNA SP/i (GE Medical Systems, USA). The resection of the lesion was carried out using fully MR compatible neurosurgical equipment and was stopped at the point when the operation was considered complete by the surgeon viewing the operation field with the microscope. We repeated imaging to determine the residual tumor volume only visible with MRI. Areas of tissue that were abnormal on these images were localized in the bed of resection by using interactive MR guidance. The procedure of resection, imaging control and interactive image guidance was repeated where necessary. Almost all tissue with abnormal characteristics was resected, with the exception of tissue localized in eloquent brain areas. The diagnosis of glioblastoma was confirmed in all 31 cases. When comparing the tumor volume before resection and at the point where the neurosurgeon would otherwise have terminated surgery (""first control""), residual tumor tissue was detectable in 29/31 patients; the mean residual tumor volume was 30.7 +/- 24%. After repeated resections under interactive image guidance the mean residual tumor volume was 15.1%. At this step we found tumor remnants only in 20/31 patients. The perioperative morbidity (12.9%) was low. Twenty-seven patients underwent sufficient postoperative radiotherapy. We found a significant difference (log(rank)p=0.0037) in the mean survival times of the two groups with complete resection (n=10, median survival time 537 days) and incomplete resection (n=17, median survival time 237 days). The resection of primary glioblastoma multiforme under intraoperative MR guidance as demonstrated is a possibility to achieve a more complete removal of the tumor than with conventional techniques.

Our purpose was to compare, by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the patterns of cortical activation in patients with cognitive impairment after TBI and those of normal subjects. Cortical activation maps of 11 right-handed healthy control subjects and five TBI patients with cognitive impairment were recorded in response to a Stroop task during a block-designed fMRI experiment. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) was used for individual subjects and group analysis. In TBI patients and controls, cortical activation, found in similar regions of the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes, resembled patterns of activation documented in previous neuroimaging studies of the Stroop task in healthy controls. However, the TBI patients showed a relative decrease in ACC activity compared with the controls. Cognitive impairment in TBI patients seems to be associated with alterations in functional cerebral activity, especially less activation of the ACC.

The purpose of this study is to report an unusually high fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (D-av) in the cavity of the brain abscess compared with other cystic lesions. METHODS: We performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 12 patients with cystic intracranial lesions (pyogenic abscess, n = 5; cysticercus cysts, n = 2; and low-grade astrocytoma, n = 5). Mean FA, Dav from the lesion core, perifocal edema, and corresponding contralateral normal-appearing regions were measured and compared for relative changes in these parameters. In the abscess cases, we placed regions of interest on areas with FA > 0.2 and FA < 0.2 to get FA and D., values. RESULTS: There were two patterns of FA values in the abscess cavity in all five patients. Part of the abscess showed mean FA = 0.440 +/- 0.135, with D., = (0.993 +/- 0.185) X 10(-3) mm(2)/s, whereas other parts had FA = 0.131 +/- 0.039 with D-av = (0.824 +/- 0.183) X 10(-3) mm(2)/s.

460,458,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is useful in diagnosing bacterial brain abscesses, but DWI features of fungal brain abscesses have not been characterized. Because fungal abscesses are not purulent, we hypothesized that their DWI characteristics are distinct from those of bacterial abscesses. METHODS: We reviewed clinical, neuropathologic and neuroimaging findings of patients with fungal brain infections due to Aspergillus (n = 6), Rhizopus (n = 1), or Scedosporium (n = 1) species. DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained before definitive diagnosis and antifungal therapy. ADC ratios (lesion/contralateral white matter) were calculated. RESULTS: Two patients had a rapidly progressive, fatal course, with cerebritis and acute inflammation; fungal organisms were largely restricted to vessels. Lesions were predominantly nonenhancing and had heterogeneous foci of restricted diffusion. Six patients with subacute neurologic presentations had acute or chronic inflammation, capsule formation, focal necrosis, and fungal organisms disseminated throughout the lesion. Their abscesses were ring enhancing. In five, lesions had restricted diffusion in the central nonenhancing portions. The sixth patient had a lesion with a peripheral rim of restricted diffusion but elevated central diffusion; histopathology showed early abscess formation.

METHODS: LSDWI was prospectively performed in 39 patients with SCC and in 14 patients with lymphoma. Images were obtained with a diffusion-weighted factor (b factor) of 5 and 1000 s/mm(2), and ADC maps were generated. ADC values were measured for the two types of tumor.

463,461,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important in patient assessment and prognosis, yet they are underestimated with conventional imaging techniques. We used MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to detect DAI and determine whether metabolite ratios are accurate in predicting long-term outcomes and to examine regional differences in injury between children with TBI and control subjects. METHODS: Forty children with TBI underwent transverse proton MRSI through the level of the corpus callosum within 1-16 days after injury. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and susceptibility-weighted MR imaging was used to identify voxels as normal-appearing or as nonhemorrhagic or hemorrhagic injury. Neurologic outcome was evaluated at 6-12 months after injury. Metabolite ratios for total (all voxels), normal-appearing, and hemorrhagic brain were compared and used in a logistic regression model to predict long-term outcome. Total and regional metabolite ratios were compared with control data. RESULTS: A significant decrease in N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and increase in choline (Cho)/Cr (evidence of DAI) was observed in normal-appearing (P <.05) and visibly injured (hemorrhagic) brain (P <.001) compared with controls. In normal-appearing brain NAA/Cr decreased more in patients with poor outcomes (1.32 +/- 0.54) than in those with good outcomes (1.61 +/- 0.50, P =.01) or control subjects (1.86 +/- 0.1, P =.00). In visibly injured brains, ratios were similarly altered in all patients. In predicting outcomes, ratios from normal-appearing and visibly-injured brain were 85% and 67% accurate, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution and relationship of the MR-derived relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), lactate (Lac), and mobile lipids (Lip), which have been proposed as markers for these phenomena of gliomas in vivo. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were examined before surgical biopsy and/or resection (seven grade II, rive grade III, and II grade IV), and 27 patients were studied after surgery but before radiation treatment and/or chemotherapy (11 grade II, two grade III, and 14 grade IV gliomas). Lac and Lip were estimated from Lac-edited three-dimensional MR spectroscopic images. Dynamic susceptibility-contrast MR imaging was applied to obtain perfusion-weighted images and rCBV maps. RESULTS: Before surgical biopsy/resection, one low-grade and 12 of 16 high-grade gliomas had significantly elevated Lac. No low-grade and 10 of 16 high-grade gliomas had significantly elevated Lip. In presurgical high-grade gliomas, volumes of elevated Lip and macronecrosis were significantly correlated. rCBV was significantly increased in regions with elevated Lac. After we excluded macronecrosis, the rCBV for regions with elevated Lip but no Lac was significantly higher than rCBV in regions with elevated Lac but no Lip. After surgical biopsy/ resection, more low-grade patients showed significantly elevated Lac and Lip than before. CONCLUSION. The in vivo distribution of rCBV, Lac, and Lip, as evaluated with three-dimensional MR spectroscopic imaging, may help in the diagnosis and selection of the most appropriate therapy for patients with gliomas.","Relationship of MR-derived lactate, mobile lipids, and relative blood volume for gliomas in vivo",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2005,15814918,['MRP'],2.49,MRP,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.49,"['localized proton spectroscopy', 'magnetic-resonance spectroscopy']",tumor

Seventy-two aneurysms were treated with predominantly helical-shaped coils of 0.010-inch-diameter wire, and 72 aneurysms were treated with predominantly complex-shaped coils of 0.012-inch-diameter wire. Aneurysm volume was assessed from three-dimensional angiography. Aneurysm packing, inserted coil lengths, and numbers of coils were compared for both types of coils. RESULTS: Mean packing was significantly higher (absolute value, 6.4%; relative value, 26.6%; P < .0001) in aneurysms coiled with 0.012-inch-diameter coils than aneurysms coiled with 0.010-inch-diameter coils.

METHODS: Contrast-enhanced MR angiography was performed in 47 patients at 6 and 12 months after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms (48 aneurysms). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was used as reference and was performed at 12 months after the treatment in all patients. MR angiographs were analyzed independently by two senior radiologists. DSA and MR angiography findings were assigned into one of three categories: complete obliteration, residual neck, or residual aneurysm. RESULTS: All examinations were assessable. Interobserver agreement was judged as very good for contrast-enhanced MR angiography (kappa = 0.96), with one discrepancy between examiners. Comparison between MR angiography at 6 months and DSA at 12 months showed an excellent agreement between techniques (kappa = 0.93). Two cases of complete occlusion at DSA were misclassified as a residual neck at 6-month MR angiography. All aneurysm recanalizations at DSA already were detected on MR angiography at 6 months.

METHODS: Two groups of 30 patients with mild AD of different ages of onset were examined. Mean ages in the early- and late-onset groups were 60.2 +/- 5.2 and 71.5 +/- 2.6 years, respectively. Control subjects were aged-matched healthy volunteers. Regions of gray matter loss in early- and late-onset AD were examined with VBM. Diagnostic performance of Z score images obtained with the VBM method was evaluated in patients and control subjects by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)). RESULTS: Both AD groups had significantly reduced gray matter in the bilateral medial temporal regions. In addition, the early-onset group had more severe gray matter loss in the bilateral parietal and posterior cingulate cortices and precuneus region.

475,473,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Small emboli arising from a friable plaque during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stent placement (CAS) constitute a potentially important cause of periprocedural ischemic complications. To evaluate the frequency and significance of cerebral ischemic lesions of embolic origin after CEA and CAS, we examined patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis by using diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging. METHODS: Twenty-four patients undergoing 26 CEAs and 20 patients undergoing 22 CAS were prospectively studied with pre- and post-treatment DW imaging of the brain within 7 days (mean, 2.3 days) before and within 7 days (mean, 3.2 days) after treatment. DW images were analyzed by two neuroradiologists blinded to the clinical results after CEA and CAS. Any new hyperintense lesion on DW image was interpreted as a post-treatment ischemic lesion. We compared post-treatment ischemic lesions with change in neurologic status, presence of plaque ulcerations, and severity of stenosis and compared the frequency of overall post-treatment complications between the two procedures. RESULTS: In 25 (96%) of 26 CEAs, post-operative brain DW images were unchanged. In one patient (4%), a new single asymptomatic hyperintensity was observed in the striatocapsule on the surgical side. In 14 (64%) of 22 CAS procedures, post-operative brain DW images were unchanged. In eight CAS cases (36%), new hyperintensities were seen on DW images. Among them, two were symptomatic with a major neurologic deficit lasting more than 7 days. Post-treatment brain or retinal major stroke rates were 4% (n = 1) for CEA and 14% (n = 3) for CAS. Overall symptomatic complication rates were 19.2% and 13.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION. Rate of ischemic brain lesions was significantly lower after CEA than after CAS, although most of these brain lesions were silent. Also, CEA is a safer procedure carrying a lower risk of post-operative cerebral ischemia.

Fifteen patients underwent endovascular treatment with either parent artery occlusion ( 13 patients) or aneurysmal coil occlusion with preservation of the parent artery ( 2 patients). Re-bleeding occurred within 12 days and before treatment in nine patients. Eight of these had a pseudoaneurysm. No patient bled after endovascular treatment. Poor grade and early re-bleeding were associated with less favorable outcome. Outcome at 6 months did not differ significantly between endovascular and conservative treatment. Altogether, good recovery was achieved for 16 patients, moderate disability was seen in one, severe disability in four, and eight patients ( 27%) died. The absence of bleeding subsequent to endovascular treatment in this study suggests that endovascular treatment may be a rational approach in these patients at high risk of re-bleeding, especially those with a pseudoaneurysm.",Vertebrobasilar dissection with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a retrospective study of 29 patients,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2005,15711986,['angiography'],2.191780822,angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.191780822,"['dissection', 'vertebrobasilar arteries', 'subarachnoid hemorrhage', 'posteroinferior cerebellar artery', 'intracranial vertebral artery']",hemorrhage
478,476,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the early stage of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), conventional MR imaging parameters such as T2 lesion load fail to explain the clinical status of patients. In the present work, we aimed to determine the ability of magnification transfer imaging to better reflect the relationship between local tissue damage and functional status of MS patients. METHODS: We performed a comparative statistical mapping analysis on brain tissue magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) data measured in 18 patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS (CISSMS) and 18 matched control subjects. RESULTS: In the patients with CISSMS, a pattern of significant low MTR values was observed in the white matter, corpus callosum, bilateral occipitofrontal fascicles, right fornix, right parietal white matter, external capsule, right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, optica radiata, parietal white matter, right cingulum, gray matter, bilateral thalamus, bilateral caudate, right insula, and left Brodmann area (BA) 8. No correlation was found between local MTR decrease and Expanded Disability Status Scale score. Significant correlations between MTR and MS Functional Composite scores (Spearman rank test, P < .05) were observed in the left BA40, right SLF, right frontal white matter, splenium, and anterior corpus callosum. Local MTR values correlated with Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test scores in the left BA40, right BA4, right SLF, and splenium. CONCLUSION: Statistical mapping analysis of brain MTR data provides valuable information on the relationship between the location of brain tissue damage and its functional impact in patients with MS, even in the earliest stage of the disease.",Local tissue damage assessed with statistical mapping analysis of brain magnetization transfer ratio: Relationship with functional status of patients in the earliest stage of multiple sclerosis,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,Article,2005,15661713,['MRI'],2.4,MRI,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,2.4,"['cortex', 'axon', 'thalamic', 'white matter']",wm
479,477,"The aim of this paper was to determine the correlation between calcium burden ( expressed as a volume) and extent of stenosis of the origin of the artery (ICA) by CT angiography (CTA). Previous studies have shown that calcification in the coronary arteries correlates with significant vessel stenosis, and severe calcification ( measured by CT) in the carotid siphon correlates with significant ( greater than 50% stenosis) as determined angiographically. Sixty-one patients ( age range 50-85 years) underwent CT of the neck with intravenous administration of iodinated contrast for a variety of conditions. Images were obtained with a helical multidetector array CT scanner and reviewed on a three-dimensional workstation. A single observer manipulated window and level to segment calcified plaque from vascular enhancement in order to quantify vascular calcium volume ( cc) in the region of the bifurcation of the common carotid artery/ICA origin, and to measure the extent of ICA stenosis near the origin. A total of 117 common carotid artery bifurcations were reviewed. A ""significant'' stenosis was defined arbitrarily as > 40% ( to detect lesions before they become hemodynamically significant) of luminal diameter on CTA using NASCET-like criteria. All ""significant'' stenoses ( 21 out of 117 carotid bifurcations) had measurable calcium. We found a relatively strong correlation between percent stenosis and the calcium volume (Pearson's r = 0.65, P < 0.0001). We also found that there was an even stronger correlation between the square root of the calcium volume and the percent stenosis as measured by CTA (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001). Calcium volumes of 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 cc were used as thresholds to evaluate for a ""significant'' stenosis. A receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve demonstrated that thresholds of 0.06 cc ( sensitivity 88%, specificity 87%) and 0.03 cc ( sensitivity 94%, specificity 76%) generated the best combinations of sensitivity and speci. city. Hence, this preliminary study demonstrates a relatively strong relationship between volume of calcium at the carotid bifurcation in the neck ( measured by CT) and percent stenosis of the ICA below the skull base ( as measured by CTA). Use of calcium volume measurements as a threshold may be both sensitive and speci. c for the detection of significant ICA stenosis. The significance of the correlation between calcium volume and ICA stenosis is that potentially a ""score'' can be obtained that will identify those at risk for high grade carotid stenosis.",Carotid bifurcation calcium and correlation with percent stenosis of the internal carotid artery on CT angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,Article; Proceedings Paper,2005,15650832,"['Angiography', 'CT']",2.054794521,Angiography,NEURORADIOLOGY,2.054794521,"['calcification', 'computed tomography (ct)', 'ct', 'carotid arteries', 'digital-subtraction-angiography', 'magnetic-resonance angiography', 'calcium']",stenosis
