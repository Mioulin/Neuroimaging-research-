AB Objectives/Hypothesis: The prevalence of multiglandular disease (MGD) of the parathyroid has been reported to be higher in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and low baseline intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (<100 pg/mL). Low baseline PTH is associated with lower localization rate and positive predictive value with both preoperative sestamibi and ultrasound. This study sought to evaluate our experience with four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) for the localization of abnormal parathyroid glands, including MGD, in patients with low baseline intact PTH (LBiPTH). Study
   Design: A single institution case series.
   Methods: A case series of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism with low baseline PTH or an inconclusive sestamibi, who underwent surgery with a single surgeon from April 2012 to June 2015 following 4D-CT to help with abnormal gland localization.
   Results: We identified 14 patients who underwent a 4D-CT in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism and LBiPTH. A sestamibi scan had been ordered in 71% and was inconclusive in all cases. No ultrasound was performed. In all patients, 4D-CT was 84.6% sensitive in localizing abnormal glands, yielding a positive predictive value of 91.7%. Overall, 42.9% of patients had evidence of MGD, and 4D-CT detected 83.3% of MGD cases. A focused unilateral exploration was performed in 28.6% of cases, and a four-gland exploration was performed in all remaining patients.
   Conclusions: In patients with hypercalcemia and LBiPTH, with higher likelihood of MGD and of inconclusive results on sestamibi, 4D-CT may be a superior modality for localizing smaller adenoma or multiple hypercellular glands. This may allow for improved interpretation of intraoperative PTH results, and in a minority of cases, a focused parathyroid exploration.

TI WEB-DL Endovascular Treatment of Wide-Neck Bifurcation Aneurysms:
   Long-Term Results in a European Series
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; FLOW-DISRUPTION; TRIAL; FEASIBILITY; DEVICE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow disruption with the WEB-DL device has been used safely for the treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. The stability of aneurysm occlusion after this treatment was evaluated in the short and midterm, but not in the long term. This retrospective multicenter European study is the continuation of an already published series dealing with short- and midterm anatomic results and analyzes long-term data in patients treated with the WEB-DL
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve European neurointerventional centers initially participated in the study. In addition to data collected for the initial publication, images obtained at long-term follow-up were collected and independently analyzed by the same experienced interventional neuroradiologist.
   RESULTS: Of the initial 45 patients, 26 (20 women and 6 men; 35-73 years of age; mean, 55.2 +/- 10.6 years; median, 55.5 years) with 26 aneurysms treated with the WEB-DL device had long-term follow-up (median, 27.4 months). Three of 26 patients (11.5%) were retreated between short- and midterm follow-up, and none, between mid- and long-term follow-up. Long-term aneurysm occlusion in the 19 patients treated with the WEB only and not retreated during follow-up was complete occlusion in 13/19 patients (68.4%), including aneurysms with opacification of the proximal recess in 9/19 patients (47.4%), neck remnant in 3/19 patients (15.8%), and aneurysm remnant in 3/19 patients (15.8%). In all patients (100.0%), aneurysm occlusion was stable between midterm and long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that WEB treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms offers long-term stable occlusion.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate whether early changes in tumor volume and perfusion measurements derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) may predict response to antiangiogenic therapy in recurrent high-grade gliomas.
   Twenty-seven patients who received bevacizumab every 3 weeks were enrolled in the study. For each patient, three MRI scans were performed: at baseline, after the first dose, and after the fourth dose of bevacizumab. The entire tumor volume (V-tot), as well as contrast-enhanced and noncontrast-enhanced tumor subvolumes (VCE-T1 and VNON-CE-T1, respectively) were outlined using post-contrast T1-weighted images as a guide for the tumor location. Histogram analysis of normalized IAUGC (nIAUGC) and transfer constant K-trans maps were performed. Each patient was classified as a responder patient if he/she had a partial response or a stable disease or as a nonresponder patient if he/she had progressive disease.
   Responding patients showed a larger reduction in VNON-CE-T1 after a single dose, compared to nonresponding patients. Tumor subvolumes with increased values of nIAUGC and K-trans, after a single dose, significantly differed between responders and nonresponders. The radiological response was found to be significantly associated to the clinical outcome. After a single dose, V-tot was predictive of overall survival (OS), while VCE-T1 showed a tendency of correlation with OS.
   Tumor subvolumes with increased nIAUGC and K-trans showed the potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy of DCE. Early assessments of the entire tumor volume, including necrotic areas, may provide complementary information of tumor behavior in response to anti-VEGF therapies and is worth further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) subjects show brain injury in sites that control autonomic, cognitive, and mood functions that are deficient in the condition. The processes contributing to injury may include altered blood-brain barrier (BBB) actions. Our aim was to examine BBB function, based on diffusion-weighted pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DW-pCASL) procedures, in OSA compared to controls.
   METHODSWe performed DW-pCASL imaging in nine OSA and nine controls on a 3.0-Tesla MRI scanner. Global mean gray and white matter arterial transient time (ATT, an index of large artery integrity), water exchange rate across the BBB (Kw, BBB function), DW-pCASL ratio, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) values were compared between OSA and control subjects.
   RESULTSGlobal mean gray and white matter ATT (OSA vs. controls; gray matter, 1.691 .120 vs. 1.658 +/- .109 second, P = .49; white matter, 1.700 +/- .115 vs. 1.650 +/- .114 second, P = .44), and CBF values (gray matter, 57.4 +/- 15.8 vs. 58.2 +/- 10.7 ml/100 g/min, P = .67; white matter, 24.2 +/- 7.0 vs. 24.6 +/- 6.7 ml/100 g/min, P = .91) did not differ significantly, but global gray and white matter Kw (gray matter, 158.0 +/- 28.9 vs. 220.8 +/- 40.6 min(-1), P = .002; white matter, 177.5 +/- 57.2 vs. 261.1 +/- 51.0 min(-1), P = .006), and DW-pCASL ratio (gray matter, .727 +/- .076 vs. .823 +/- .069, P = .011; white matter, .722 +/- .144 vs. .888 +/- .100, P = .004) values were significantly reduced in OSA over controls.
   CONCLUSIONSOSA subjects show compromised BBB function, but intact large artery integrity. The BBB alterations may introduce neural damage contributing to abnormal functions in OSA, and suggest a need to repair BBB function with strategies commonly used in other fields.

   VISUALIZATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the early stages of idiopathic Parkinson disease, motor symptoms are usually asymmetric. We aimed to assess the feasibility of nigrosome 1 detection at 3T MR imaging to analyze the agreement of its asymmetry and clinical laterality.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution 3D multiecho imaging was performed at 31 MR imaging in 13 healthy subjects and 24 patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease confirmed by N-3-fluoropropy1-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (F-18-FP-CIT) PET. The nigrosome 1 detection findings by using the MR imaging data were rated as "normal," "possibly abnormal," and "abnormal" by 2 independent reviewers. The degree of F-18-FP-CIT binding was visually assessed in the caudate nucleus and putamen on PET images. Clinical laterality was evaluated by scores of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Part III. Asymmetry of the affected nigrosome 1 and the degree of F-18-FP-CIT binding were analyzed for agreement with clinical laterality.
   RESULTS: The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the nigrosome 1 detection at 3T MR imaging was 100%, 84.6%, and 94.6%, respectively. Interrater agreements for the abnormality and asymmetry of nigrosome 1 were excellent (kappa = 0.863 and 0.835, respectively). In patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease, the agreement of asymmetry between clinical laterality and nigrosome 1 detection was good (kappa = 0.724). The degree of the F-18-FP-CIT PET binding showed fair agreement (kappa = 0.235) with clinical laterality.
   CONCLUSIONS: The abnormality involving nigrosome 1 can be detected at 3T MR imaging with an accuracy of 94.6%. The clinical laterality is in high concordance with the laterality of the nigrosome 1 detection at 3T (kappa = 0.724).

TI Carotid Webs and Recurrent Ischemic Strokes in the Era of CT Angiography
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ATYPICAL FIBROMUSCULAR HYPERPLASIA; ARTERY WEB; DYSPLASIA; STENOSIS;
   FOLD
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid webs may cause recurrent ischemic stroke. We describe the prevalence, demographics, clinical presentation, imaging features, histopathology, and stroke risk associated with this under-recognized lesion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A carotid web was defined on CTA as a thin intraluminat filling defect along the posterior wall of the carotid bulb just beyond the carotid bifurcation on oblique sagittal section CTA that was seen as a septum on axial CTA. Using a prospective case series from April 2013 to April 2014, we describe the demographics, spectrum of imaging features on CTA, and histopathology of these carotid webs. From a retrospective analysis of patients at our center from May 2012 to April 2013 who had a baseline head and neck CTA followed by a brain MR imaging within 1-2 days of the CTA, we determine the period prevalence of carotid webs and the prevalence of ipsilateral stroke on imaging.
   RESULTS: In the prospective series, the mean age was 50 years (range, 41-55 years); 5/7 patients were women. Recurrent stroke was seen in 5/7 (71.4%) patients with the carotid web; time to recurrence ranged from 1 to 97 months. Histopathology suggested a high probability of fibromuscular dysptasia. In the retrospective series, carotid webs were seen in 7/576 patients for a hospital-based-period prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI, 0.4%-2.5%). Two of these 7 patients had acute stroke in the vascular territory of the carotid web.
   CONCLUSIONS: A carotid web may contribute to recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with no other determined stroke mechanism. Intimal variant fibromuscular dysplasia is the pathologic diagnosis in most cases. The prevalence of carotid web is low, while the optimal management strategy remains unknown.

AB ObjectiveTo compare corpus callosum area (CCA) and corpus callosum index (CCI) in terms of feasibility and their performance as biomarkers for cognitive and physical disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). A secondary aim was to compare these two methods with volumetric measurements.
   MethodsThis study was based on a cohort of 37 MS patients and a group of age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Physical disability was assessed with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and cognitive disability with the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). CCA and CCI were assessed on midsagittal brain MRI by 3 raters with varying radiological experience. Volumes of the brain, gray and white matter, corpus callosum, and MS lesions were acquired with Freesurfer and Lesion Segmentation Toolbox for Statistical Parametric Mapping.
   ResultsCCA and CCI were obtained within seconds with excellent intra- and inter-rater agreement, and outperformed volumetric measurements. CCA had the strongest correlations with both SDMT (r = .82, P < .001) and EDSS (r = -.56, P < .001), and the highest accuracy in differentiating patients from controls (95%) and relapse-remitting MS from progressive forms of MS (77%). CCI performed less well (r = .73, P < .001; r = -.45, P < .001; 94%; 71%). CCA also outperformed the volumetric measurements in these regards.
   ConclusionsCCA is a time-effective and robust biomarker that has stronger correlations with both EDSS and information processing speed than CCI and volumetric measurements that are commonly used as outcome measures in MS research and clinical trials.

AB The aim of this study is to identify disease-specific changes of the thalamus, basal ganglia, pons, and midbrain in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) using diffusion tensor imaging and volumetric analysis.
   MRI diffusion and volumetric data were acquired in a derivation of 30 controls and 8 patients with PSP and a validation cohort comprised of controls (n = 21) and patients with PSP (n = 27), PD (n = 10), and MSA-P (n = 11). Analysis was performed using regions of interest (ROI), tract-based spatial statistic (TBSS), and tractography and results compared between diagnostic groups.
   In the derivation cohort, we observed increased mean diffusivity (MD) in the thalamus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and the midbrain in PSP compared to controls. Furthermore, volumetric analysis showed reduced thalamic volumes in PSP. In the validation cohort, the observations of increased MD were replicated by ROI-based analysis and in the thalamus by TBSS-based analysis. Such differences were not found for patients with PD in any of the cohorts. Tractography of the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTT) showed increased MD in PSP patients from both cohorts compared to controls and in the validation cohort in PSP compared to PD and MSA patients. Increased MD in the thalamus and along the DRTT correlated with disease stage and motor function in PSP.
   Patients with PSP, but not PD or MSA-P, exhibit signs of structural abnormalities in the thalamus and in the DRTT. These changes are associated with disease stage and impaired motor function.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low-profile self-expandable stents were recently introduced for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. This study investigated the initial and midterm clinical and angiographic results of LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling in the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who were treated with LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling. Eighty patients with 80 wide-neck intracranial aneurysms were included in the study. Eleven patients (13.8%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. All patients were treated with LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling. Technical success and immediate postprocedural clinical and angiographic outcomes were evaluated. Seventy-three patients attended angiographic and clinical follow-up for a mean duration of 7.2 +/- 3.8 months. Periprocedural and delayed complications were reviewed. Preprocedural and follow-up clinical statuses were assessed by using the modified Rankin Scale.
   RESULTS: The technical success rate of the procedure was 97.5%. The immediate postprocedural angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the aneurysm in 75% of the 80 patients. The last follow-up angiograms showed complete occlusion in 85.7% of the 77 patients with an angiographic follow-up. Of the 77 patients with a follow-up angiography, 6.5% showed an increase in the filling status of the aneurysm and 5.2% required retreatment. The overall procedure-related complication rate, including asymptomatic complications, was 11.3%. The permanent morbidity rate was 3.8%. There was no mortality in this study.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrates the relative safety, efficacy, and midterm durability of the LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling procedure for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms.

AB Imaging has an essential role in the evaluation of correct positioning of electrodes implanted for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Although MRI offers superior anatomic visualization of target sites, there are safety concerns in patients with implanted material; imaging guidelines are inconsistent and vary. The fusion of postoperative CT with preoperative MRI images can be an alternative for the assessment of electrode positioning. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of measurements realized on fused images (acquired without a stereotactic frame) using a manufacturer-provided software.
   Data from 23 Parkinson's disease patients who underwent bilateral electrode placement for subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS were acquired. Preoperative high-resolution T2-weighted sequences at 3 T, and postoperative CT series were fused using a commercially available software. Electrode tip position was measured on the obtained images in three directions (in relation to the midline, the AC-PC line and an AC-PC line orthogonal, respectively) and assessed in relation to measures realized on postoperative 3D T1 images acquired at 1.5 T.
   Mean differences between measures carried out on fused images and on postoperative MRI lay between 0.17 and 0.97 mm.
   Fusion of CT and MRI images provides a safe and fast technique for postoperative assessment of electrode position in DBS.

   MIDTERM; SAFETY; HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the increasing use of stent-assisted coiling for ruptured intracranial aneurysms, there is little consensus regarding the appropriate antiplatelet administration for this. The objectives of this systematic review were to provide an overview of complications and their association with the method of antiplatelet administration in stent-assisted coiling for ruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of the literature in the data bases was conducted to identify studies reporting complications of stent-assisted coiling for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The pooled event rate of preprocedural thromboembolisms, hemorrhages, and mortality was estimated from the selected studies. Subgroup analyses were performed by the method of antiplatelet administration (pre-, postprocedural, and modified). Meta-analysis was conducted to compare periprocedural complications and mortality between ruptured intracranial aneurysms and unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   RESULTS: Of the 8476 studies identified, 33 with 1090 patients were included. The event rates of thromboembolism and intra- and postprocedural hemorrhage were 11.2% (95% CI, 9.2%-13.6%), 5.4% ( 95% CI, 4.1%-7.2%), and 3.6% ( 95% CI, 2.6%-5.1%), respectively. Subgroup analyses of thromboembolism showed a statistically significant difference between groups (P < .05). In the preprocedural and modified antiplatelet groups, the risk for thromboembolism in stent-assisted coiling for ruptured intracranial aneurysm was not significantly different from that for unruptured intracranial aneurysm, though this risk of the postprocedural antiplatelet group was significantly higher in ruptured intracranial aneurysms than in unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of current evidence, complications of stent-assisted coiling for ruptured intracranial aneurysm may be affected by the method of antiplatelet administration.

AB PURPOSETo examine intermethod reliabilities and differences between FreeSurfer and the FDA-cleared congener, NeuroQuant (R), both fully automated methods for structural brain MRI measurements.
   MATERIALS AND METHODSMRI scans from 20 normal control subjects, 20 Alzheimer's disease patients, and 20 mild traumatically brain-injured patients were analyzed with NeuroQuant (R) and with FreeSurfer. Intermethod reliability was evaluated.
   RESULTSPairwise correlation coefficients, intraclass correlation coefficients, and effect size differences were computed. NeuroQuant (R) versus FreeSurfer measures showed excellent to good intermethod reliability for the 21 regions evaluated (r: .63 to .99/ICC: .62 to .99/ES: -.33 to 2.08) except for the pallidum (r/ICC/ES = .31/.29/-2.2) and cerebellar white matter (r/ICC/ES = .31/.31/.08). Volumes reported by NeuroQuant were generally larger than those reported by FreeSurfer with the whole brain parenchyma volume reported by NeuroQuant 6.50% larger than the volume reported by FreeSurfer. There was no systematic difference in results between the 3 subgroups.
   CONCLUSIONNeuroQuant (R) and FreeSurfer showed good to excellent intermethod reliability in volumetric measurements for all brain regions examined with the only exceptions being the pallidum and cerebellar white matter. This finding was robust for normal individuals, patients with Alzheimer's disease, and patients with mild traumatic brain injury.

AB OBJECTIVESThe clinical implications of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been thoroughly examined. To address this, we investigated the spatial distribution of WMH and their regional predilection in non-demented patients with mild PD.
   METHODSCognitive assessments classified the sample into patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n = 25) and patients with no cognitive impairment (PD-NCI, n = 65) based on the recent formal Movement Disorder Task Force diagnostic criteria. The mean age was 65.1 7.7 years, disease duration was 5.3 3.9 years, and Hoehn and Yahr stage was 1.9 +/- .4. WMHs were outlined on T2-weighted imaging using a semi-automated technique. The spatial distribution of WMHs were compared between PD-MCI and PD-NCI using voxel-wise lesion probability maps (LPM). General linear models examined the associations between spatially specific WMHs and cognitive domains.
   RESULTSLPM analyses showed significant differences in the spatial distribution of WMH in PD-MCI compared to PD-NCI in widespread regions of the brain (P < .05). PD-MCI demonstrated significantly greater total and periventricular WMHs compared to PD-NCI (P .02). Spatial distribution of WMHs was also significantly associated with global cognition, performance on the Frontal Assessment Battery and Fruit Fluency (P < .05).
   CONCLUSIONSVoxel-wise LPM analysis revealed differences in the spatial distribution of WMH between PD-MCI and PD-NCI patients, particularly in the periventricular regions. A more widespread extent of WMH might be indicative of cognitive deterioration. Our findings warrant further longitudinal investigation into the importance of WMH spatial distribution as a predictor for conversion from PD to PD with dementia.

TI Intrasaccular Flow Disruption in Acutely Ruptured Aneurysms: A
   Multicenter Retrospective Review of the Use of the WEB

DT Article
ID UNRUPTURED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; ENDOVASCULAR
   TREATMENT; RISK; PREVALENCE; REGION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Use of the WEB intra-aneurysmal flow-disruption device in unruptured wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms has proven safety and efficacy. However, ruptured aneurysms are underrepresented in existing studies. This retrospective multicenter study describes the use of the WEB in patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten centers contributed to this study. Clinical and procedural data of 47 patients with 52 aneurysms were analyzed retrospectively together with follow-up angiographies.
   RESULTS: There were 37 anterior and 15 posterior circulation aneurysms with a neck size of >= 4 mm in 49 of 52 (94%) aneurysms; 45 (87%) aneurysms were <10 mm, and 2 were partially thrombosed. Successful placement of the WEB was possible in every case. Adjunctive devices were used in 8 of 52 (15%) aneurysms. Thromboembolic events were observed in 4 of 52 (8%) patients. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients with 16 aneurysms, 9 of which were potentially related to the WEB procedure (3 thromboembolic events, 5 protrusions, and 1 perforations; 2 perforations were caused by the wire or catheter), but none had a clinical impact. Four patients were retreated. Short-term follow-up in 25 of 39 patients revealed complete occlusion in 15 of 25 (60%), 5 of 25 (20%) with residual neck, and 5 of 25 (20%) with residual aneurysm filling. Short-to midterm imaging in 9 of 25 patients revealed complete occlusion in 5 (55.6%), residual neck in 2 (22%), and residual aneurysm filling in 2 (22%). Of 47 patients, 23 (49%) had an mRS score of 0, 1, or 2; 13 (28%) had an mRS score of 3 or 4; and none had an mRS score of 5 at discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective series showed good procedural safety, feasibility, and stability of midterm occlusion in ruptured wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSETo determine whether lesion to activation distance (LAD) on presurgical blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and degree of white matter involvement by primary or metastatic brain lesions predict perioperative motor and language deficits.
   METHODSWe retrospectively evaluated 76 patients with intra-axial brain lesions referred for presurgical fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We measured expressive, receptive, global language and motor LAD and assessed degree of involvement of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). We performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to determine whether the LAD and the degree of CST/SLF involvement were statistically significantly different between patients with and without preoperative or postoperative neurological deficits.
   RESULTSIn preoperatively symptomatic patients, motor and expressive language LAD were significantly lower (z = -3.78, P = .0002, and z = -2.51, P = .01, respectively) than in asymptomatic patients. No significant difference was noted in LAD between postoperative symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, except for a trend level effect for motor LAD (P = .07). The degree of CST involvement was significantly different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (z = 3.40, P = .0007 and z = 2.97, P = .003, respectively, for pre- and postoperative motor deficits).The degree of SLF involvement was significantly different between preoperatively (but not postoperatively) symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (z = 2.85, P = .004).
   CONCLUSIONPresurgical motor and expressive language LAD as well as degree of tract involvement on DTI are predictive of preoperative but not postoperative deficits, except for CST DTI and (trend level) motor LAD; inability of language LAD to predict postoperative deficits suggests that preoperative fMRI is valuable to neurosurgeons in avoiding resection of eloquent cortex.

TI Mean Diffusional Kurtosis in Patients with Glioma: Initial Results with

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusional kurtosis imaging is an MR imaging technique that provides microstructural information in biologic systems. Its application in clinical studies, however, is hampered by long acquisition and postprocessing times. Weevaluated a new and fast (2 minutes 46 seconds) diffusional kurtosis imaging method with regard to glioma grading, compared it with conventional diffusional kurtosis imaging, and compared the diagnostic accuracy of fast mean kurtosis (MK') to that of the widely used mean diffusivity.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: MK' and mean diffusivity were measured in the contrast-enhancing tumor core, the perifocal hyperintensity (indicated on T2 FLAIR images), and the contralateral normal-appearing white and gray matter of 34 patients (22 with high-grade and 12 with low-grade gliomas). MK' and mean diffusivity in the different tumor grades were compared by using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the areas under the curve were calculated to determine the diagnostic accuracy of MK' and mean diffusivity.
   RESULTS: MK' in the tumor core, but not mean diffusivity, differentiated high-grade from low-grade gliomas, and MK' differentiated glioblastomas from the remaining gliomas with high accuracy (area under the curve(MK') = 0.842; P-MK' < .001). MK' and mean diffusivity identified glioblastomas in the group of high-grade gliomas with similar significance and accuracy (area under the curve(MK') = 0.886; area under the curve(mean diffusivity) = 0.876; P-MK' = .003; P-mean diffusivity = .004). The mean MK' in all tissue types was comparable to that obtained by conventional diffusional kurtosis imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: The diffusional kurtosis imaging approach used here is considerably faster than conventional diffusional kurtosis imaging methods but yields comparable results. It can be accommodated in clinical protocols and enables exploration of the role of MK' as a biomarker in determining glioma subtypes or response evaluation.

TI Optimal Virtual Monochromatic Images for Evaluation of Normal Tissues
   and Head and Neck Cancer Using Dual-Energy CT
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; OPTIMIZATION; ARTIFACTS; LARYNGEAL; IMPROVE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dual-energy CT is not used routinely for evaluation of the head and neck, and there is no consensus on the optimal virtual monochromatic image energies for evaluating normal tissues or head and neck cancer. We performed a quantitative evaluation to determine the optimal virtual monochromatic images for visualization of normal tissues, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and lymphadenopathy.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual-energy CT scans from 10 healthy patients and 30 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated at different virtual monochromatic energy levels ranging from 40 to 140 keV. The signal-to-noise ratios of muscles at 6 different levels, glands (parotid, sublingual, submandibular, and thyroid), 30 tumors, and 17 metastatic lymph nodes were determined as measures of optimal image quality. Lesion attenuation and contrast-to-noise ratios (compared with those of muscle) were evaluated to assess lesion conspicuity.
   RESULTS: The optimal signal-to-noise ratio for all the tissues was at 65 keV (P < .0001). However, tumor attenuation (P < .0001), attenuation difference between tumor and muscles (P = .03), and lesion contrast-to-noise ratios (P < .0001) were highest at 40 keV.
   CONCLUSIONS: The optimal image signal-to-noise ratio is at 65 keV, but tumor conspicuity compared with that of muscle is greatest at 40 keV. Optimal evaluation of the neck may be best achieved by a multiparametric approach, with 65-keV virtual monochromatic images providing the best overall image quality and targeted use of 40-keV virtual monochromatic images for tumor evaluation.

TI Using Texture Analysis to Determine Human Papillomavirus Status of
   Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinomas on CT
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is increasing in prevalence and typically occurs in younger patients than human papillomavirus-negative squamous cell carcinoma. While imaging features of human papillomavirus-positive versus human papillomavirus-negative squamous cell carcinoma nodal metastases have been described, characteristics distinguishing human papillomavirus-positive from human papillomavirus-negative primary squamous cell carcinomas have not been well established. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the use of texture features to distinguish human papillomavirus-positive and human papillomavirus-negative primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, 40 patients with primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and known human papillomavirus status who underwent contrast-enhanced CT between December 2009 and October 2013 were included in this study. Segmentation of the primary lesion was manually performed with a semiautomated graphical-user interface. Following segmentation, an in-house-developed texture analysis program extracted 42 texture features from each segmented volume. A t test was used to evaluate differences in texture parameters between human papillomavirus-positive and human papillomavirus-negative squamous cell carcinomas.
   RESULTS: Of the 40 included patients, 29 had human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and 11 had human papillomavirus-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Significant differences were seen in the histogram parameters median (P = .006) and entropy (P = .016) and squamous cell carcinoma entropy (P = .043).
   CONCLUSIONS: There are statistically significant differences in some texture features between human papillomavirus-positive and human papillomavirus-negative oropharyngeal tumors. Texture analysis may be considered an adjunct to the evaluation of human papillomavirus status and characterization of squamous cell carcinoma.

AB Decision-making systems trained on structural magnetic resonance imaging data of subjects affected by the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls (CTRL) are becoming widespread prognostic tools for subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study compares the performances of three classification methods based on support vector machines (SVMs), using as initial sets of brain voxels (ie, features): (1) the segmented grey matter (GM); (2) regions of interest (ROIs) by voxel-wise t-test filtering; (3) parceled ROIs, according to prior knowledge. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) is applied in all cases to investigate whether feature reduction improves the classification accuracy. We analyzed more than 600 AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects, training the SVMs on the AD/CTRL dataset, and evaluating them on a trial MCI dataset. The classification performance, evaluated as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), reaches AUC = (88.9 +/- .5)% in 20-fold cross-validation on the AD/CTRL dataset, when the GM is classified as a whole. The highest discrimination accuracy between MCI converters and nonconverters is achieved when the SVM-RFE is applied to the whole GM: with AUC reaching (70.7 +/- .9)%, it outperforms both ROI-based approaches in predicting the AD conversion.

AB BACKGROUNDTo determine if extracranial venous structural and flow abnormalities exist in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
   METHODSMagnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the anatomy and function of major veins in the neck in 138 MS patients and 67 healthy controls (HC). Time-of-flight MR angiography (MRA) was used to assess stenosis while 2-dimensional phase-contrast flow quantification was used to assess flow at the C2/C3 and C5/C6 levels. Venous flow was normalized to the total arterial flow. The MS patients were divided into stenotic (ST) and nonstenotic (NST) groups based on MRA assessment, and each group was compared to the HC group in anatomy and flow.
   RESULTSThe MS group showed lower normalized internal jugular vein (IJV) blood flow (tIJV/tA) than the HC group (P < .001). In the MS group, 72 (52%) were classified as ST while 66 (48%) were NST. In the HC group, 11 (23%) were ST while 37 (77%) were NST. The ST-MS group had lower IJV flow than both HC and NST-MS groups.
   CONCLUSIONAfter categorizing the MS population into two groups based upon anatomical stenosis, as determined from an absolute quantification of IJV cross section, clear differences in IJV flow between the ST-MS and HC samples became evident. Despite the unknown etiology of MS, abnormal venous flow was noted in a distinct group of MS patients compared to HC.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the diagnostic accuracy of 3 T brain MRI is improved by region of interest (ROI) measures of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to differentiate between neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonism (AP) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in early stage parkinsonism.
   We performed a prospective observational cohort study of 60 patients presenting with early stage parkinsonism and initial uncertain diagnosis. At baseline, patients underwent a 3 T brain MRI including DTI. After clinical follow-up (mean 28.3 months), diagnoses could be made in 49 patients (30 PD and 19 AP). Conventional brain MRI was evaluated for regions of atrophy and signal intensity changes. Tract-based spatial statistics and ROI analyses of DTI were performed to analyze group differences in mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), and diagnostic thresholds were determined. Diagnostic accuracy of conventional brain MRI and DTI was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC).
   Significantly higher MD of the centrum semiovale, body corpus callosum, putamen, external capsule, midbrain, superior cerebellum, and superior cerebellar peduncles was found in AP. Significantly increased MD of the putamen was found in multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian form (MSA-P) and increased MD in the midbrain and superior cerebellar peduncles in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The diagnostic accuracy of brain MRI to identify AP as a group was not improved by ROI measures of MD, though the diagnostic accuracy to identify MSA-P was slightly increased (AUC 0.82 to 0.85).
   The diagnostic accuracy of brain MRI to identify AP as a group was not improved by the current analysis approach to DTI, though DTI measures could be of added value to identify AP subgroups.

TI SWI or T2*: Which MRI Sequence to Use in the Detection of Cerebral
   Microbleeds? The Karolinska Imaging Dementia Study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVALENCE; TOPOGRAPHY; DISEASE
AB The prevalence of cerebral microbleeds was evaluated in 246 patients using T2* and SWI. Microbleeds were detected in 21% by SWI vs. 17% by T2* imaging. SWI performed well with both thin and thick sections. Thus, SWI is better than T2* for this purpose and robust enough to permit comparison across studies.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds are thought to have potentially important clinical implications in dementia and stroke. However, the use of both T2* and SWI MR imaging sequences for microbleed detection has complicated the cross-comparison of study results. We aimed to determine the impact of microbleed sequences on microbleed detection and associated clinical parameters.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from our memory clinic (n = 246; 53% female; mean age, 62) prospectively underwent 3T MR imaging, with conventional thick-section T2*, thick-section SWI, and conventional thin-section SWI. Microbleeds were assessed separately on thick-section SWI, thin-section SWI, and T2* by 3 raters, with varying neuroradiologic experience. Clinical and radiologic parameters from the dementia investigation were analyzed in association with the number of microbleeds in negative binomial regression analyses.
   RESULTS: Prevalence and number of microbleeds were higher on thick-/thin-section SWI (20/21%) compared with T2*(17%). There was no difference in microbleed prevalence/number between thick- and thin-section SWI. Interrater agreement was excellent for all raters and sequences. Univariate comparisons of clinical parameters between patients with and without microbleeds yielded no difference across sequences. In the regression analysis, only minor differences in clinical associations with the number of microbleeds were noted across sequences.
   CONCLUSIONS: Due to the increased detection of microbleeds, we recommend SWI as the sequence of choice in microbleed detection. Microbleeds and their association with clinical parameters are robust to the effects of varying MR imaging sequences, suggesting that comparison of results across studies is possible, despite differing microbleed sequences.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate whether normal controls and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with and without planning deficits differ on white matter integrity.
   A total of 34 HIV-positive patients with planning deficits were compared with 13 HIV-positive patients without planning deficits and 19 gender-, age-, and education-matched control subjects. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed along 30 noncolinear directions in a 1.5-T scanner. For tract-based spatial statistics analysis, a white matter skeleton was created, and a permutation-based inference with 5000 permutations with a threshold of p < 0.05 was used to identify abnormalities in fractional anisotropy (FA). The median, radial, and axial diffusivities were also projected onto the mean FA skeleton.
   Compared with controls, HIV-positive patients with planning deficits had decreased FA in bilateral anterior thalamic radiations, bilateral inferior fronto-occiptal fasciculi, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral superior longitudinal fascicule, and bilateral uncinate fasciculi. Compared to HIV-positive patients without planning deficits, patients with planning deficits had decreased FA in bilateral anterior thalamic radiations, bilateral inferior fronto-occiptal fasciculi, genu of the corpus callosum, bilateral superior longitudinal fascicule, and right uncinate fascicule.
   DTI can detect extensive white matter abnormalities in the normal-appearing white matter of HIV-positive patients with planning deficits compared with controls and HIV-positive patients without planning deficits.

TI WEB Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: Feasibility, Complications, and
   1-Month Safety Results with the WEB DL and WEB SL/SLS in the French
   Observatory
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; FLOW-DISRUPTION; COILING; DEVICE; STENT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Safety analyses in the French Observatory have shown that treatment of intracranial aneurysms by using flow disruption with the Woven EndoBridge Device (WEB) is safe, with low morbidity and no mortality. The objective of this study was to analyze treatment feasibility, complications, and safety results in patients treated with the Woven EndoBridge Device Dual-Layer (WEB DL) and Woven EndoBridge Device Single-Layer/Single-Layer Sphere (WEB SL/SLS) in the French Observatory.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with bifurcation aneurysms were included in this prospective, multicenter good clinical practices study. A medical monitor independently analyzed procedural and clinical data. The study started with the WEB DL, and secondarily, the WEB SL/SLS was authorized in the study.
   RESULTS: Between November 2012 and January 2014, 10 French centers included 62 patients with 63 aneurysms. Thirty patients with 31 aneurysms were treated with the WEB DL, and 32 patients with 32 aneurysms, with the WEB SL/SLS. The percentage of anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with WEB SL/SLS was significantly higher (37.5%) compared with WEB DL (12.9%) (P = .04). The WEB SL/SLS was more frequently used in aneurysms of <10 mm than the WEB DL (respectively, 96.9% and 67.7%; P = .002). Morbidity was similar in both groups (WEB DL, 3.3%; WEB SL/SLS, 3.1%), and mortality was 0.0% in both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: This comparative study shows increased use of WEB treatment in ruptured, small, and anterior communicating artery aneurysms when using WEB SL/SLS. There was a trend toward fewer thromboembolic complications with the WEB SL/SLS. With both the WEB DL and WEB SL/SLS, the treatment was safe, with low morbidity and no mortality.

TI Anterior Choroidal Artery Patency and Clinical Follow-Up after Coverage
   with the Pipeline Embolization Device
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW-DISRUPTING DEVICE; ANEURYSMS; RECONSTRUCTION; DIVERTORS; BRANCHES;
   POROSITY; STENTS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endoluminal reconstruction with the Pipeline Embolization Device is an effective treatment option for select intracranial aneurysms. However, concerns for the patency of eloquent branch arteries covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device have been raised. We aimed to examine the patency of the anterior choroidal artery and clinical sequelae after ICA aneurysm treatment.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively analyzed all patients among our first 157 patients with ICA aneurysms treated by the Pipeline Embolization Device who required placement of at least 1 device across the ostium of the anterior choroidal artery. The primary outcome measure was angiographic patency of the anterior choroidal artery at last follow-up. Age, sex, type of aneurysm, neurologic examination data, number of Pipeline Embolization Devices used, relationship of the anterior choroidal artery to the aneurysm, and completeness of aneurysm occlusion on follow-up angiograms were also analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twenty-nine aneurysms requiring placement of at least 1 Pipeline Embolization Device (median = 1, range = 1-3) across the anterior choroidal artery ostium were identified. At angiographic follow-up (mean = 15.1 months; range = 12-39 months), the anterior choroidal artery remained patent, with antegrade flow in 28/29 aneurysms (96.5%), while 24/29 (82.7%) of the target aneurysms were angiographically occluded by 1-year follow-up angiography. Anterior choroidal artery occlusion, with retrograde reconstitution of the vessel, was noted in a single case. A significant correlation between the origin of the anterior choroidal artery from the aneurysm dome and failure of the aneurysms to occlude following treatment was found.
   CONCLUSIONS: After placement of 36 Pipeline Embolization Devices across 29 anterior choroidal arteries (median = 1 device, range = 1-3 devices), 1 of 29 anterior choroidal arteries was found occluded on angiographic follow-up. The vessel occlusion did not result in persistent clinical sequelae. Coverage of the anterior choroidal artery origin with the Pipeline Embolization Device, hence, may be considered reasonably safe when deemed necessary for aneurysm treatment.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEThe posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (pc-APECTS) applied to CT angiography source images (CTA-SI) predicts the functional outcome of patients in the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS). We assessed the diagnostic and prognostic impact of pc-ASPECTS applied to perfusion CT (CTP) in the BASICS registry population.
   METHODSWe applied pc-ASPECTS to CTA-SI and cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) parameter maps of BASICS patients with CTA and CTP studies performed. Hypoattenuation on CTA-SI, relative reduction in CBV or CBF, or relative increase in MTT were rated as abnormal.
   RESULTSCTA and CTP were available in 27/592 BASICS patients (4.6%). The proportion of patients with any perfusion abnormality was highest for MTT (93%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 76%-99%), compared with 78% (58%-91%) for CTA-SI and CBF, and 46% (27%-67%) for CBV (P < .001). All 3 patients with a CBV pc-ASPECTS < 8 compared to 6/23 patients with a CBV pc-ASPECTS 8 had died at 1 month (RR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.9-7.6).
   CONCLUSIONCTP was performed in a minority of the BASICS registry population. Perfusion disturbances in the posterior circulation were most pronounced on MTT parameter maps. CBV pc-ASPECTS < 8 may indicate patients with high case fatality.

AB BACKGROUNDThe hemodynamic force of wall shear stress (WSS) has demonstrated a critical role in atherogenesis.
   PURPOSETo study the effect of age and gender on mean WSS (MWSS) values in major cerebral arteries.
   METHODThirteen cerebral arterial location sites in 301 healthy (157 M, 144 F; mean 4715 years; range 18-84 years old) were studied. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography was used to obtain volume flow and diameter, and subsequently to calculate MWSS via the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.
   RESULTSMWSS decreased significantly with age in all vessels, declining from 9.5 to 5.7 dynes/cm(2) in the neck vessels and from 22.9 to 16.2 dynes/cm(2) in the intracranial vessels. MWSS is significantly higher in females than in males in all six neck vessels. The most significant drop in MWSS occurred between the age groups 48-57 and 58-67 (P < .05 for 12 vessels).
   CONCLUSIONThe overall decline in MWSS observed with age may be due to a decrease in flow. However, the marked drop in MWSS between the 48-57 and 58-67 age groups corresponded with an increase in diameter and systolic blood pressure rather than a significant drop in flow.

AB In this preliminary study, 7T imaging was capable of identifying not only intracranial wall thickening but different plaque components such as foamy macrophages and collagen. Signal heterogeneity was typical of advanced atherosclerotic disease.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several studies have attempted to characterize intracranial atherosclerotic plaques by using MR imaging sequences. However, dedicated validation of these sequences with histology has not yet been performed. The current study assessed the ability of ultra-high-resolution 7T MR imaging sequences with different image contrast weightings to image plaque components, by using histology as criterion standard.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five specimens of the circle of Wills were imaged at 7T with 0.11 x 0.11 mm in-plane-resolution proton attenuation-, T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted sequences (through-plane resolution, 0.11-1 mm). Tissue samples from 13 fiducial-marked locations (per specimen) on MR imaging underwent histologic processing and atherosclerotic plaque classification. Reconstructed MR images were matched with histologic sections at corresponding locations.
   RESULTS: Forty-four samples were available for subsequent evaluation of agreement or disagreement between plaque components and image contrast differences. Of samples, 52.3% (n = 23) showed no image contrast heterogeneity; this group comprised solely no lesions or early lesions. Of samples, 25.0% (n = 11, mostly advanced lesions) showed good correlation between the spatial organization of MR imaging heterogeneities and plaque components. Areas of foamy macrophages were generally seen as proton attenuation-, T2-, and T2*- hypointense areas, while areas of increased collagen content showed more ambiguous signal intensities. Five samples showed image-contrast heterogeneity without corresponding plaque components on histology; 5 other samples showed contrast heterogeneity based on intima-media artifacts.
   CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging at 7T has the image contrast capable of identifying both focal intracranial vessel wall thickening and distinguishing areas of different signal intensities spatially corresponding to plaque components within more advanced atherosclerotic plaques.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-diverter technology has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for intracranial aneurysm based on the concept of flow diversion allowing parent artery and collateral preservation and aneurysm healing. We investigated the patency of covered side branches and flow modification within the parent artery following placement of the Pipeline Embolization Device in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six aneurysms in 59 patients were treated with 96 Pipeline Embolization Devices. We retrospectively reviewed imaging and clinical results during the postoperative period at 6 and 12 months to assess flow modification through the parent artery and side branches. Reperfusion syndrome was assessed by MR imaging and clinical evaluation.
   RESULTS: Slow flow was observed in 13 of 68 (19.1%) side branches covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device. It was reported in all cases of anterior cerebral artery coverage, in 3/5 cases of M2-MCA coverage, and in 5/34 (14.7%) cases of ophthalmic artery coverage. One territorial infarction was observed in a case of M2-MCA coverage, without arterial occlusion. One case of deep Sylvian infarct was reported in a case of coverage of MCA perforators. Two ophthalmic arteries (5.9%) were occluded, and 11 side branches (16.2%) were narrowed at 12 months' follow-up; patients remained asymptomatic. Parent vessel flow modification was responsible for 2 cases (3.4%) of reperfusion syndrome. Overall permanent morbidity and mortality rates were 5.2% and 6.9%, respectively. We did not report any permanent deficit or death in case of slow flow observed within side branches.
   CONCLUSIONS: After Pipeline Embolization Device placement, reperfusion syndrome was observed in 3.4%, and territorial infarction, in 3.4%. Delayed occlusion of ophthalmic arteries and delayed narrowing of arteries covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device were observed in 5.9% and 16.2%, respectively. No permanent morbidity or death was related to side branch coverage at midterm follow-up.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEAmygdala enlargement (AE) has been reported as an epileptogenic focus in subtypes of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, morphological, and pathological characteristics of AE.
   METHODSWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and imaging findings of 23 TLE patients with ipsilateral AE. We performed morphological MR analyses using FreeSurfer and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in 14 of the 23 patients and in 20 controls whose images were obtained by a 3.0-Tesla MRI. A pathological study was also performed in 2 patients who underwent operations.
   RESULTSAll patients became seizure free or shSowed dramatic improvement by medical therapy except for two. They received operations and their pathology revealed that both patients had cortical dysplasia in from the amygdala to the ipsilateral temporal pole. The FreeSurfer analysis showed a significant difference in the amygdala volumes between the affected and nonaffected sides. VBM revealed significant increases of gray matter volumes of the temporal pole on the side of AE in seven of the 14 patients with AE (50%).
   CONCLUSIONSCortical dysplasia may be one of the pathological diagnoses in AE, and in some patients it may extend to the temporal pole.

AB PURPOSEWe tested the validity of a freely available segmentation pipeline to measure compartmental brain volumes from 3T MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Our primary focus was methodological to explore the effect of segmentation corrections on the clinical relevance of the output metrics.
   METHODSThree-dimensional T1-weighted images were acquired to compare 61 MS patients to 30 age- and gender-matched normal controls (NC). We also tested the within patient MRI relationship to disability (eg, expanded disability status scale [EDSS] score) and cognition. Statistical parametric mapping v. 8 (SPM8)-derived gray matter (GMF), white matter (WMF), and total brain parenchyma fractions (BPF) were derived before and after correcting errors from T1 hypointense MS lesions and/or ineffective deep GM contouring.
   RESULTSMS patients had lower GMF and BPF as compared to NC (P<.05). Cognitively impaired patients had lower BPF than cognitively preserved patients (P<.05). BPF was related to EDSS; BPF and GMF were related to disease duration (all P<.05). Errors caused bias in GMFs and WMFs but had no discernable influence on BPFs or any MRI-clinical associations.
   CONCLUSIONSWe report the validity of a segmentation pipeline for the detection of MS-related brain atrophy with 3T MRI. Longitudinal studies are warranted to extend these results.

AB BACKGROUNDPosterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a rare neurodegenerative syndrome with visuospatial deficits. PET studies have identified hypometabolism of the occipital cortex in PCA. There is, however, a huge overlap in clinical presentation and involvement of the occipital cortex between PCA, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Syndrome-specific patterns of metabolism have not yet been demonstrated that allow for a reliable differentiation with [F-18]-FDG-PET.
   METHODSA total of 33 dementia patients (PCA n = 6, DLB n = 12, AD n = 15) who underwent [F-18]-FDG-PET imaging and a neuropsychological examination were retrospectively analyzed. Group comparisons of regional cerebral glucose metabolism were calculated with statistical parametric mapping. Extracted clusters were used to evaluate discrimination accuracy by logistic regression.
   RESULTSPCA patients showed a syndrome-specific area of hypometabolism in the right lateral temporooccipital cortex. DLB patients showed specific hypometabolism predominantly in the left occipital cortex. Logistic regression based on these two regions correctly separated patients with a sensitivity/specificity of 83/93% for PCA, 75/86% for DLB and 67/78% for AD. Overall accuracy was 73%.
   CONCLUSION[F-18]-FDG-PET could reveal syndrome-specific patterns of glucose metabolism in PCA and DLB. Accurate group discrimination in the differential diagnosis of dementia with visuospatial impairment is feasible.

AB Studies with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis have produced conflicting information about the involvement of the cerebellar hemispheres in Parkinson's disease (PD). We, thus, used a new approach for the analysis of DTI parameters in order to ascertain the involvement of the cerebellum in PD.
   We performed a fiber tract-based analysis of cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar hemispheres in 16 healthy subjects and in 16 PD patients with more than 5 years duration of disease, using a 3T MRI scanner and a constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) approach for tractographic reconstructions. In addition, we performed statistical analysis of DTI parameters and fractional anisotropy (FA) XYZ direction samplings.
   We found a statistically significant decrement of FA values in PD patients compared to controls (p < 0.05). In addition, extrapolating and analyzing FA XYZ direction samplings for each patient and each control, we found that this result was due to a stronger decrement of FA values along the Y axis (antero-posterior direction) (p < 0.01); FA changes along X and Z axes were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). We confirmed also no statistically significant differences of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for cerebellar peduncles in PD patients compared to healthy controls.
   The DTI-based cerebellar abnormalities in PD could constitute an advance in the knowledge of this disease. We demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of FA in cerebellar hemispheres of PD patients compared to healthy controls. Our work also demonstrated that the use of more sophisticated approaches in the DTI parameter analysis could potentially have a clinical relevance.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship between reperfusion and clinical outcome is time-dependent, and the effect of reperfusion on outcome can vary on the basis of the extent of collateral flow. We aimed to identify the impact of time-to-reperfusion on outcome relative to baseline angiographic collateral grade in patients successfully treated with endovascular revascularization for acute large-vessel anterior circulation stroke.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred seven patients were selected for analysis from our prospectively maintained registry. Inclusion criteria were M1 MCA +/- ICA occlusions, onset-to-puncture time within 8 hours, and successful endovascular reperfusion. Baseline angiographic collateral grades were independently evaluated and dichotomized into poor (0-1) versus good (2-4). Multivariable analyses were performed to identify the effect of collateral-flow adequacy on favorable outcome on the basis of onset-to-reperfusion time and puncture-to-reperfusion time.
   RESULTS: In the poor collateral group, the odds of favorable outcome significantly dropped for patients with onset-to-reperfusion time of >300 minutes or puncture-to-reperfus ion time of >60 minutes (onset-to-puncture time: <= 300, 59% versus >300, 32%; OR, 0.24; P =.011; puncture-to-reperfusion time: m.60, 73% versus >60,32%: OR, 0.21,P = .011), whereas the probability of favorable outcome in the good collateral group was not significantly influenced by onset-to-reperfusion time or punctur e-to-reperfusion time. In the subgroup lesion-volume growth analysis by using DWI, the effect of puncture-to-reperfusion time of >60 minutes was significantly greater compared with the effect of puncture-to-reperfusion time of <.60 minutes in the poor collateral group (beta = 41.6 cm(3), P = .001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Time-to-reperfusion including onset-to-reperfusion time and puncture-to-reperfusion time in patients with poor collaterals is an important limiting factor for favorable outcome in a time-dependent fashion. Future trials may benefit from a noninvasive imaging technique to detect poor collaterals along with a strategy for rapid reperfusion.

TI The Computational Fluid Dynamics Rupture Challenge 2013-Phase I:
   Prediction of Rupture Status in Intracranial Aneurysms
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; HEMODYNAMICS; ASSOCIATION;
   MODELS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rupture risk assessment for intracranial aneurysms remains challenging, and risk factors, including wall shear stress, are discussed controversially. The primary purpose of the presented challenge was to determine how consistently aneurysm rupture status and rupture site could be identified on the basis of computational fluid dynamics.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two geometrically similar MCA aneurysms were selected, 1 ruptured, 1 unruptured. Participating computational fluid dynamics groups were blinded as to which case was ruptured. Participants were provided with digitally segmented lumen geometries and, for this phase of the challenge, were free to choose their own flow rates, blood rheologies, and so forth. Participants were asked to report which case had ruptured and the likely site of rupture. In parallel, lumen geometries were provided to a group of neurosurgeons for their predictions of rupture status and site.
   RESULTS: Of 26 participating computational fluid dynamics groups, 21 (81%) correctly identified the ruptured case. Although the known rupture site was associated with low and oscillatory wall shear stress, most groups identified other sites, some of which also experienced low and oscillatory shear. Of the 43 participating neurosurgeons, 39 (91%) identified the ruptured case. None correctly identified the rupture site.
   CONCLUSIONS: Geometric or hemodynamic considerations favor identification of rupture status; however, retrospective identification of the rupture site remains a challenge for both engineers and clinicians. A more precise understanding of the hemodynamic factors involved in aneurysm wall pathology is likely required for computational fluid dynamics to add value to current clinical decision-making regarding rupture risk.

TI Silk Flow-Diverter Stent for the Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: A
   Series of 58 Patients with Emphasis on Long-Term Results
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; FOLLOW-UP; COMPLICATIONS; COILING; TRIAL
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Silk flow-diverter stent is increasingly used to treat complex intracranial aneurysms including wide-neck, fusiform aneurysms. Sparse data are available concerning long-term results of this technique. We report our 5-year experience with Silk stent treatment of intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified all patients treated by the Silk stent in 2 institutions. Clinical charts, procedural data, and angiographic results were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Between July 2009 and May 2014, we identified 58 patients with 70 intracranial aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was successful in 93% of patients with 32 treated with the first-generation Silk stent and 26 with the new Silk+ stent. Mean follow-up in 47 patients was 22 months. Despite an 11% delayed complication rate, overall permanent neurologic morbidity was 5.5%. All complications were seen with the first-generation Silk stent. There was no procedure-related mortality. Long-term anatomic results showed 73% with complete occlusion, 16% with neck remnants, and 11% with incomplete occlusion. No recanalization or retreatment was performed. The midterm intrastent stenosis rate was 57%, of which 60% improved or disappeared, 28% were stable, and 12% led to vessel occlusion. Seventy-four percent of stenosis and all vessel occlusions occurred with the first-generation Silk stent.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms with the Silk stent is an effective therapeutic option. Despite a high rate of delayed complications with the first-generation stents, the current Silk+ stent appears safer. This treatment achieves a high rate of adequate and stable occlusion at long-term follow-up.

TI Comparison of 3T and 7T Susceptibility-Weighted Angiography of the
   Substantia Nigra in Diagnosing Parkinson Disease

LA English
DT Article

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Standard neuroimaging fails in defining the anatomy of the substantia nigra and has a marginal role in the diagnosis of Parkinson disease. Recently 7T MR target imaging of the substantia nigra has been useful in diagnosing Parkinson disease. We performed a comparative study to evaluate whether susceptibility-weighted angiography can diagnose Parkinson disease with a 3T scanner.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with Parkinson disease and 13 healthy subjects underwent MR imaging examination at 3T and 7T by using susceptibility-weighted angiography. Two expert blinded observers and 1 neuroradiology fellow evaluated the 3T and 7T images of the sample to identify substantia nigra abnormalities indicative of Parkinson disease. Diagnostic accuracy and intra-and interobserver agreement were calculated separately for 3T and 7T acquisitions.
   RESULTS: Susceptibility-weighted angiography 7T MR imaging can diagnose Parkinson disease with a mean sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 100%, and diagnostic accuracy of 96%. 3T MR imaging diagnosed Parkinson disease with a mean sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 94%, and diagnostic accuracy of 86%. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was excellent at 7T. At 3T, intraobserver agreement was excellent for experts, and interobserver agreement ranged between good and excellent. The less expert reader obtained a diagnostic accuracy of 89% at 3T.
   CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility-weighted angiography images obtained at 3T and 7T differentiate controls from patients with Parkinson disease with a higher diagnostic accuracy at 7T. The capability of 3T in diagnosing Parkinson disease might encourage its use in clinical practice. The use of the more accurate 7T should be supported by a dedicated cost-effectiveness study.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSETo investigate the frequency and characteristics of developmental venous anomaly (DVA)-associated perfusion abnormalities on arterial spin labeling (ASL) and bolus perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and discuss their potential causes.
   METHODSWe reviewed brain MR reports to identify all DVAs reported on studies performed between 2009 and 2012. DVA location and findings on PWI and/or ASL imaging were assessed by visual inspection. Sizes of DVAs were categorized as small (<15 mm), medium (15-25 mm), and large (>25 mm). For ASL, signal in the DVA, surrounding parenchyma, or associated draining vein was recorded. For PWI, changes on hemodynamic maps (cerebral blood volume [CBV], cerebral blood flow [CBF], mean transit time [MTT], and normalized time-to-peak of the residue function [Tmax]) were evaluated. Coexisting vascular malformations in association with DVAs were also identified.
   RESULTSSix hundred and fifty-two DVAs were identified in 632 subjects. Of these, 121 underwent both perfusion modalities, 15 only PWI, and 127 only ASL. ASL abnormalities were seen in 21/248 (8%), including signal in a draining vein (2/21, 10%), in the DVA (11/21, 52%), and in the parenchyma (8/21, 38%). On PWI, the majority of DVAs demonstrated abnormalities (108/136, 79%), typically increased CBF, CBV, MTT, and Tmax. There was no association between DVA size and presence of ASL signal (P = .836). Borderline statistical significance was found between DVA size and presence of PWI abnormality (P = .046). No relationship was found between the presence of a coexisting vascular malformation and presence of ASL (P = .468) or PWI abnormality (P = .745).
   CONCLUSIONSPerfusion changes with DVAs are common on PWI but uncommon on ASL. PWI findings are expected based on the anatomy and physiology of DVAs and are accentuated by gradient echo acquisition. DVAs with intrinsic ASL signal or signal in draining veins may be associated with arteriovenous shunting (transitional lesions).

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEHypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is an uncommon type of transneuronal degeneration. Case reports and case series described in the literature provide a foundation of our current knowledge of HOD. These reports have described HOD most frequently to be unilateral and occurring in association with lesions in the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway. Our purpose was to evaluate the rate of bilateral versus unilateral HOD in a large case series.
   METHODSA retrospective review was performed to identify patients in which the phrase hypertrophic olivary degeneration occurred in the radiology report. A diagnosis of HOD was confirmed on imaging if there was focal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images confined to either or both inferior olivary nuclei.
   RESULTSA total of 102 patients had findings consistent with HOD. Of these, 76% had findings bilaterally. In 44%, a lesion could not be identified to explain HOD. Bilateral HOD was common in both lesional and nonlesional group, though more common in the nonlesional group.
   CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates that HOD is frequently bilateral. In slightly over 50% of patients with HOD, a lesion can be identified. In just under 50% patients with HOD, a lesion could not be identified and in these cases HOD was present bilaterally in the majority.

AB Carotid artery dissection is an important cause of ischemic stroke in all age groups, particularly in young patients. The purpose of this work was to assess whether there is an association between the presence of an internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD) and the arterial tortuosity.
   This study considered 124 patients (72 males and 52 females; median age 57 years) with CT/MR diagnosis of ICAD of the internal carotid artery were considered in this multi-centric retrospective study. The arterial tortuosity was evaluated and, when present, was categorized as elongation, kinking, or coiling. For each patient, both the right and left sides were considered for a total number of 248 arteries in order to have the same number of cases and controls. Fisher's exact test was applied to test the association between elongation, kinking, coiling, dissection, and the side affected by CAD.
   Fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant association between the ICAD and kinking (p = 0.0089) and coiling (p = 0.0251) whereas no statistically significant difference was found with arterial vessel elongation (p = 0.444). ICAD was more often seen on the left side compared to the right (p = 0.0001). These results were confirmed using both carotid arteries of the same patient as dependent parameter with p = 0.0012, 0.0129, and 0.3323 for kinking, coiling, and elongation, respectively.
   The presence of kinking and coiling is associated with ICAD.

TI Diffusion-Weighted Imaging of the Head and Neck in Healthy Subjects:
   Reproducibility of ADC Values in Different MRI Systems and Repeat
   Sessions
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; COEFFICIENT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DWI is typically performed with EPI sequences in single-center studies. The purpose of this study. was to determine the reproducibility of ADC values in the head and neck region in healthy subjects. In addition, the reproducibility of ADC values in different tissues was assessed to identify the most suitable reference tissue.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 7 healthy subjects, with EPI and TSE sequences, on 5 MR imaging systems at 3 time points in 2 institutions. ADC maps of EPI (with 2 b-values and 6 b-values) and TSE sequences were compared. Mean ADC values for different tissues (submandibular gland, sternocleidomastoid muscle, spinal cord, subdigastric lymph node, and tonsil) were used to evaluate intra- and intersubject, intersystem, and intersequence variability by using a linear mixed model.
   RESULTS: On 97% of images, a region of interest could be placed on the spinal cord, compared with 87% in the tonsil. ADC values derived from EPI-DWI with 2 b-values and calculated EPI-DWI with 2 b-values extracted from EPI-DWI with 6 b-values did not differ significantly. The standard error of ADC measurement was the smallest for the tonsil and spinal cord (standard error of measurement = 151.2 X 10(-6) mm/s(2) and 190.1 X 10(-6) mm/s(2), respectively). The intersystem difference for mean ADC values and the influence of the MR imaging system on ADC values among the subjects were statistically significant (P < .001). The mean difference among examinations was negligible (ie, <10 X 10(-6) mm/s(2)).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the spinal cord was the most appropriate reference tissue and EPI-DWI with 6 b-values was the most reproducible sequence. ADC values were more precise if subjects were measured on the same MR imaging system and with the same sequence. ADC values differed significantly between MR imaging systems and sequences.

   SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Polymicrogyria is a malformation of cortical development that is often identified in children with epilepsy or delayed development. We investigated in vivo the potential of 7T imaging in characterizing polymicrogyria to determine whether additional features could be identified.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten adult patients with polymicrogyria previously diagnosed by using 3T MR imaging underwent additional imaging at 7T. We assessed polymicrogyria according to topographic pattern, extent, symmetry, and morphology. Additional imaging sequences at 7T included 3D T2* susceptibility-weighted angiography and 2D tissue border enhancement FSE inversion recovery. Minimum intensity projections were used to assess the potential of the susceptibility-weighted angiography sequence for depiction of cerebral veins.
   RESULTS: At 7T, we observed perisylvian polymicrogyria that was bilateral in 6 patients, unilateral in 3, and diffuse in 1. Four of the 6 bilateral abnormalities had been considered unilateral at 3T. While 3T imaging revealed 2 morphologic categories (coarse, delicate), 7T susceptibility-weighted angiography images disclosed a uniform ribbonlike pattern. Susceptibility-weighted angiography revealed numerous dilated superficial veins in all polymicrogyric areas. Tissue border enhancement imaging depicted a hypointense line corresponding to the gray-white interface, providing a high definition of the borders and, thereby, improving detection of the polymicrogyric cortex.
   CONCLUSIONS: 7T imaging reveals more anatomic details of polymicrogyria compared with 3T conventional sequences, with potential implications for diagnosis, genetic studies, and surgical treatment of associated epilepsy. Abnormalities of cortical veins may suggest a role for vascular dysgenesis in pathogenesis.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment of wide-neck, complex, and distally located cerebral aneurysms is a challenging issue. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of dual stent placement by using a low-profile stent system (LEO Baby) for the treatment of challenging distal intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients in whom at least 1 LEO Baby stent was used in the context of dual stent placement for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Patients who were treated with dual stent-assisted coil embolization and telescopic implantation of LEO Baby stents were included in the study. Clinical and angiographic findings, procedural data, and follow-up are reported.
   RESULTS: Twelve patients were included in this study. Three patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage in the subacute-chronic phase, and the remaining patients had unruptured aneurysms. Nine patients were treated by using the dual stent-assisted coiling method. X- (nonintersecting), Y- (intersecting and reversible), T-, and parallel-stent configurations were performed for the dual stent-assisted coiling procedures. Three patients were treated by using telescopic stent placement for a flow diverter like effect. The procedures were successful in all cases. Technical complications without a significant clinical adverse event developed in 2 patients. The 3- and 6-month control MRAs and DSAs demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysms in all patients except 1. All patients had good clinical outcomes on follow-up (mRS <= 1).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this small study showed the feasibility of dual stent placement by using low-profile LEO Baby stents to treat distally located complex intracranial aneurysms.

TI Visual Outcomes with Flow-Diverter Stents Covering the Ophthalmic Artery

ID PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR
   TREATMENT; RECONSTRUCTION; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-diverting stents can be-used to treat intracranial aneurysms that-are not amenable to treatment with coils. We analyzed ophthalmic consequences due to coverage of the origin of the ophthalmic artery by flow-diverting stents for the treatment of internal carotid artery aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2009 to April 2013, the clinical and angiographic outcomes of all 28 patients treated for aneurysms with flow-diverting stents covering the origin of the ophthalmic artery were prospectively collected. The origin of the ophthalmic artery in relation to the target aneurysm was classified by using a 4-type classification. A complete ophthalmic examination was performed by a single ophthalmologist 48 hours before and 1 week after covering the ophthalmic artery.
   RESULTS: Ophthalmic artery patency was normal at the end of endovascular treatment in 24/28 cases (85.7%). With extensive ophthalmic examinations, 11 patients (39.3%) showed new ophthalmic complications. Patients with the ophthalmic artery originating from the aneurysm sac were at high risk for retinal emboli (4/5, 80%). Patients with the ophthalmic artery originating from the inner curve of the carotid siphon were at high risk for optic nerve ischemic atrophy (3/4, 75%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study shows that covering the ophthalmic artery with a flow-diverting stent is not without potential complications. Ophthalmic complications can occur but are often not diagnosed. The anatomic disposition of the ophthalmic artery in relation to the carotid siphon and aneurysm should be clearly understood because some configurations have a higher risk. When not required, covering of the ophthalmic artery by flow-diverting stents should be avoided.

AB Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption has long been held to predominantly entail drainage into the venous outflow system via the intracranial arachnoid granulations. Newer data suggest pathways involving spinal arachnoid granulations and lymphatic channels may also make substantial contributions to CSF outflow.
   The putative major CSF outflow pathways and their proportionate contribution to CSF absorption were reviewed in this article.
   CSF is absorbed and drained in bulk not just through cerebral arachnoid granulations (CAG) but also through spinal arachnoid granulations (SAG) and a lymphatic pathway involving egress through cranial and spinal nerve sheaths. The proportions of CSF that efflux through each of these major pathways have yet to be determined with any certainty in humans, though existing evidence (the majority of which is derived from animal studies) suggests that lymphatic pathways may account for up to 50 % of CSF outflow-presumably leaving the CAG and SAG to process the balance.
   Knowledge of the CSF pathways holds implications for our ability to understand, prognose, and even treat diseases related to CSF circulation and so is a matter of considerable relevance to neuroradiology and neurology.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). If mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event contributing to PD development, then noninvasive techniques that detect disturbed energy metabolism in vivo might be useful tools for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that proton (H-1) and phosphorus (P-31) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures of brain metabolites are able to differentiate between individuals with early PD and healthy volunteers (HVs).
   METHODS
   During this cross-sectional study including 20 subjects with early PD and 15 age-matched HV, ventricular lactate (anaerobic glycolysis); and regional levels of N-acetylaspartate (neuronal integrity); choline (membrane turnover); creatine (energy metabolism); ATP and other phosphate-containing compounds (oxidative phosphorylation) were determined using brain H-1 and P-31 MRS.
   RESULTS
   No metabolic abnormalities were detectable in early-stage PD patients. Metabolite concentrations were not related to age, disease duration, or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores.
   DISCUSSION
   In early PD, neither H-1 nor P-31 MRS were able to detect metabolic abnormalities, a finding that is in contrast to published data in more advanced PD cohorts. MRS under dynamic conditions might uncover latent energy deficits in early PD, thus warranting future study.

AB Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS) and en coup de sabre (ECS) are variants of morphea. Although numerous findings on central nervous system (CNS) imaging of PRS and ECS have been reported, the spectrum and frequency of CNS imaging findings and relation to cutaneous and neurologic abnormalities have not been fully characterized.
   We retrospectively reviewed patients younger than 50 years at our institution over a 16-year interval who had clinical diagnosis of PRS and ECS by a skin or facial subspecialist. Two neuroradiologists evaluated available imaging and characterized CNS imaging findings.
   Eighty-eight patients with PRS or ECS were identified (62 women [70.4 %]; mean age 28.8 years). Of the 43 patients with CNS imaging, 19 (44 %) had abnormal findings. The only finding in 1 of these 19 patients was lateral ventricle asymmetry; of the other 18, findings were bilateral in 11 (61 %), ipsilateral to the side of facial involvement in 6 (33 %), and contralateral in 1 (6 %). Sixteen patients had serial imaging examinations over an average of 632 days; 13 (81 %) had stable imaging findings, and 3 (19 %) had change over time. Of six patients with progressive cutaneous findings, five (83 %) had stable imaging findings over time. Among the 23 patients with clinical neurologic abnormality and imaging, 12 (52 %) had abnormal imaging findings. All seven patients with seizures (100 %) had abnormal imaging studies.
   In PRS and ECS, imaging findings often are bilateral and often do not progress, regardless of cutaneous disease activity. Findings are inconsistently associated with clinical abnormalities.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Head and neck cancer is common, and understanding the prognosis is an important part of patient management. In addition to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis staging system, tumor biomarkers are becoming more useful in understanding prognosis and directing treatment. We assessed whether MR imaging texture analysis would correctly classify oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma according to p53 status.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 16 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma was prospectively evaluated by using standard clinical, histopathologic, and imaging techniques. Tumors were stained for p53 and scored by an anatomic pathologist. Regions of interest on MR imaging were selected by a neuroradiologist and then analyzed by using our 2D fast time-frequency transform tool. The quantified textures were assessed by using the subset-size forward-selection algorithm in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. Features found to be significant were used to create a statistical model to predict p53 status. The model was tested by using a Bayesian network classifier with 10-fold stratified cross-validation.
   RESULTS: Feature selection identified 7 significant texture variables that were used in a predictive model. The resulting model predicted p53 status with 81.3% accuracy (P < .05). Cross-validation showed a moderate level of agreement (kappa = 0.625).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that MR imaging texture analysis correctly predicts p53 status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with similar to 80% accuracy. As our knowledge of and dependence on tumor biomarkers expand, MR imaging texture analysis warrants further study in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and other head and neck tumors.

AB BACKGROUND
   Previous studies have demonstrated that cerebral dural sinus stenosis (DSS) may be a potential patho-physiological cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Endovascular therapy for DSS is emerging as a potential alternative to treat IIH. Here, we present the results of our case series.
   METHOD
   We prospectively collected angiographic and manometric data on patients that underwent angioplasty/stenting for IIH. All patients had failed maximal medical therapy (MMT) and had confirmed sinus stenosis. Demographic, clinical and radiological presentation, and outcomes were collected retrospectively.
   RESULTS
   A total of 18 patients underwent 25 procedures. Demographics revealed a mean age of 30 (range 15-59), 83% (15/18) were female, 72% (13/18) were white, and mean body mass index of 36 (range 23-59.2). All patients presented with classic IIH. Symptom improvement or resolution was reported in 94% (17/18) of patients. All patients had resolution and/or stabilization/improvement of their papilledema. Headaches related to increased pressure improved in 56% (10/18). Re-stenosis and retreatment occurred in 33% (6/18). No procedural related complications were reported.
   CONCLUSION
   Dural sinus angioplasty and stenting is relatively safe, feasible, and clinically efficacious for patients with symptomatic sinus stenosis who have failed standard therapy. The long-term durability of patency and clinical improvement remains unknown.

AB Treatment with the humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab in glioblastoma patients suppresses contrast enhancement via the reduction of vascular permeability, which does not necessarily indicate real reduction of tumor cell mass. Therefore, other imaging criteria are needed to recognize tumor growth under bevacizumab more reliably. It is still unknown, whether quantitative T1 mapping is useful to monitor the effects of anti-angiogenic therapy or to indicate a tumor progression earlier and more reliable compared to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. This raised the question whether quantitative T1 mapping is more suitable to monitor treatment effects of bevacizumab.
   Conventional and quantitative MRI was performed on six consecutive patients with recurrent glioblastoma before treatment with bevacizumab and every 8 weeks thereafter until further tumor progression. Quantitative T1 maps before and after intravenous application of contrast agent and quantitative T2 maps were performed to calculate serial differential maps and subtraction maps from one time point, subtracting contrast-enhanced T1 maps from non-contrast T1 maps.
   In five illustrative cases, tumor progression was documented earlier in differential T1 relaxation time (DiffT1) and T2 relaxation time (DiffT2) maps before changes in the conventional MRI studies were obvious. Four patients showed previous prolongation of T1 relaxation time in the DiffT1 maps, suggesting tumor progression, and subtraction maps revealed faint contrast enhancement matching with the areas of T1 prolongation.
   Our results emphasize that quantitative relaxation time mapping could be a promising method for tumor monitoring in glioblastoma patients under anti-angiogenic therapy. Quantitative T1 mapping seems to detect enhancing tumor earlier than conventional contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images.

AB Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used in the pre-operative assessment of brain tumours. The aim of this prospective study was to identify the perfusion parameters from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion imaging that could best discriminate between grade II and III gliomas.
   MRI (3 T) including morphological ((T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1-weighted (T1W)+Gd)) and perfusion (DCE and DSC) sequences was performed in 39 patients with newly diagnosed suspected low-grade glioma after written informed consent in this review board-approved study. Regions of interests (ROIs) in tumour area were delineated on FLAIR images co-registered to DCE and DSC, respectively, in 25 patients with histopathological grade II (n = 18) and III (n = 7) gliomas. Statistical analysis of differences between grade II and grade III gliomas in histogram perfusion parameters was performed, and the areas under the curves (AUC) from the ROC analyses were evaluated.
   In DCE, the skewness of transfer constant (k (trans)) was found superior for differentiating grade II from grade III in all gliomas (AUC 0.76). In DSC, the standard deviation of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was found superior for differentiating grade II from grade III gliomas (AUC 0.80).
   Histogram parameters from k (trans) (DCE) and rCBF (DSC) could most efficiently discriminate between grade II and grade III gliomas.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pulsed arterial spin-labeling, DTI, and MR spectroscopy provide useful data for tumor evaluation. We evaluated multiple parameters by using these pulse sequences and the Ki-67 labeling index in newly diagnosed supratentorial gliomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 32 patients, with grade II (3 each of diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma), grade III (3 anaplastic astrocytomas, 4 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and 1 anaplastic oligoastrocytoma), and grade IV (14 glioblastomas and 1 glioblastoma with an oligodendroglioma component) cases underwent pulsed arterial spin-labeling, DTI, and MR spectroscopy studies by using 3T MR imaging. The following variables were used to compare the tumors: relative cerebral blood flow, fractional anisotropy; ADC tumor/normal ratios; and the Cho/Cr, NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and lactate/Cr ratios. A logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to assess parameters with a high sensitivity and specificity to identify the threshold values for separate grading. We compared the Ki-67 index with various MR imaging parameters in tumor specimens.
   RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed between the Ki-67 index and the mean, maximum, and minimum ADC, Cho/Cr, and lactate/Cr ratios. The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the combination of the minimum ADC and Cho/Cr ratios could differentiate low-grade and high-grade gliomas, with a sensitivity and specificity of 87.0% and 88.9%, respectively. The mean and maximum relative cerebral blood flow ratios were used to classify glioblastomas from other-grade astrocytomas, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.9% and 83.3%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that pulsed arterial spin-labeling, DTI, and MR spectroscopy are useful for predicting glioma grade. Additionally, the parameters obtained on DTI and MR spectroscopy closely correlated with the proliferative potential of gliomas.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent-assisted coiling with two stents has been described in some series for the treatment of complex and wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. Our aim was to report our experience of a stent-assisted coiling technique with double stents in "Y" and "X" configurations, with emphasis on safety, feasibility, and efficacy.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients for whom the strategic therapeutic option was the stent-assisted coiling technique in a Y or X configuration for neck scaffolding from June 2006 to June 2013 were retrospectively analyzed.
   RESULTS: One hundred five aneurysms in 97 patients were treated during 100 consecutive procedures. There were 54.2% (57/105) MCA, 28.6% (30/105) anterior communicating artery, 16.2% (17/105) basilar tip, and 1.0% (1/105) ICA termination aneurysms. A Y stent placement was used to treat 87 aneurysms in 85 procedures; an X stent placement was used to treat 7 aneurysms in 6 procedures, while 9 procedures failed for 11 aneurysms. There were 10.0% (10/100) procedure-related permanent neurologic deficits and 1.0% (1/100) death. The immediate angiographic controls showed a complete occlusion in 47.6% (50/105) of the aneurysms and a partial (neck or sac remnant) occlusion in 52.4% (55/105). To date, 81.0% (85/105) of the aneurysms have been followed up (mean, 17 months) with angiography, disclosing a recanalization in 5.9% (5/85) and an improvement in 42.4% (36/85). At discharge and follow-up, the mRS score was 0 in 83.5% (81/97) of patients, 1 in 4.1% (4/97), 2 in 3.1% (3/97), 3 in 4.1% (4/97), 4 in 3.1% (3/97), and 6 in 2.1% (2/97).
   CONCLUSIONS: Y and X stent-assisted coiling of complex and wide-neck intracranial bifurcation aneurysms is an effective technique.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging and PET/CT are integrated in the work-up of head and neck cancer patients. The hybrid imaging technology F-18-FDG-PET/MR imaging combining morphological and functional information might be attractive in this patient population. The aim of the study was to compare whole-body F-18-FDG-PET/MR imaging and F-18-FDG-PET/CT in patients with head and neck cancer, both qualitatively in terms of lymph node and distant metastases detection and quantitatively in terms of standardized uptake values measured in F-18-FDG-avid lesions.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with head and neck cancer underwent both whole-body PET/CT and PET/MR imaging after a single injection of F-18-FDG. Two groups of readers counted the number of lesions on PET/CT and PET/MR imaging scans. A consensus reading was performed in those cases in which the groups disagreed. Quantitative standardized uptake value measurements were performed by placing spheric ROIs over the lesions in 3 different planes. Weighted and unweighted K statistics, correlation analysis, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test were used for statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: K statistics for the number of head and neck lesion lesions counted (pooled across regions) revealed interreader agreement between groups land 2 of 0.47 and 0.56, respectively. Intrareader agreement was 0.67 and 0.63. The consensus reading provided an intrareader agreement of 0.63. For the presence or absence of metastasis, interreader agreement was 0.85 and 0.70. The consensus reading provided an intrareader agreement of 0.72. The correlations between the maximum standardized uptake value in F-18-FDG-PET/MR imaging and F-18-FDG-PET/CT for primary tumors and lymph node and metastatic lesions were very high (Spearman r = 1.00, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with head and neck cancer, F-18-FDG-PET/MR imaging and F-18-FDG-PET/CT provide comparable results in the detection of lymph node and distant metastases. Standardized uptake values derived from F-18-FDG-PET/MR imaging can be used reliably in this patient population.

TI Preoperative Embolization of Intracranial Meningiomas: Efficacy,

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative embolization for intracranial meningiomas offers potential advantages for safer and more effective surgery. However, this treatment strategy has not been examined in a large comparative series. The purpose of this study was to review our experience using preoperative embolization to understand the efficacy, technical considerations and complications of this technique.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing intracranial meningionna resection at our institution (March 2001 to December 2012). Comparisons were made between ennbolized and nonernbolized patients, including patient and tumor characteristics, embolization method, operative blood loss, complications, and extent of resection. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors predictive of operative blood loss and extent of resection.
   RESULTS: Preoperatively, 224 patients were referred for embolization, of which 177 received embolization. No complications were seen in 97.1%. There were no significant differences in operative duration, extent of resection, or complications. Estimated blood loss was higher in the embolized group (410 versus 315 mL, P =.0074), but history of embolization was not a predictor of blood loss in multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of blood loss included decreasing degree of tumor embolization (P =.037), skull base location (P =.005), and male sex (P =.034). Embolization was not an independent predictor of gross total resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ennbolization is a safe option for selected nneningionnas. In our series embolization did not alter the operative duration, complications, or degree of resection, but the degree of embolization was an independent predictor of decreased operative blood loss.

   Manual Hippocampal Segmentation Protocol
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING

DT Article
DE Hippocampus; manual segmentation; magnetic resonance imaging; harmonized
   protocol; standard operating procedures
ID VOLUME MEASUREMENTS; MRI; AMYGDALA
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   An effort to define and validate a Harmonized Protocol for standard hippocampal segmentation is being carried out. We wished to estimate the effect of magnetic resonance image (MRI) spatial orientation on manual hippocampal segmentations to define optimal standard orientation of MRIs for hippocampal volumetry.
   METHODS
   Three expert tracers segmented twice the hippocampi of 10 ADNI subjects on MRI slices oriented perpendicular to the anterior-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line and the long hippocampal axes plane, following internationally harmonized landmarks. We computed intra and interrater reliability figures for total volumes and similarity coefficients.
   RESULTS
   Total volume reliability was similar for both orientations. Similarity coefficients were significantly higher for the AC-PC orientation (exact P = 0.002).
   DISCUSSION
   These data show that AC-PC orientation is slightly more reliable for manual segmentations, possibly due to better visualization of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces separating hippocampal head and amygdala. A Delphi panel of experts has used these data to decide on the optimal orientation for a Harmonized Protocol for hippocampal segmentation.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Attempts have been made to associate intracranial aneurysmal hemodynamics with aneurysm growth and rupture status. Hemodynamics in aneurysms is traditionally determined with computational fluid dynamics by using generalized inflow boundary conditions in a parent artery. Recently, patient-specific inflow boundary conditions are being implemented more frequently. Our purpose was to compare intracranial aneurysm hemodynamics based on generalized versus patient-specific inflow boundary conditions.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 36 patients, geometric models of aneurysms were determined by using 3D rotational angiography. 2D phase-contrast MR imaging velocity measurements of the parent artery were performed. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed twice: once by using patient-specific phase-contrast MR imaging velocity profiles and once by using generalized Womersley profiles as inflow boundary conditions. Resulting mean and maximum wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index values were analyzed, and hemodynamic characteristics were qualitatively compared.
   RESULTS: Quantitative analysis showed statistically significant differences for mean and maximum wall shear stress values between both inflow boundary conditions (P<.001). Qualitative assessment of hemodynamic characteristics showed differences in 21 cases: high wall shear stress location (n = 8), deflection location (n = 3), lobulation wall shear stress (n = 12), and/or vortex and inflow jet stability (n = 9). The latter showed more instability for the generalized inflow boundary conditions in 7 of 9 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using generalized and patient-specific inflow boundary conditions for computational fluid dynamics results in different wall shear stress magnitudes and hemodynamic characteristics. Generalized inflow boundary conditions result in more vortices and inflow jet instabilities. This study emphasizes the necessity of patient-specific inflow boundary conditions for calculation of hemodynamics in cerebral aneurysms by using computational fluid dynamics techniques.

ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; BRAIN PERFUSION; DIFFUSION; REPERFUSION; GLIOMAS;

AB Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging is an MRI perfusion technique that uses a diffusion-weighted sequence with multiple b values and a bi-compartmental signal model to measure the so-called pseudo-diffusion of blood caused by its passage through the microvascular network. The goal of the current study was to assess the feasibility of IVIM perfusion fraction imaging in patients with acute stroke.
   Images were collected in 17 patients with acute stroke. Exclusion criteria were onset of symptoms to imaging > 5 days, hemorrhagic transformation, infratentorial lesions, small lesions < 0.5 cm in minimal diameter and hemodynamic instability. IVIM imaging was performed at 3 T, using a standard spin-echo Stejskal-Tanner pulsed gradients diffusion-weighted sequence, using 16 b values from 0 to 900 s/mm(2). Image quality was assessed by two radiologists, and quantitative analysis was performed in regions of interest placed in the stroke area, defined by thresholding the apparent diffusion coefficient maps, as well as in the contralateral region.
   IVIM perfusion fraction maps showed an area of decreased perfusion fraction f in the region of decreased apparent diffusion coefficient. Quantitative analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in both IVIM perfusion fraction f (0.026 +/- 0.019 vs. 0.056 +/- 0.025, p = 2.2 center dot 10(-6)) and diffusion coefficient D compared with the contralateral side (3.9 A +/- 0.79 A center dot 10(-4) vs. 7.5 A +/- 0.86 A center dot 10(-4) mm(2)/s, p = 1.3 A center dot 10(-20)).
   IVIM perfusion fraction imaging is feasible in acute stroke. IVIM perfusion fraction is significantly reduced in the visible infarct. Further studies should evaluate the potential for IVIM to predict clinical outcome and treatment response.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging can provide in vivo assessment of the microvasculature in intracranial tumors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging derived vascular permeability parameters, including the volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant between the extravascular extracellular space and plasma, for the differentiation of primary CNS lymphoma and glioblastoma.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty glioblastomas and 11 primary central nervous system lymphomas were included. Pretreatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging with a 3D T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo sequence was performed on a 3T MR imaging scanner. Perfusion parameters (volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant) were measured on the basis of the Tofts-Kernmode model. The Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to compare those parameters between primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma. Histopathologic correlation of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging findings was performed by using reticulin staining and CD31 immunohistochemistry.
   RESULTS: Median volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values were significantly higher in primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.145 +/- 0.057 and 0.396 +/- 0.088) than in glioblastoma (0.064 +/- 0.021 and 0.230 +/- 0.058) (P < .001, respectively). Median volume of extravascular extracellular space values did not differ significantly between primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.434 +/- 0.165) and glioblastoma (0.319 +/- 0.107). On receiver operating characteristic analysis, volume transfer constant had the best discriminative value for differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma (threshold, 0.093; sensitivity, 90.9%; specificity, 95.0%). Histopathologic evaluation revealed intact vascular integrity in glioblastoma despite endothelial proliferation, whereas primary central nervous system lymphoma demonstrated destroyed vessel architecture, thereby promoting vascular disintegrity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Primary central nervous system lymphoma demonstrated significantly higher volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values compared with glioblastoma, implying a higher vascular permeability in primary central nervous system lymphoma. These findings confirm initial observations from perfusion CT and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging studies, correlating with underlying histopathologic features, and may be useful in distinguishing primary central nervous system lymphoma from glioblastoma.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   The natural history of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to anterior circulation large artery occlusion is not well established. This information is essential for assessment of clinical benefit derived from recanalization therapies.
   METHODS
   Patients with AIS due to anterior circulation large artery occlusion not treated with reperfusion therapies admitted from January 2005 to September 2010 were consecutively selected. Site of occlusion was assessed with transcranial duplex according to Thrombolysis in Brain Infarction (TIBI) grades. Poor outcome was considered as a modified Rankin Scale>2 at 90 days.
   RESULTS
   A total of 120 patients were studied. Site of occlusion was terminal internal carotid artery (TICA) in 13 (10.8%), proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 69 (57.5%), and distal MCA in 38 (31.7%) patients. Overall, 74.2% of patients had poor outcome. There were significant differences in poor outcome between patients with TICA, proximal MCA, and distal MCA occlusion (92%, 87%, 47%, P < .001) and mortality at 90 days (23%, 12%, 3%, P = .001).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Outcome of AIS patients with anterior circulation large artery occlusion not treated with reperfusion therapies is extremely poor in TICA and proximal MCA occlusions with better outcomes noted in distal MCA occlusions. These findings are relevant for estimation of treatment effect of reperfusion therapies according to occlusion location.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To determine whether voxel-based morphometry of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space can accurately differentiate iNPH from other related neurological disorders.
   METHODS
   Nineteen patients with surgically proven iNPH and 24 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 14 healthy elderlies were examined. Regions of interest (ROIs) in the ventricular/sylvian (VS) and high convexity/midline (HCM) areas were used in VBM, and differences in CSF volume within these ROIs among the 4 groups were examined.
   RESULTS
   The relative CSF volume in the VS-ROI in the iNPH group (.64) was significantly higher than that in the AD, PD, and healthy control groups (.26, .29, and .17, respectively; P < .001), whereas the relative CSF volume in the HCM-ROI was significantly reduced in the iNPH (.10) than in the other (.17, .16, and .16, respectively) groups (P < .001). Furthermore, the ratio of the 2 areas (VS/HCM) was markedly higher in the iNPH (6.87) than in the other (1.65, 1.74, .97, respectively) groups (P < .001), with sensitivity and specificity of .89 and 1.00, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The VBM-based CSF space analysis can detect disproportionate changes in CSF space and differentiate iNPH patients from those with AD or PD and healthy elderlies accurately.

DT Article
DE Perfusion imaging; cerebral angiography; intracranial vasospasm
ID ANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; CT PERFUSION;
   TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS; THEORETIC BASIS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Cerebral perfusion analysis is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm. A new modality of real-time cerebral perfusion imaging and analysis has been developed using standard 2-dimensional angiography. We report our initial experience with this technique to assess response to therapy during endovascular vasospasm procedures.
   METHODS
   Colorized angiographic perfusion maps were obtained immediately before and after endovascular vasospasm treatment. Semiquantitative perfusion parameters (cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, mean transit time, and time to peak) were calculated from time-density curves obtained from intraarterial contrast injection. The effects of intraarterial vasospasm therapy were assessed.
   RESULTS
   Eight vascular territories in 4 patients with vasospasm underwent interventional angiography and angiographic perfusion analysis. Pretreatment perfusion maps demonstrated variable perfusion deficits in specific vascular territories. After endovascular treatment in 6 vessels, improvement was seen to varying degrees in both angiographic appearance and perfusion parameters. Clinical improvement and reduction in transcranial Doppler velocity was also observed.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Real-time angiographic perfusion imaging is feasible during endovascular procedures for vasospasm. Perfusion analysis may aid in assessment of efficacy of the intervention. Comparison with traditional perfusion imaging is needed to validate this technique.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The multiparametric imaging can show us different aspects of tumor behavior and may help differentiation of tumor recurrence from treatment related change. Our aim was to differentiate tumor progression from pseudoprogression in patients with glioblastoma by using multiparametric histogram analysis of 2 consecutive MR imaging studies with relative cerebral blood volume and ADC values.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients with glioblastoma with new or increased size of enhancing lesions after concomitant chemoradiation therapy following surgical resection were included. Combined histograms were made by using the relative cerebral blood volume and ADC values of enhancing areas for initial and follow-up MR imaging, and subtracted histograms were also prepared. The histogram parameters between groups were compared. The diagnostic accuracy of tumor progression based on the histogram parameters of initial and follow-up MR imaging and subtracted histograms was compared and correlated with overall survival.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four pseudoprogressions and 11 tumor progressions were determined. Diagnosis based on the subtracted histogram mode with a multiparametric approach was more accurate than the diagnosis based on the uniparametric approach (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.877 versus 0.801), with 81.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity. A high mode of relative cerebral blood volume on the subtracted histogram by using a multiparametric approach (relative cerebral blood volume X ADC) was the best predictor of true tumor progression (P < .001) and worse survival (P = .003).
   CONCLUSIONS: Multiparametric histogram analysis of posttreatment glioblastoma was useful to predict true tumor progression and worse survival.

TI Detection and Grading of Endolymphatic Hydrops in Meniere Disease Using
   MR Imaging
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INNER-EAR; CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT; VISUALIZATION; INJECTION; IMAGES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endo lymphatic hydrops has been recognized as the underlying pathophysiology of Meniere disease. We used 3T MR imaging to detect and grade endolymphatic hydrops in patients with Meniere disease and to correlate MR imaging findings with the clinical severity.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR images of the inner ear acquired by a 3D inversion recovery sequence 4 hours after intravenous contrast administration were retrospectively analyzed by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to the clinical presentation. Endo lymphatic hydrops was classified as none, grade I, or grade II. Interobserver agreement was analyzed, and the presence of endolymphatic hydrops was correlated with the clinical diagnosis and the clinical Meniere disease score.
   RESULTS: Of 53 patients, we identified endolymphatic hydrops in 90% on the clinically affected and in 22% on the clinically silent side. Interobserver agreement on detection and grading of endolymphatic hydrops was 0.97 for cochlear and 0.94 for vestibular hydrops. The average MR imaging grade of endolymphatic hydrops was 1.27 +/- 0.66 for 55 clinically affected and 0.65 +/- 0.58 for 10 clinically normal ears. The correlation between the presence of endolymphatic hydrops and Meniere disease was 0.67. Endolymphatic hydrops was detected in 73% of ears with the clinical diagnosis of possible, 100% of probable, and 95% of definite Meniere disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging supports endolymphatic hydrops as a pathophysiologic hallmark of Meniere disease. High interobserver agreement on the detection and grading of endolymphatic hydrops and the correlation of MR imaging findings with the clinical score recommend MR imaging as a reliable in vivo technique in patients with Meniere disease. The significance of MR imaging detection of endolymphatic hydrops in an additional 22% of asymptomatic ears requires further study.

DT Article
ID HEMORRHAGIC PRESENTATION; FEATURES; RISK
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The imaging characteristics and modes of presentation of brain AVMs may vary with patient age. Our aim was to determine whether clinical and angioarchitectural features of brain AVMs differ between children and adults.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospectively collected institutional data base of all patients diagnosed with brain AVMs since 2001 was queried. Demographic, clinical, and angioarchitecture information was summarized and analyzed with univariable and multivariable models.
   RESULTS: Results often differed when age was treated as a continuous variable as opposed to dividing subjects into children (18 years or younger; n = 203) versus adults (older than 18 years; n = 630). Children were more likely to present with AVM hemorrhage than adults (59% versus 41%, P < .001). Although AVMs with a larger nidus presented at younger ages (mean of 26.8 years for >6 cm compared with 37.1 years for <3 cm), this feature was not significantly different between children and adults (P = .069). Exclusively deep venous drainage was more common in younger subjects when age was treated continuously (P = .04) or dichotomized (P < .001). Venous ectasia was more common with increasing age (mean, 39.4 years with ectasia compared with 31.1 years without ectasia) and when adults were compared with children (52% versus 35%, P < .001). Patients with feeding artery aneurysms presented at a later average age (44.1 years) than those without such aneurysms (31.6 years); this observation persisted when comparing children with adults (13% versus 29%, P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although children with brain AVMs were more likely to come to clinical attention due to hemorrhage than adults, venous ectasia and feeding artery aneurysms were under-represented in children, suggesting that these particular high-risk features take time to develop.

TI Glioma: Application of Histogram Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters
   from T1-Weighted Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MR Imaging to Tumor Grading
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME; BRAIN-TUMORS; QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT;
   HISTOLOGIC GRADE; LEAKAGE SPACE; PERMEABILITY; ANGIOGENESIS; T1
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The usefulness of pharmacokinetic parameters for glioma grading has been reported based on the perfusion data from parts of entire-tumor volumes. However, the perfusion values may not reflect the entire-tumor characteristics. Our aim was to investigate the feasibility of glioma grading by using histogram analyses of pharmacokinetic parameters including the volume transfer constant, extravascular extracellular space volume per unit volume of tissue, and blood plasma volume per unit volume of tissue from T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (14 men, 14 women; mean age, 49.75 years; age range, 25-72 years) with histopathologically confirmed gliomas (World Health Organization grade II, n = 7; grade III, n = 8; grade IV, n = 13) were examined before surgery or biopsy with conventional MR imaging and T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging at 3T. Volume transfer constant, extravascular extracellular space volume per unit volume of tissue, and blood plasma volume per unit volume of tissue were calculated from the entire-tumor volume. Histogram analyses from these parameters were correlated with glioma grades. The parameters with the best percentile from cumulative histograms were identified by analysis of the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic analysis and were compared by using multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis for distinguishing high- from low-grade gliomas.
   RESULTS: All parametric values increased with increasing glioma grade. There were significant differences among the 3 grades in all parameters (P < .01). For the differentiation of high- and low-grade gliomas, the highest area under the curve values were found at the 98th percentile of the volume transfer constant (area under the curve, 0.912; cutoff value, 0.277), the 90th percentile of extravascular extracellular space volume per unit volume of tissue (area under the curve, 0.939; cutoff value, 19.70), and the 84th percentile of blood plasma volume per unit volume of tissue (area under the curve, 0.769; cutoff value, 11.71). The 98th percentile volume transfer constant value was the only variable that could be used to independently differentiate high- and low-grade gliomas in multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Histogram analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters from whole-tumor volume data can be a useful method for glioma grading. The 98th percentile value of the volume transfer constant was the most significant measure.

TI Imaging Findings in MR Imaging-Guided Focused Ultrasound Treatment for
   Patients with Essential Tremor
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

DT Article
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BRAIN; RELIABILITY; PREVALENCE; COMMUNITY; THERAPIES;
   SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging-guided focused sonography surgery is a new stereotactic technique that uses high-intensity focused sonography to heat and ablate tissue. The goal of this study was to describe MR imaging findings pre- and post-ventralis intermedius nucleus lesioning by MR imaging-guided focused sonography as a treatment for essential tremor and to determine whether there was an association between these imaging features and the clinical response to MR imaging-guided focused sonography.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with medication-refractory essential tremor prospectively gave consent; were enrolled in a single-site, FDA-approved pilot clinical trial; and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused sonography. MR imaging studies were obtained on a 3T scanner before the procedure and 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months following the procedure.
   RESULTS: On T2-weighted imaging, 3 time-dependent concentric zones were seen at the site of the focal spot. The inner 2 zones showed reduced ADC values at 24 hours in all patients except one. Diffusion had pseudonormalized by 1 month in all patients, when the cavity collapsed. Very mild postcontrast enhancement was seen at 24 hours and again at 1 month after MR imaging-guided focused sonography. The total lesion size and clinical response evolved inversely compared with each other (coefficient of correlation = 0.29, P value = .02).
   CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging-guided focused sonography can accurately ablate a precisely delineated target, with typical imaging findings seen in the days, weeks, and months following the treatment. Tremor control was optimal early when the lesion size and perilesional edema were maximal and was less later when the perilesional edema had resolved.

   TREATMENT; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSM; LIGATION; OCCLUSION; EMBOLIZATION;
   EXPERIENCE; HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysms of the cavernous segment of the ICA are difficult to treat with standard endovascular techniques, and ICA sacrifice achieves a high rate of occlusion but carries an elevated level of surgical complications and risk of de novo aneurysm formation. We report rates of occlusion and treatment-related data in 44 patients with cavernous sinus aneurysms treated with flow diversion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with cavernous segment aneurysms treated with flow diversion were selected from a prospectively maintained data base of patients from 2009 to the present. Demographic information, treatment indications, number/type of flow diverters placed, outcome, complications (technical or clinical), and clinical/imaging follow-up data were analyzed.
   RESULTS: We identified 44 patients (37 females, 7 males) who had a flow diverter placed for treatment of a cavernous ICA aneurysm (mean age, 57.2; mean aneurysm size, 20.9 mm). The mean number of devices placed per patient was 2.2. At final angiographic follow-up (mean, 10.9 months), 71% had complete occlusion, and of those with incomplete occlusion, 40% had minimal remnants (<3 mm). In symptomatic patients, complete resolution or significant improvement in symptoms was noted in 90% at follow-up. Technical complications (which included, among others, vessel perforation in 4 patients, groin hematoma in 2, and asymptomatic carotid occlusion in 1) occurred in approximately 36% of patients but did not result in any clinical sequelae immediately or at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our series of flow-diversion treatments achieved markedly greater rates of complete occlusion than coiling, with a safety profile that compares favorably with that of carotid sacrifice.

   RESTORATION; THERAPY; REVASCULARIZATION; RECANALIZATION; MULTICENTER
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Basilar artery occlusion remains one of the most devastating subtypes of ischemic stroke. The prognosis is poor if early recanalization is not achieved. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of self-expanding retrievable stents in the endovascular treatment of acute basilar artery occlusion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with acute basilar artery occlusion were treated with Solitaire FR or Revive SE devices between December 2009 and May 2012. Additional treatment included intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis (21/24) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/permanent stent placement (7/24). Recanalization was assessed by means of the TICI score. Clinical outcome was determined at discharge (NIHSS), and at 3 months (mRS).
   RESULTS: Median NIHSS score on admission was 24; median duration of symptoms was 254 minutes. Successful recanalization (TICI 2b + 3) by thrombectomy only was achieved in 18 patients (75%). Intracranial stent deployment after thrombectomy caused by underlying atherosclerotic stenosis was performed in 7 patients. If these patients with intracranial stent placement are included, successful recanalization was achieved in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%). NIHSS improvement >= 10 points was reached in 54% of patients (n = 13/24). Mortality during the first 3 months was 29% (7/24). After 3 months, 8 patients (33%) had a favorable clinical outcome (mRS 0-2).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our series, application of self-expanding retrievable stents in acute basilar artery occlusion resulted in a high recanalization rate without procedural complications and good clinical outcome in one-third of patients.

   PLACEMENT; FLOW-DISRUPTION; EMBOLIZATION; MULTICENTER; IMMEDIATE;
   SOLITAIRE; TRISPAN
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pCONus is a new stentlike self-expanding nitinol implant with 4 distal petals, which is fully retrievable and electrolytically detachable. The distal end is implanted inside the aneurysm at the neck. The shaft is anchored in the parent vessel. In selected wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms, the pCONus was used to assist coiling. The device was evaluated for its safety and efficacy.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with 28 wide-neck aneurysms (9 recently ruptured) were treated with pCONus-assisted coiling at the discretion of the operator. Other treatment options were considered but were discarded due to anticipated difficulties. Technical issues, immediate posttreatment angiographic findings, clinical outcome, and follow-up imaging were assessed.
   RESULTS: There were 11 MCA, 7 anterior communicating artery, 1 posterior cerebral artery, 1 A2, and 8 basilar artery aneurysms. Insertion and deployment of the pCONus and subsequent coiling were possible in all cases. There were no clinically evident complications associated with the use of the device. Initial anatomic outcome showed 8 complete occlusions, 9 neck remnants, and 11 incomplete occlusions. Neurologic status remained unchanged at follow-up. Angiographic controls were obtained in 22 patients (mean, 7.5 months). Of these, 13 had complete occlusion, 9 showed improvement, and 7 were unchanged. Four died from SAH sequelae or other diseases, and 2 have not yet undergone follow-up. No intimal hyperplasia was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pCONus facilitates coil occlusion of unruptured and ruptured wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. The device can be deployed safely. Coil retention is sufficient to protect the efferent vessels. So far, no intimal hyperplasia in the shaft has been observed.

TI Carotid Artery Dissection due to Elongated Styloid Process: A
   Self-Stabbing Phenomenon
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING

DT Article
DE Carotid dissection; elongated styloid; stroke
ID EAGLE SYNDROME
AB Elongated styloid process (ESP) is an anatomical variant that has been described as the cause of Eagle syndrome. Until recently, the styloid process has not been appreciated as a significant contributor to carotid artery dissection (CAD), which is not part of Eagle syndrome. We present a case of a 41-year-old male who presented with acute right middle cerebral artery occlusion and was found to have ESP projecting to and abutting the lateral wall of a dissected right internal carotid artery (ICA). Forced sustained head turning with maximal muscle contraction was the initiating event driving the styloid process into the wall of the ICA in a manner that can be likened to being stabbed with a pointed object. Knowing the association between ESP, Eagle syndrome, and CAD shall lead to increased awareness and appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the pREset stent retriever in a real-world clinical setting.
   Patients treated with pREset were selected from a prospectively maintained single-center database. A TICI score a parts per thousand yen2b after a parts per thousand currency sign3 passes was regarded as successful recanalization. All device-related complications and their clinical significance were reported. Parenchymal hematomas (PH) were classified according to ECASS, adding focal and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as categories. A 90-day mRS of 0-2 was defined as favorable outcome. In addition, we separately analyzed patients treated with > 3 pREset passes and patients receiving other rescue maneuvers.
   We included 271 patients. Successful recanalization was achieved in 76.4 %. Device-related complications occurred in 9.2 % of which 2.2 % were clinically significant. PH I, PH II, focal SAH, and diffuse SAH was observed in 5.2, 4.8, 12.2, and 2.2 %, respectively. A total of 39.5 % of patients had favorable clinical outcome. Considering treatments with > 3 pREset passes or other rescue procedures, an additional 8.5 and 9.3 % of target vessels were recanalized. The chance of favorable clinical outcome decreased significantly with any kind of rescue therapy. In addition, the rate of PH I was significantly higher in patients treated with > 3 pREset passes, whereas all other types of hemorrhage showed no difference.
   In terms of safety and effectiveness, pREset performed comparably to other stent retriever devices. To avoid futile recanalization and potential additional harm, escalation of therapy beyond three thrombectomy passes should only be performed after careful individual consideration of each case.

TI Hemorrhagic Complications after Endovascular Treatment of Cerebral
   Arteriovenous Malformations
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PREOPERATIVE EMBOLIZATION; OCCLUSIVE HYPEREMIA; MANAGEMENT; RESECTION;
   NIDUS; RISK
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial hemorrhage is the most severe complication of brain arteriovenous malformation treatment. We report our rate of hemorrhagic complications after endovascular treatment and analyze the clinical significance and potential mechanisms, with emphasis on cases of delayed hemorrhage after uneventful embolization.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 10-year period, 846 embolization procedures were performed in 408 patients with brain AVMs. Any cases of hemorrhagic complications were identified and divided into those related or unrelated to a periprocedural arterial tear (during catheter navigation or catheter retrieval). We analyzed the following variables: sex, age, hemorrhagic presentation, Spetzler-Martin grade, size of the AVM, number of embolized pedicles, microcatheter used, type and volume of liquid embolic agent injected, and the presence of a premature venous occlusion. Univariate and multivariate multiple regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for hemorrhagic complications.
   RESULTS: A hemorrhagic complication occurred in 92 (11%) procedures. Forty-four (48%) complications were related to a periprocedural arterial perforation, and 48 (52%) were not. Hemorrhagic complications unrelated to an arterial perforation were located more commonly in the cerebral parenchyma, caused more neurologic deficits, and were associated with worse prognosis than those in the arterial perforation group. Only premature venous occlusion was identified as an independent predictor of hemorrhagic complication in the nonperforation group. Premature venous occlusion was significantly related to the ratio of Onyx volume to nidus diameter.
   CONCLUSIONS: Higher injected volume of embolic agent and deposition on the venous outflow before complete occlusion of the AVM may account for severe hemorrhagic complications.

LA English
DT Article
ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; INTRAVENOUS THROMBOLYSIS; INTRAARTERIAL; DEVICE;
   THERAPY; TRIAL; REVASCULARIZATION; EXPERIENCE; RETRIEVERS; TIME
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever applied shortly after symptom onset could increase good functional outcomes and improve survival in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion, but this has not yet been studied. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire stent within 8 hours of stroke onset in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 25 consecutive patients with acute basilar artery occlusion who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy by use of the Solitaire stent within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset. Successful recanalization was defined as TICI grade 2b or 3. Good outcome was defined as mRS score of 0-2 at 3 months. Clinical and radiologic data in patients with good outcomes were compared with those with poor outcomes.
   RESULTS: Successful recanalization was achieved in 96% (24/25) of patients, and 48% (12/25) of patients had good outcomes. Eighty-eight percent (22/25) of patients survived to 3 months. The median NIHSS score on admission was significantly lower in patients with good outcomes than in those with poor outcomes (9.5 versus 14, P = .005). Procedure-related complications occurred in 2 patients (8%). No symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that mechanical thrombectomy by use of a Solitaire stent within 8 hours of stroke onset increases good outcomes and improves survival in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion.

   RESEARCH-PROJECT; TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION; CEREBELLAR TUMORS;

   COEFFICIENTS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Qualitative radiologic MR imaging review affords limited differentiation among types of pediatric posterior fossa brain tumors and cannot detect histologic or molecular subtypes, which could help to stratify treatment. This study aimed to improve current posterior fossa discrimination of histologic tumor type by using support vector machine classifiers on quantitative MR imaging features.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included preoperative MRI in 40 children with posterior fossa tumors (17 medulloblastomas, 16 pilocytic astrocytomas, and 7 ependymomas). Shape, histogram, and textural features were computed from contrast-enhanced T2WI and T1WI and diffusivity (ADC) maps. Combinations of features were used to train tumor-type-specific classifiers for medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, and ependymoma types in separation and as a joint posterior fossa classifier. A tumor-subtype classifier was also produced for classic medulloblastoma. The performance of different classifiers was assessed and compared by using randomly selected subsets of training and test data.
   RESULTS: ADC histogram features (25th and 75th percentiles and skewness) yielded the best classification of tumor type (on average >95.8% of medulloblastomas, >96.9% of pilocytic astrocytomas, and >94.3% of ependymomas by using 8 training samples). The resulting joint posterior fossa classifier correctly assigned >91.4% of the posterior fossa tumors. For subtype classification, 89.4% of classic medulloblastomas were correctly classified on the basis of ADC texture features extracted from the Gray-Level Co-Occurence Matrix.
   CONCLUSIONS: Support vector machine-based classifiers using ADC histogram features yielded very good discrimination among pediatric posterior fossa tumor types, and ADC textural features show promise for further subtype discrimination. These findings suggest an added diagnostic value of quantitative feature analysis of diffusion MR imaging in pediatric neuro-oncology.

TI Pretreatment ADC Histogram Analysis Is a Predictive Imaging Biomarker
   for Bevacizumab Treatment but Not Chemotherapy in Recurrent Glioblastoma
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CELL INVASION; SURVIVAL; GROWTH; PROGRESSION; IMAGES; MAPS; VEGF
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   Pre-treatment ADC characteristics have been shown to predict response to bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. However, no studies have examined whether ADC characteristics are specific to this particular treatment. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether ADC histogram analysis is a bevacizumab-specific or treatment-independent biomarker of treatment response in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   Eighty-nine bevacizumab-treated and 43 chemotherapy-treated recurrent glioblastoma multiformes never exposed to bevacizumab were included in this study. In all patients, ADC values in contrast-enhancing ROIs from MR imaging examinations performed at the time of recurrence, immediately before commencement of treatment for recurrence, were extracted and the resulting histogram was fitted to a mixed model with a double Gaussian distribution. Mean ADC in the lower Gaussian curve was used as the primary biomarker of interest. The Cox proportional hazards model and log-rank tests were used for survival analysis.
   RESULTS:
   Cox multivariate regression analysis accounting for the interaction between bevacizumab- and non-bevacizumab-treated patients suggested that the ability of the lower Gaussian curve to predict survival is dependent on treatment (progression-free survival, P = .045; overall survival, P = .003). Patients with bevacizumab-treated recurrent glioblastoma multiforme with a pretreatment lower Gaussian curve > 1.2 mu m(2)/ms had a significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival compared with bevacizumab-treated patients with a lower Gaussian curve < 1.2 mu m(2)/ms. No differences in progression-free survival or overall survival were observed in the chemotherapy-treated cohort. Bevacizumab-treated patients with a mean lower Gaussian curve > 1.2 mu m(2)/ms had a significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemotherapy-treated patients.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   The mean lower Gaussian curve from ADC histogram analysis is a predictive imaging biomarker for bevacizumab-treated, not chemotherapy-treated, recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme with a mean lower Gaussian curve > 1.2 mu m(2)/ms have a survival advantage when treated with bevacizumab.

AB We aim to investigate the clinical onset, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings, and follow-up of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-related inflammation, an uncommon but clinically striking presentation of CAA.
   We retrospectively reviewed the clinical manifestations, CT/MR imaging findings, and outcome of ten consecutive patients with CAA-related inflammation. In each patient, a brain CT study was performed at hospital admission, and brain MR imaging was carried out 2 to 4 days later. Clinical and radiologic follow-up findings were evaluated in all patients.
   The most common clinical onset was rapidly progressive cognitive decline, followed by focal neurological signs. Brain CT/MR showed unenhanced expansive subcortical lesions, corresponding to areas of vasogenic edema, associated with chronic lobar, cortical, or cortical-subcortical micro/macrohemorrhages. Clinical symptoms recovered in a few weeks under treatment in eight patients and spontaneously in the remaining two. MRI follow-up at 2 to 12 months after treatment showed resolution of the lesions. Three patients experienced symptomatic disease recurrence, with new lesions on CT/MR.
   In the absence of histological data, early recognition of the clinical symptoms and typical radiologic features of CAA-related inflammation is essential to enable timely establishment of proper treatment.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   Diffusional kurtosis imaging is an extension of DTI but includes non-Gaussian diffusion effects, allowing more comprehensive characterization of microstructural changes during brain development. Our purpose was to use diffusional kurtosis imaging to measure age-related microstructural changes in both the WM and GM of the developing human brain.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   Diffusional kurtosis imaging was performed in 59 subjects ranging from birth to 4 years 7 months of age. Diffusion metrics, fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis were collected from VOIs within multiple WM and GM structures and subsequently analyzed with respect to age. Diffusional kurtosis tractography images at various stages of development were also generated.
   RESULTS:
   Fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis both showed age-related increases in all WM regions, reflecting progression of diffusional anisotropy throughout development, predominantly in the first 2 years of life (eg, 70% and 157% increase in fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis, respectively, from birth to 2 years for the splenium). However, mean kurtosis detected continued microstructural changes in WM past the fractional anisotropy plateau, accounting for more delayed isotropic changes (eg, 90% of maximum fractional anisotropy was reached at 5 months, whereas 90% of maximum mean kurtosis occurred at 18 months for the external capsule). Mean kurtosis may also provide greater characterization of GM maturation (eg, the putamen showed no change in fractional anisotropy but an 81% change in mean kurtosis from birth to 4 years 7 months).
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Mean kurtosis detects significant microstructural changes consistent with known patterns of brain maturation. In comparison with fractional anisotropy, mean kurtosis may offer a more comprehensive evaluation of age-related microstructural changes in both WM and GM and is potentially a valuable technique for studying brain development.

   ANEURYSMS; EXPERIENCE
AB The long-term complications of coil treatment of giant intracranial aneurysms were assessed in 334 instances when treatment consisted of only coiling (225), stent-assisted coiling (88), parent vessel occlusion (14), or balloon-assisted coiling (7). The authors concluded that coiling of large and giant aneurysms has reasonable safety profiles with good clinical outcomes, but aneurysm reopening was common. Stent-assisted coiling had lower recurrence, retreatment, and new or recurrent hemorrhage rates with no additional morbidity compared with conventional coiling. Aneurysm size was a major determinant of recanalization, retreatment, new or recurrent hemorrhage, and poor outcome.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   Large and giant intracranial aneurysms are increasingly treated with endovascular techniques. The goal of this study was to retrospectively analyze the complications and long-term results of coiling in large and giant aneurysms (>= 10 mm) and identify predictors of outcome.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   A total of 334 large or giant aneurysms (>= 10 mm) were coiled in our institution between 2004 and 2011. Medical charts and imaging studies were reviewed to determine baseline characteristics, procedural complications, and clinical/angiographic outcomes. Aneurysm size was 15 mm on average. Two hundred twenty-five aneurysms were treated with conventional coiling; 88, with stent-assisted coiling; 14, with parent vessel occlusion; and 7, with balloon-assisted coiling.
   RESULTS:
   Complications occurred in 10.5% of patients, with 1 death (0.3%). Aneurysm location and ruptured aneurysms predicted complications. Angiographic follow-up was available for 84% of patients at 25.4 months on average. Recanalization and retreatment rates were 39% and 33%, respectively. Larger aneurysm size, increasing follow-up time, conventional coiling, and aneurysm location predicted both recurrence and retreatment. The annual rebleeding rate was 1.9%. Larger aneurysm size, increasing follow-up time, and aneurysm location predicted new or recurrent hemorrhage. Favorable outcomes occurred in 92% of patients. Larger aneurysm size, poor Hunt and Hess grades, and new or recurrent hemorrhage predicted poor outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Coiling of large and giant aneurysms has a reasonable safety profile with good clinical outcomes, but aneurysm reopening remains very common. Stent-assisted coiling has lower recurrence, retreatment, and new or recurrent hemorrhage rates with no additional morbidity compared with conventional coiling. Aneurysm size was a major determinant of recanalization, retreatment, new or recurrent hemorrhage, and poor outcome.

AB The purpose of this paper is to assess the value of 7 Tesla (7 T) MRI for the depiction of brain stem and cranial nerve (CN) anatomy.
   Six volunteers were examined at 7 T using high-resolution SWI, MPRAGE, MP2RAGE, 3D SPACE T2, T2, and PD images to establish scanning parameters targeted at optimizing spatial resolution. Direct comparisons between 3 and 7 T were performed in two additional subjects using the finalized sequences (3 T: T2, PD, MPRAGE, SWAN; 7 T: 3D T2, MPRAGE, SWI, MP2RAGE). Artifacts and the depiction of structures were evaluated by two neuroradiologists using a standardized score sheet.
   Sequences could be established for high-resolution 7 T imaging even in caudal cranial areas. High in-plane resolution T2, PD, and SWI images provided depiction of inner brain stem structures such as pons fibers, raphe, reticular formation, nerve roots, and periaqueductal gray. MPRAGE and MP2RAGE provided clear depiction of the CNs. 3D T2 images improved depiction of inner brain structure in comparison to T2 images at 3 T. Although the 7-T SWI sequence provided improved contrast to some inner structures, extended areas were influenced by artifacts due to image disturbances from susceptibility differences.
   Seven-tesla imaging of basal brain areas is feasible and might have significant impact on detection and diagnosis in patients with specific diseases, e.g., trigeminal pain related to affection of the nerve root. Some inner brain stem structures can be depicted at 3 T, but certain sequences at 7 T, in particular 3D SPACE T2, are superior in producing anatomical in vivo images of deep brain stem structures.

AB Adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) can decrease image noise, thereby generating CT images of comparable diagnostic quality with less radiation. The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of systematic use of ASIR versus filtered back projection (FBP) for neuroradiology CT protocols on patients' radiation dose and image quality.
   We evaluated the effect of ASIR on six types of neuroradiologic CT studies: adult and pediatric unenhanced head CT, adult cervical spine CT, adult cervical and intracranial CT angiography, adult soft tissue neck CT with contrast, and adult lumbar spine CT. For each type of CT study, two groups of 100 consecutive studies were retrospectively reviewed: 100 studies performed with FBP and 100 studies performed with ASIR/FBP blending factor of 40 %/60 % with appropriate noise indices. The weighted volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose-length product (DLP) and noise were recorded. Each study was also reviewed for image quality by two reviewers. Continuous and categorical variables were compared by t test and free permutation test, respectively.
   For adult unenhanced brain CT, CT cervical myelography, cervical and intracranial CT angiography and lumbar spine CT both CTDIvol and DLP were lowered by up to 10.9 % (p < 0.001), 17.9 % (p = 0.005), 20.9 % (p < 0.001), and 21.7 % (p = 0.001), respectively, by using ASIR compared with FBP alone. Image quality and noise were similar for both FBP and ASIR.
   We recommend routine use of iterative reconstruction for neuroradiology CT examinations because this approach affords a significant dose reduction while preserving image quality.

TI Semiautomated Volumetric Measurement on Postcontrast MR Imaging for
   Analysis of Recurrent and Residual Disease in Glioblastoma Multiforme
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA; SOLID TUMORS; SURVIVAL; GLIOMAS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   A limitation in postoperative monitoring of patients with glioblastoma is the lack of objective measures to quantify residual and recurrent disease. Automated computer-assisted volumetric analysis of contrast-enhancing tissue represents a potential tool to aid the radiologist in following these patients. In this study, we hypothesize that computer-assisted volumetry will show increased precision and speed over conventional 1D and 2D techniques in assessing residual and/or recurrent tumor.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   This retrospective study included patients with native glioblastomas with MR imaging performed at 24-48 hours following resection and 2-4 months postoperatively. 1D and 2D measurements were performed by 2 neuroradiologists with Certificates of Added Qualification. Volumetry was performed by using manual segmentation and computer-assisted volumetry, which combines region-based active contours and a level set approach. Tumor response was assessed by using established 1D, 2D, and volumetric standards. Manual and computer-assisted volumetry segmentation times were compared. Interobserver correlation was determined among 1D, 2D, and volumetric techniques.
   RESULTS:
   Twenty-nine patients were analyzed. Discrepancy in disease status between 1D and 2D compared with computer-assisted volumetry was 10.3% (3/29) and 17.2% (5/29), respectively. The mean time for segmentation between manual and computer-assisted volumetry techniques was 9.7 minutes and < 1 minute, respectively (P < .01). Interobserver correlation was highest for volumetric measurements (0.995; 95% CI, 0.990-0.997) compared with 1D (0.826; 95% CI, 0.695-0.904) and 2D (0.905; 95% CI, 0.828-0.948) measurements.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Computer-assisted volumetry provides a reproducible and faster volumetric assessment of enhancing tumor burden, which has implications for monitoring disease progression and quantification of tumor burden in treatment trials.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEBrain metastases from prostate cancer are uncommon and their imaging appearance has not been well defined. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the incidence, MRI characteristics, and prognosis of parenchymal brain metastases originating in prostate cancer.
   METHODSWe retrospectively identified 21 patients with prostate cancer and evidence of brain metastases from 2000 to 2010. We reviewed the initial brain MRI scans and characterized the lesions according to location and appearance on MRI, while also determining patient demography, staging, and survival.
   RESULTSThe incidence of brain metastasis from prostate cancer was .16%. At the time of brain metastasis detection, 95% of the patients had concurrent osseous metastases, 86% lymph node metastases, and 76% liver and/or lung metastases. Brain metastases were multifocal in 71% of patients, hemorrhagic in 33%, diffusion restricted in 19%, and partially cystic/necrotic in 19%. The median overall survival after brain metastasis detection was 2.8 months.
   CONCLUSIONSBrain metastasis from prostate cancer remains a rare phenomenon that most frequently occurs in the setting of widely disseminated bone and soft tissue disease. Patients with nonadenocarcinoma pathology are more likely to develop brain metastases. The MRI appearance is highly variable and prognosis is poor.

TI Diffusion Measures Indicate Fight Exposure-Related Damage to Cerebral
   White Matter in Boxers and Mixed Martial Arts Fighters

AB Boxers and mixed martial arts athletes underwent brain DTI and the results were correlated with number of fights, knockouts, age, weight, and years of education. Total knockouts in boxers increased diffusivity in the corpus callosum, cingulate, pericalcarine, precuneus, and amygdala, while in martial arts athletes only the posterior cingulate was abnormal. Thus, fight exposure but not the number of fights can be used to predict microstructural brain damage.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traumatic brain injury is common in fighting athletes such as boxers, given the frequency of blows to the head. Because DTI is sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter, this technique is often used to investigate white matter integrity in patients with traumatic brain injury. We hypothesized that previous fight exposure would predict DTI abnormalities in fighting athletes after controlling for individual variation.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 74 boxers and 81 mixed martial arts fighters were included in the analysis and scanned by use of DTI. Individual information and data on fight exposures, including number of fights and knockouts, were collected. A multiple hierarchical linear regression model was used in region-of-interest analysis to test the hypothesis that fight-related exposure could predict DTI values separately in boxers and mixed martial arts fighters. Age, weight, and years of education were controlled to ensure that these factors would not account for the hypothesized effects.
   RESULTS: We found that the number of knockouts among boxers predicted increased longitudinal diffusivity and transversal diffusivity in white matter and subcortical gray matter regions, including corpus callosum, isthmus cingulate, pericalcarine, precuneus, and amygdala, leading to increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy in the corresponding regions. The mixed martial arts fighters had increased transversal diffusivity in the posterior cingulate. The number of fights did not predict any DTI measures in either group.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the history of fight exposure in a fighter population can be used to predict microstructural brain damage.

TI Quantifying the Large-Scale Hemodynamics of Intracranial Aneurysms
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; FLOW; INFLAMMATION; MECHANISMS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemodynamics play an important role in the mechanisms that govern the initiation, growth, and possible rupture of intracranial aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to objectively characterize these dynamics, classify them, and connect them to aneurysm rupture.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Image-based computational fluid dynamic simulations were used to re-create the hemodynamics of 210 patient-specific intracranial aneurysm geometries. The hemodynamics were then classified according to their spatial complexity and temporal stability by using quantities derived from vortex core lines and proper orthogonal decomposition.
   RESULTS: The quantitative classification was compared with a previous qualitative classification performed by visual inspection. Receiver operating characteristic curves provided area-under-the-curve estimates for spatial complexity (0.905) and temporal stability (0.85) to show that the 2 classifications were in agreement. Statistically significant differences were observed in the quantities describing the hemodynamics of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Specifically, ruptured aneurysms had more complex and more unstable flow patterns than unruptured aneurysms. Spatial complexity was more strongly associated with rupture than temporal stability.
   CONCLUSIONS: Complex-unstable blood flow dynamics characterized by longer core line length and higher entropy could induce biologic processes that predispose an aneurysm for rupture.

ID AXONAL INJURY; SPATIAL STATISTICS; DIFFUSION; NEUROPLASTICITY; MODERATE;
   TIME
AB The authors used DTI to study posttraumatic white matter changes over a 5-year period. Thirteen patients with severe injuries acutely showed significant fractional anisotropy decreases in the corpus callosum and corona radiata when compared with controls. These abnormalities progressed at 2 years and then remained stable until 5 years. The DTI abnormalities correlated with sequelae such as amnesia, aphasia, and dyspraxia.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extensive white matter damage has been documented in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, yet how this damage evolves in the long term is not well understood. We used DTI to study white matter changes at 5 years after traumatic brain injury.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 8 healthy control participants and 13 patients with severe traumatic brain injury who were enrolled in a prospective observational study, which included clinical assessment and brain MR imaging in the acute setting (< 6 weeks) and 2 years and 5 years after injury. Only subjects with mild to moderate disability or no disability at 1 year were included in this analysis. DTI parameters were measured in 20 different brain regions and were normalized to values obtained in an age-matched control group.
   RESULTS: In the acute setting, fractional anisotropy was significantly lower in the genu and body of the corpus callosum and in the bilateral corona radiata in patients compared with control participants, whereas radial diffusivity was significantly (P < .05) higher in these tracts. At 2 years, fractional anisotropy in these tracts had further decreased and radial diffusivity had increased. No significant changes were detected between 2 and 5 years after injury. The baseline radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values in the anterior aspect of the brain stem, genu and body of the corpus callosum, and the right and left corona radiata were significantly (P < .05) associated with neurocognitive sequelae (including amnesia, aphasia, and dyspraxia) at year 5.
   CONCLUSIONS: DTI changes in major white matter tracts persist up to 5 years after severe traumatic brain injury and are most pronounced in the corpus callosum and corona radiata. Limited structural change is noted in the interval between 2 and 5 years.

TI Computational Hemodynamics Analysis of Intracranial Aneurysms Treated
   with Flow Diverters: Correlation with Clinical Outcomes
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CEREBRAL ANEURYSM; SUBJECT; RUPTURE; STENTS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies have shown promising results regarding intracranial aneurysms treated with flow diverters. However, these have had adverse effects, including delayed aneurysm occlusion, posttreatment symptoms, and rupture. The hemodynamic profiles of aneurysms treated with flow diverters were analyzed to determine the ones associated with successful and failed treatments.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics were used to simulate hemodynamic profiles, including the presence of jet flow, energy loss, volume flow, and wall shear stress in 4 successful occlusions of aneurysms and 4 failed cases after flow-diverter deployment. In these 4 failed cases, hemodynamic profiles were examined again after a hypothetic second intervention. This involved replacing the failed flow diverter with a hypothetic optimally deployed flow diverter or simulated placement of a second flow diverter within the first (double hypothetic optimally deployed).
   RESULTS: Where successful occlusions were achieved, a marked obliteration of jet flow was observed. Flow entering the aneurysm sac was diverted via the center of the flow diverter and joined smoothly with the continuation of flow leaving the aneurysm sac into the parent arteries. These observations were supplemented by a reduction in the other hemodynamic profiles. Aneurysm neck geometry might influence the efficacy of the flow diverter.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic indices, as calculated by using computational fluid dynamics techniques, have close correlation with flow-diverter treatment outcome. Computational fluid dynamics could be potentially useful as a planning tool for neurointerventionists by simulating an optimized flow-diverter deployment strategy before the procedure and evaluating posttreatment outcome.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSETo examine the distributions of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) observed metabolites in Parkinson's disease (PD) throughout the whole brain.
   METHODSTwelve PD patients and 18 age-matched controls were studied using neuropsychological testing, MRI and volumetric MR spectroscopic imaging. Average values of signal normalized metabolite values for N-acetyl-aspartate, total-creatine, and total-choline (NAA, total-Cre, total-Cho, respectively) and their ratios were calculated for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in each lobar brain region.
   RESULTSAnalyses revealed altered metabolite values in PD subjects relative to controls within the GM of the temporal lobe (right: elevated Cre, P = .027; decreased NAA/Cre, P = .019; decreased Cho/Cre, P = .001 and left: decreased NAA/Cre; P = .001, decreased Cho/Cre, P = .007); the right occipital lobe (decreased NAA, P = .032 and NAA/Cre, P = .016); and the total cerebrum GM (decreased NAA/Cre, P = .029). No meaningful correlations were obtained between abnormal metabolite values and the neuropsychological measures.
   CONCLUSIONSPD is associated with widespread alterations of brain metabolite concentrations, with a primary finding of increased creatine. Higher creatine values in our PD sample may reflect greater neuronal energy expenditure early in the disease process that is compensatory. This is the first whole brain MRS study of PD that has examined metabolite changes across a large fraction of the brain volume, including the cortical mantle.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSETemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with nontumoral amygdala enlargement (AE) has been reported to be a possible subtype of TLE without hippocampal sclerosis (HS). The purpose of this study was to clarify morphologic and functional characteristics of TLE with AE (TLE + AE).
   METHODSWe evaluated gray matter volume and cerebral glucose hypometabolism using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and voxel-based statistical analysis of [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images in 9 patients with TLE + AE as compared with controls. For VBM analysis, we recruited 30 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers as controls. For the comparison of FDG-PET analysis, 9 patients with definite mesial TLE with HS (MTLE + HS), and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited.
   RESULTSIn patients with TLE + AE, a significant increase in gray matter volume was found only in the affected amygdala, and no significant decrease in gray matter volume was detected. In addition, significant glucose hypometabolism was observed in the affected amygdala, whereas significant glucose hypometabolism in the hippocampus, a prominent feature of definite MTLE+HS, was not observed.
   CONCLUSIONSTLE + AE is different from MTLE + HS from morphologic and functional points of view, and the enlarged amygdala per se is potentially an epileptic focus in patients with partial epilepsy.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have suggested that structural changes do occur in the brain of patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy control participants. However, findings from such studies are inconclusive, probably because of the different methodologic approaches, the clinical heterogeneity of patient samples, and also the fact that patients enrolled were treated with antipsychotic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate brain GM volumes and intrinsic structural WM changes in first-contact, antipsychotic drug-naive patients with schizophrenia.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 43 first-contact, drug-naive, patients with schizophrenia and 17 age-matched control participants were studied. All participants underwent T1-weighted MR imaging and DTI scans. Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used to compare GM volumes and WM DTI metrics between groups. MR imaging measures were correlated with the duration of the untreated psychosis and the clinical positive and negative symptoms.
   RESULTS: Compared with control participants, patients with schizophrenia showed smaller volumes of the temporal, parietal, and occipital GM, and a pattern of decreased mean diffusivity and increased fractional anisotropy in the brain stem and cerebellum bilaterally, interhemispheric and cortico-cortical connections bilaterally, and right anterior and posterior limb of the internal capsule. In patients, decreased mean diffusivity and increased fractional anisotropy in several brain regions were related to a longer duration of the untreated psychosis and the severity of positive symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: First-contact, drug-naive, patients with schizophrenia present with volumetric and DTI changes, which correlated with their clinical features. This study increases our knowledge on the neural networks involved in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of schizophrenia.

   PATHOLOGY; LYMPHOMA; EYE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DWI has been increasingly used to characterize orbital masses and provides quantitative information in the form of the ADC, but studies of DWI of orbital masses have shown a range of reported sensitivities, specificities, and optimal threshold ADC values for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Our goal was to determine the optimal use of DWI for imaging orbital masses through aggregation of data from multiple centers.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Source data from 3 previous studies of orbital mass DWI were aggregated, and additional published data points were gathered. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and optimal ADC thresholds for distinguishing benign from malignant masses.
   RESULTS: There was no single ADC threshold that characterized orbital masses as benign or malignant with high sensitivity and specificity. An ADC of less than 0.93 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s was more than 90% specific for malignancy, and an ADC of less than 1.35 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s was more than 90% sensitive for malignancy. With these 2 thresholds, 33% of this cohort could be characterized as likely malignant, 29% as likely benign, and 38% as indeterminate.
   CONCLUSIONS: No single ADC threshold is highly sensitive and specific for characterizing orbital masses as benign or malignant. If we used 2 thresholds to divide these lesions into 3 categories, however, a majority of orbital masses can be characterized with >90% confidence.

TI Prediction of Pseudoprogression in Patients with Glioblastomas Using the
   Initial and Final Area Under the Curves Ratio Derived from Dynamic
   Contrast-Enhanced T1-Weighted Perfusion MR Imaging
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS; TUMOR RECURRENCE; DCE-MRI; NECROSIS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted perfusion MR imaging is much less susceptible to artifacts, and its high spatial resolution allows accurate characterization of the vascular microenvironment of the lesion. The purpose of this study was to test the predictive value of the initial and final area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging to differentiate pseudoprogression from early tumor progression in patients with glioblastomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients who showed new or enlarged, contrast-enhancing lesions within the radiation field after concurrent chemoradiotherapy were assessed by use of conventional and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging. The bimodal histogram parameters of the area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio, which included the mean area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio at a higher curve (mAUCR(H)), 3 cumulative histogram parameters (AUCR(50), AUCR(75), and AUCR(90)), and the area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio at mode (AUCR(mode)), were calculated and correlated with the final pathologic or clinical diagnosis. The best predictor for differentiation of pseudoprogression from early tumor progression was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.
   RESULTS: Seventy-nine study patients were subsequently classified as having pseudoprogression (n = 37, 46.8%) or early tumor progression (n = 42, 53.2%). There were statistically significant differences of mAUCR(H), AUCR(50), AUCR(75), AUCR(90), and AUCR(mode) between the 2 groups (P < .0001, each). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed the mAUCR(H) to be the best single predictor of pseudoprogression, with a sensitivity of 90.1% and a specificity of 82.9%. AUCR(50) was found to be the most specific predictor of pseudoprogression, with a sensitivity of 87.2% and a specificity of 83.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: A bimodal histogram analysis of the area under the time signal-intensity curves ratio derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging can be a potential, noninvasive imaging biomarker for monitoring early treatment response in patients with glioblastomas.

TI Spontaneous Delayed Migration/Shortening of the Pipeline Embolization
   Device: Report of 5 Cases
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID UNRUPTURED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; SINGLE-CENTER EXPERIENCE; PROXIMAL
   MIGRATION; ENTERPRISE STENT
AB Five patients were found to have spontaneous delayed migration/shortening of their Pipeline Embolization Devices on follow-up angiography. The device migrated proximally in 4 patients and distally in 1 patient. One patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and died as a result of migration of the Pipeline Embolization Device, and another patient presented with complete MCA occlusion and was left severely disabled. Mismatch in arterial diameter between inflow and outflow vessels was a constant finding. Migration of the Pipeline Embolization Device was managed conservatively, with additional placement of the device, or with parent vessel occlusion. Obtaining complete expansion of the embolization device by using a longer device, increasing vessel coverage, using adjunctive aneurysm coiling, and avoiding dragging and stretching of the device are important preventive measures. Neurointerventionalists should be aware of this potentially fatal complication and take all necessary preventive measures.

TI Reduction of Coil Mass Artifacts in High-Resolution Flat Detector

DT Article
ID CORRECTED PET IMAGES; BASILAR ARTERY; HIP IMPLANTS; FOLLOW-UP;
   ANEURYSMS; ALGORITHM; RECONSTRUCTION; SUPPRESSION; ARM; INTERPOLATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Developments in flat panel angiographic C-arm systems have enabled visualization of both the neurovascular stents and host arteries in great detail, providing complementary spatial information in addition to conventional DSA. However, the visibility of these structures may be impeded by artifacts generated by adjacent radio-attenuating objects. We report on the use of a metal artifact reduction algorithm for high-resolution contrast-enhanced conebeam CT for follow-up imaging of stent-assisted coil embolization.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Contrast-enhanced conebeam CT data were acquired in 25 patients who underwent stent-assisted coiling. Reconstructions were generated with and without metal artifact reduction and were reviewed by 3 experienced neuroradiologists by use of a 3-point scale.
   RESULTS: With metal artifact reduction, the observers agreed that the visibility had improved by at least 1 point on the scoring scale in >40% of the cases ( = 0.6) and that the streak artifact was not obscuring surrounding structures in 64% of all cases ( = 0.6). Metal artifact reduction improved the image quality, which allowed for visibility sufficient for evaluation in 65% of the cases, and was preferred over no metal artifact reduction in 92% ( = 0.9). Significantly higher scores were given with metal artifact reduction (P < .0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although metal artifact reduction is not capable of fully removing artifacts caused by implants with high x-ray absorption, we have shown that the image quality of contrast-enhanced conebeam CT data are improved drastically. The impact of the artifacts on the visibility varied between cases, and yet the overall visibility of the contrast-enhanced conebeam CT with metal artifact reduction improved in most the cases.

   EFFICACY; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Five commercial devices are available for mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. This study evaluated and compared the resultant arterial damage from these devices.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wall damage after 4 wall-contact devices (the Merci retriever, Catch thromboembolectomy system, and Solitaire FR revascularization devices of 4 and 6 mm) and 1 aspiration device (the Penumbra System) was evaluated in the superficial femoral arteries of 20 male swine. Each device was tested with and without intraluminal clot. Twenty control vessels were not subjected to any intervention. Acute histopathologic changes were evaluated.
   RESULTS: In the device samples, endothelial denudation (72.8 29.4% versus 0.9 +/- 1.9%, P < .0001), medial layer edema (52 +/- 35.9% versus 18.1 +/- 27.8%, P = .004), and mural thrombus (5.3 +/- 14.2% versus 0%, P = .05) were found to a greater extent compared with the control samples. The aspiration device provoked more intimal layer (100 +/- 79.1% versus 58.8 +/- 48.9%, P = .27) and medial layer (75 +/- 35.4% versus 46.3 +/- 34.8%, P = .13) edema than the wall-contact devices.
   CONCLUSIONS: All devices caused vascular injuries extending into the medial layer. The aspiration device was associated with more intimal and medial layer edema, compared with the wall-contact devices except for the Catch thromboembolectomy system.

AB Solitaire AB stent-assisted coiling facilitates the endovascular treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. Solitaire Aneurysm Remodeling is the first prospective, consecutive, European multicentric study whose main objective was to evaluate the safety, short-, and long-term efficacy of the Solitaire AB stent. This first analysis is focused on the short-term results.
   After exclusion of one patient, 66 Solitaire AB stents were used to treat via endovascular approach 64 aneurysms (63 patients) in seven European centers. Technical and clinical complications were recorded. A core laboratory evaluated the angiographic efficacy by using the Raymond classification scale.
   The mean width of aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Complete occlusion was achieved in 27 aneurysms (42.2 %); neck remnant was seen in 25 aneurysms (39.1 %) and aneurysm remnant in 12 aneurysms (18.7 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure were encountered in eight patients (12.7 %). Postprocedural modification of the clinical status was observed in one patient (1.6 %). No patients died (0 %); one had a permanent deficit (1.6 %), and one had a transient deficit (1.6 %). Treatment-related mortality was 0 %, and permanent morbidity was 1.6 %.
   The Solitaire AB stent has an excellent rate of technical success navigation with the absence of dislodgement. The safety and short-term efficacy are comparable to those previously reported with coiling alone. Mid- and long-term follow-up will be required to elucidate the impact of the Solitaire AB stent on recanalization rate.

TI 4D Digital Subtraction Angiography: Implementation and Demonstration of
   Feasibility
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPUTERIZED FLUOROSCOPY; SYSTEM; DETECTOR; SCANNER; TIME
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional 3D-DSA volumes are reconstructed from a series of projections containing temporal information. It was our purpose to develop a technique which would generate fully time-resolved 3D-DSA vascular volumes having better spatial and temporal resolution than that which is available with CT or MR angiography.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a single contrast injection, projections from the mask and fill rotation are subtracted to create a series of vascular projections. With the use of these projections, a conventional conebeam CT reconstruction is generated (conventional 3D-DSA). This is used to constrain the reconstruction of individual 3D temporal volumes, which incorporate temporal information from the acquired projections (4D-DSA).
   RESULTS: Typically, 30 temporal volumes per second are generated with the use of currently available flat detector systems, a factor of similar to 200 increase over that achievable with the use of multiple gantry rotations. Dynamic displays of the reconstructed volumes are viewable from any angle. Good results have been obtained by using both intra-arterial and intravenous injections.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to generate time-resolved 3D-DSA vascular volumes with the use of commercially available flat detector angiographic systems and clinically practical injection protocols. The spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the time frames are largely determined by that of the conventional 3D-DSA constraining image and not by that of the projections used to generate the 3D reconstruction. The spatial resolution and temporal resolution exceed that of CTA and MRA, and the small vessel contrast is increased relative to that of conventional 2D-DSA due to the use of maximum intensity projections.

TI Intracranial 4D Flow MRI: Toward Individualized Assessment of
   Arteriovenous Malformation Hemodynamics and Treatment-Induced Changes

   TIME
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Arteriovenous malformations are an important etiology of hemorrhagic stroke. However, current imaging modalities and risk do not provide insights into individual AVM hemodynamics and its role in pathophysiology. The aims of this study are to determine whether intracranial 4D flow MR imaging can provide insights into arteriovenous malformation hemodynamics independent of the Spetzler-Martin grade and to report the changes in flow observed during staged embolization.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracranial 3D blood flow was assessed in 20 patients with AVM (age = 39 +/- 15 years, Spetzler-Martin grade ranging from 1-4) with the use of 4D flow MR imaging (temporal resolution = 45 ms, spatial resolution = [1.2-1.6mm](3)). AVM hemodynamics were visualized by means of time-integrated 3D pathlines depicting the AVM arterial feeding and venous draining patterns over the cardiac cycle. Analysis included the grading of feeding and draining velocities on a 3-point scale (0 = low <25 cm/s, 1 = medium <50 cm/s, 2 = high >50 cm/s). For 4 of 20 patients undergoing 4D flow MR imaging follow-up after staged embolization, peak velocities were quantified in arterial feeders, draining veins, the sagittal sinus, and contralateral arteries.
   RESULTS: In 50% of the cases with Spetzler-Martin grade >2, heterogeneous flow (velocity grade differences >1) was found across arteries and veins. Velocities in draining veins increased from Spetzler-Martin grade = 1 (grading = 0.5 +/- 0.6) to Spetzler-Martin grade >= 3 (1.1 +/- 0.6), whereas arterial velocities were similar (1.7 +/- 0.6 versus 1.5 +/- 0.6). In the postembolization subgroup of 4 patients, 4D flow MR imaging demonstrated successively more compact AVM and redistribution of velocities. Changes in arterial and venous velocities during treatment were highly different among individuals.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spetzler-Martin grade does not reflect differences in 3D AVM arterial and venous hemodynamics, and an individual assessment of AVM hemodynamics may be needed for improved lesion characterization. Four-dimensional flow MR imaging may have the potential to monitor and guide embolization treatment planning.

   VALIDITY; BATTERY; IMAGES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MRIs are obtained in research in healthy and clinical populations, and incidental findings have been reported. Most studies have examined adults with variability in parameters of image acquisition and clinical measures available. We conducted a prospective study of youths and documented the frequency and concomitants of incidental findings.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Youths (n = 1400) with an age range from 8-23 years were imaged on the same 3T scanner, with a standard acquisition protocol providing 1.0 mm(3) isotropic resolution of anatomic scans. All scans were reviewed by an experienced board-certified neuroradiologist and were categorized into 3 groups: 1) normal: no incidental findings; 2) coincidental: incidental finding(s) were noted, further reviewed with an experienced pediatric neuroradiologist, but were of no clinical significance; 3) incidental findings that on further review were considered to have potential clinical significance and participants were referred for appropriate clinical follow-up.
   RESULTS: Overall, 148 incidental findings (10.6% of sample) were noted, and of these, 12 required clinical follow-up. Incidental findings were not related to age. However, whites had a higher incidence of pineal cysts, and males had a higher incidence of cavum septum pellucidum, which was associated with psychosis-related symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Incidental findings, moderated by race and sex, occur in approximately one-tenth of participants volunteering for pediatric research, with few requiring follow-up. The incidence supports a 2-tiered approach of neuroradiologic reading and clinical input to determine the potential significance of incidental findings detected on research MR imaging scans.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pathologic changes in GM have an important role in MS. We investigated the association between SDGM and cortical volume changes and disability progression in early RRMS.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty patients with RRMS had clinical assessment during 5 years and were divided into those with or without SDP at 5 years by the usual definition in treatment trials. The number of available MR imaging scans at various time points was the following: at baseline, 178; and at 6 months, 172; at 12 months, 175; at 24 months, 155; at 36 months, 160; at 48 months, 158; and at 60 months, 162, respectively. Longitudinal changes in cortical, GM, and WM volume were calculated by using the direct method.
   RESULTS: At 5 years, 90 patients with RRMS experienced SDP and 90 had stable disease. At baseline, patients with SDP had longer disease duration, greater T2-lesion volume, and smaller whole-brain, WM, cortical, and SDGM volume (P < .01). At 5 years, patients with SDP had significantly greater percentage decreases from baseline compared with those without SDP in the volume of the whole brain (P < .0001), cortex (P = .001), GM (P = .003), and thalamus (P = .01). In patients who developed SDP at 5 years and those who did not, mixed-effect models, adjusted for age, disease duration, and change of the treatment status, showed significant interactions between SDP status at 5 years and changes with time in whole-brain, cortical, lateral ventricle (all P < .001), thalamus (P = .006), and total SDGM (P = .0095) volume.
   CONCLUSIONS: SDP is associated with progression of cortical, central, and thalamic atrophy in early RRMS during 5 years.

   SATURATION; RESONANCE; PROTEINS; FIELD; PEPTIDES; AGENTS; RF
AB Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indirectly images exchangeable solute protons resonating at frequencies different than bulk water. These solute protons are selectively saturated using low bandwidth RF irradiation and saturation is transferred to bulk water protons via chemical exchange, resulting in an attenuation of the measured water proton signal. CEST MRI is an advanced MRI technique with wide application potential due to the ability to examine complex molecular contributions. CEST MRI at high field (7 Tesla [7 T]) will improve the overall results due to increase in signal, T-1 relaxation time, and chemical shift dispersion. Increased field strength translates to enhanced quantification of the metabolite of interest, allowing more fundamental studies on underlying pathophysiology. CEST contrast is affected by several tissue properties, such as the concentrations of exchange partners and their rate of proton exchange, whose effects have been examined and explored in this review. We have highlighted the background of CEST MRI, typical implementation strategy, and complications at 7 T.

DE Optic nerve sheath diameter; optic disc elevation; Idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension
ID SHEATH
AB OBJECTIVESTo report values of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and optic disc elevation (ODE) obtained with optic nerve sonography (US) in the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment efficacy in an adult with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
   METHODSSerial measurements of the ONSD and ODE using B mode US were performed in a 45-years-old woman with IIH before and during after treatment with acetazolamide and diet.
   RESULTSAt first evaluation US showed a significantly enlarged ONSD (.68 cm right; .66 cm left side) and the presence of increased ODE (.1 cm right; .15 cm left side). Post-punctural assessments showed a bilateral decrease of ONSD (.58 cm right; .58 cm left side), without changes in ODE values. After 12 months of treatment with acetazolamide and diet ODE completely normalized (0 cm on both sides). ODE values correlated directly with ONSD, and both ODE and ONSD values correlated directly with BMI. Correlations were statistically significant. ONSD changes occurred rapidly after the lumbar puncture, whereas the papilloedema required longer to reduce.
   CONCLUSIONSUS of ONSD and ODE was useful to support the diagnosis of IIH and to monitor the efficacy of diet and pharmacological treatment. Further studies are required to evaluate whether this promising technique may be considered a reliable and accurate method to longitudinally evaluate patients with increased ICP secondary to IIH.

TI Coil Embolization versus Clipping for Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms: A
   Meta-Analysis of Prospective Controlled Published Studies
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENDOVASCULAR COILING; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; TRIAL; OUTCOMES; LIGATION;
   ISAT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coil embolization is an alternative to clipping for intracranial aneurysms. However, controversy exists regarding the best therapeutic strategy in patients with ruptured aneurysms, and there is great center- and country-related variability in the rates of clipping versus coiling. We performed a meta-analysis of prospective controlled trials of clipping versus coil embolization for ruptured aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a search of the English literature for published prospective controlled trials comparing surgical clipping with endovascular coil embolization for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Data were abstracted from the identified references. Outcomes of interest were the proportion of patients with a poor outcome at 1 year and episodes of rebleeding from the index treated aneurysm after the allocated treatment.
   RESULTS: There were 3 prospective controlled trials eligible for inclusion. These studies enrolled 2723 patients. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that the rate of poor outcome at 1 year was significantly lower in patients allocated to coil embolization (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.87). This relative effect is consistent with an absolute risk reduction of 7.8% and a number needed to treat of 13. The effect on mortality was not statistically different across the 2 treatments. Rebleeding rates within the first month were higher in patients allocated to endovascular coil embolization.
   CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the analysis of the 3 high-quality prospective controlled trials available, there is strong evidence to indicate that endovascular coil embolization is associated with better outcomes compared with surgical clipping in patients amenable to either therapeutic strategy.

TI Incidental Thyroid Nodules on CT: Evaluation of 2 Risk-Categorization
   Methods for Work-Up of Nodules
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CANCER; MANAGEMENT; PAPILLARY; CHILDREN; SEX; AGE; US
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thyroid nodules are common incidental findings on CT, but there are no clear guidelines regarding their further diagnostic work-up. This study compares the performance of 2 risk-categorization methods of selecting CT-detected incidental thyroid nodules for work-up.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 2 categorization methods were method A, based on nodule size 10 mm, and method B, a 3-tiered system based on aggressive imaging features, patient age younger than 35 years or nodule size of 15 mm. In part 1, the 2 categorization methods were applied to thyroid cancers in the SEER data base of the National Cancer Institute to compare the cancer capture rates and survival. In part two, 755 CT neck scans at our institution were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of ITNs of 5 mm, and the same 2 categorization methods were applied to the CT cases to compare the number of patients who would theoretically meet the criteria for work-up. Comparisons of proportions of subjects captured under methods A and B were made by using the McNemar test.
   RESULTS: For 84,720 subjects in the SEER data base, methods A and B each captured 74% (62,708/84,720 and 62,586/84,720, respectively) of malignancies. SEER subjects who would not have met the criteria for further work-up by both methods had equally excellent 10-year cause-specific and relative survival of >99%. For part 2, the prevalence of ITNs of 5 mm at our institution was 133/755 (18%). The number of ITNs that would be recommended for work-up by method A was 57/133 (43%) compared with 31/133 (23%) for method B (P < .0005).
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with using a 10-mm cutoff, the 3-tiered risk-stratification method identified fewer ITNs for work-up but captured the same proportion of cancers in a national data base and showed no difference in missing high-mortality cancers.

ID GAUSSIAN WATER DIFFUSION; CERVICAL CORD; TENSOR MRI; IN-VIVO; MATTER
   DEMYELINATION; AXONAL LOSS; MS PATIENTS; POSTMORTEM; ATROPHY; LESIONS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The spinal cord is a site of predilection for MS lesions. While diffusion tensor imaging is useful for the study of anisotropic systems such as WM tracts, it is of more limited utility in tissues with more isotropic microstructures (on the length scales studied with diffusion MR imaging) such as gray matter. In contrast, diffusional kurtosis imaging, which measures both Gaussian and non-Gaussian properties of water diffusion, provides more biomarkers of both anisotropic and isotropic structural changes. The aim of this study was to investigate the cervical spinal cord of patients with MS and to characterize lesional and normal-appearing gray matter and WM damage by using diffusional kurtosis imaging.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients (13 women, mean age = 41.1 10.7 years) and 16 controls (7 women, mean age = 35.6 11.2-years) underwent MR imaging of the cervical spinal cord on a 3T scanner (T2 TSE, T1 magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo, diffusional kurtosis imaging, T2 fast low-angle shot). Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and mean kurtosis were measured on the whole cord and in normal-appearing gray matter and WM.
   RESULTS: Spinal cord T2-hyperintense lesions were identified in 18 patients. Whole spinal cord fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis (P = .0009, P = .003), WM fractional anisotropy (P = .01), and gray matter mean kurtosis (P = .006) were significantly decreased, and whole spinal cord mean diffusivity (P = .009) was increased in patients compared with controls. Mean spinal cord area was significantly lower in patients (P = .04).
   CONCLUSIONS: Diffusional kurtosis imaging of the spinal cord can provide a more comprehensive characterization of lesions and normal-appearing WM and gray matter damage in patients with MS. Diffusional kurtosis imaging can provide additional and complementary information to DTI on spinal cord pathology.

   THROMBECTOMY; REPORTING STANDARDS; ARTERIAL OCCLUSIONS
AB BACKGROUND: In 2003, Higashida et al proposed the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction scale to evaluate angiographic intracranial flow. Our aim is to review how subsequently published studies define TICI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the ISI Web of Knowledge and SciVerse Scopus databases to search for TICI and thrombolysis in cerebral infarction and for articles that cited the original TICI paper from January 2004 through May 2012. Articles were categorized according to their definition of the TICI categories, typically grades 0-4, with grade 2 (partial reperfusion) subdivided into 2a and 2b, and rate of contrast entry to the perfused area. In addition, we catalogued the type of redefinitions of TICI subcategory 2 and additions of new categories.
   RESULTS: Of 236 articles screened, 74 were included. Eight (11%) explicitly followed the TICI scale as originally defined. Thirty-seven (50%) cited Higashida but did not define their scale. Fifteen (21%) used and explained modified scales. Thirteen (18%) used the term TICI, but did not define the scale and did not cite Higashida. Eighteen (24%) specified a 2a subcategory. Nine defined grade 2a as <67% filling, 6 defined it as <50%, and 3 did not offer a percentage. Two studies added a 2c subcategory. Fifty-two (70%) used a cutoff level to define successful reperfusion. Of these, 65% used TICI 2, 33% used TICI 2b, and 2% used TICI = 3.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variability in the definition and/or application of the TICI scale in the literature. This variability could considerably impact our understanding of results of revascularization studies.

AB Resting state networks are proposed to reflect the neuronal connectivity that underlies cognitive processes. Consequently, abnormal behaviour of these networks due to disease or altered development may predict poor cognitive outcome. To understand how very preterm birth may affect the development of resting state connectivity, we followed a cohort of very preterm-born infants from birth through to 4 years of age using resting state functional MRI.
   From a larger longitudinal cohort of infants born very preterm (< 32 weeks gestational age), 36 at birth, 30 at term, 21 two-year and 22 four-year resting state fMRI datasets were acquired. Using seed-based connectivity analyses with seeds in the anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, left and right motor-hand regions and left and right temporal lobes, we investigated local and inter-region connectivity as a function of group and age.
   We found strong local connectivity during the preterm period, which matured into inter-hemispheric and preliminary default-mode network correlations by 4 years of age. This development is comparable to the resting state networks found in term-born infants of equivalent age.
   The results of this study suggest that differences in developmental trajectory between preterm-born and term-born infants are small and, if present, would require a large sample from both populations to be detected.

AB Direct correlation between neuropathological findings and postmortem neuromelanin MR imaging (NmMRI) was performed in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to clarify the pathological background of the signal changes in normal, Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) cases.
   NmMRI of 10 % formalin-fixed autopsied midbrains was performed in three cases (normal control, DLB, and PD) with a 3T imaging system, using a 3D gradient echo T1-weighted sequence with a magnetization transfer contrast pulse. Neuropathological examinations of the midbrains were performed, and the density of neuromelanin-positive neurons (number per square millimeter) was determined. The extent of iron deposition in the midbrain was also evaluated using ferritin immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we directly correlated the contrast signal ratio in the SNc and the density of neuromelanin-containing neurons.
   Diffuse hyperintense areas in the SNc reflected well-preserved neuromelanin-containing neurons in the normal control case, whereas an iso-intense area in the SNc showed severe loss of neuromelanin-containing neurons in the DLB and PD cases. Increased signal intensity in the SNc was apparently not influenced by iron deposition. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between signal intensity and the density of neuromelanin-containing neurons was seen in the SNc.
   Based on the direct correlation between postportem NmMRI and neuropathological findings, signal intensity in the SNc is closely related to the quantity of neuromelanin-containing neurons but is not influenced by iron deposition.

AB The goals of this study were to examine the usefulness of diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) for assessing microstructural changes in the compressed corticospinal tract (CST) among patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).
   Eleven patients with iNPH (mean age: 73.6 years, range: 65-84), who underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging, including DKI before surgery, were recruited. Six age-matched, healthy subjects (mean age: 69.8 years, range: 60-75) served as the control group. DKI and diffusion tensor imaging parameters were calculated and compared between the iNPH and the control groups using tract-specific analysis of the CST at the level of the lateral ventricle.
   Mean diffusional kurtosis (DK) and axial diffusion kurtosis were significantly lower in iNPH patients. However, apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, and axial eigenvalue (lambda (1) ) were significantly higher in the iNPH group than in the control group.
   The mechanical pressure caused by ventricular enlargement in iNPH patients might induce formation of well-aligned fiber tracts and increased fiber density in the CST, resulting in decreased DK. DKI is able to depict both the altered microstructure and water molecule movement within neural axons and intra- or extracellular space. In addition, the investigated DKI parameters provide different information about white matter relative to conventional diffusional metrics for iNPH.

AB PURPOSE To determine regional alterations of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-negative temporal lobe epilepsy with unknown cause (TLEu) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based statistics (VBS).
   METHODS Ten patients with left TLEu and no abnormality on conventional MRI and 81 age-matched neurological healthy controls were studied. VBS analyses were used to compare FA and MD differences between patients and controls. All results were reported using stringent statistical thresholds corrected for multiple comparisons.
   RESULTS Patients with TLEu had widespread and bilateral reduction of white matter FA, encompassing the temporal lobes, entire corpus callosum, thalamus, and other regions relative to controls. Increased MD was more spatially limited in patients, but was also observed in the thalamus. FA of the putamen was significantly increased bilaterally in patients relative to controls, which correlated with increasing macroscopic atrophy of the putamen.
   DISCUSSION Water diffusion abnormalities are widespread and bilaterally distributed in patients with unilateral TLEu, which are beyond the resolution of conventional MRI. FA alterations are more widespread relative to MD alterations. This is the first study to show evidence of interrelated microscopic (ie, FA increase) and macroscopic (ie, atrophy) alterations of the putamen in patients with TLEu.

ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; MRI
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEDistal hyperintense vessels (DHV) on MRI FLAIR sequences in acute brain ischemia are thought to represent leptomeningeal collateral flow. We hypothesized that DHV are more common in acute stroke patients with perfusion-diffusion weighted mismatch (PDM) than in those without.
   METHODSWe performed a retrospective study of consecutive anterior circulation stroke patients who underwent multimodal MRI within 8 hours of onset. We correlated DHV occurrence with the presence or absence of PDM, and analyzed DHV correlates when angiography was available.
   RESULTSTwenty-one patients with PDM and 28 without were included. On univariate analysis, there was no significant difference regarding demographic variables between the two groups, with the exception of a higher frequency of atrial fibrillation (33% vs. 7%; P= .02) and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator use (57% vs 25%; P= .03) in the PDM patients. The PDM group more commonly had DHV (85% vs 25%; P < .001). On multivariate analysis, DHV presence (odds ratio, 6.01; 95% confidence-interval, 1.08-33.29; P= .04) and vessel occlusion site (odds ratio, 3.17; 95% confidence-interval, 1.21-8.31; P= .01) were the only variables independently associated with PDM. Conventional angiography was useful correlating DHV presence and collateral flow in a subset of patients.
   CONCLUSIONSDHV may be a surrogate marker for PDM in patients with hyperacute ischemic stroke.

DE Basilar artery aneurysm; basilar fenestration; stent-assisted coiling;
   double barrel
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Basilar artery fenestration aneurysms are rare aneurysms, posing unique challenges for endovascular treatment. We report a case of successful treatment of a wide-necked basilar artery fenestration aneurysm with a novel double-barrel stent-assisted coiling technique.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION
   A 50-year-old woman presented with headaches. Evaluation revealed an unruptured 7-mm broad-based basilar artery fenestration aneurysm that incorporated both limbs of the basilar fenestration and both distal vertebral arteries.
   INTERVENTION
   A 4.5 mm x 22 mm Enterprise stent (Codman Neurovascular, Raynham, MA, USA) was deployed from the right limb of the basilar fenestration into the right distal vertebral artery. Similarly, a 2.5 mm x 20 mm Neuroform EZ stent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was placed from the left limb of the basilar fenestration into the left distal vertebral artery. Following stent deployment, the aneurysm was treated with coil-embolization through a jailed microcatheter.
   CONCLUSION
   In the case presented, a double-barrel stent configuration enabled dense coil embolization of the aneurysm as well as preservation of both basilar fenestration limbs and both distal vertebral arteries.

AB Flat-panel angiographic CT after intravenous contrast agent application (ivACT) is increasingly used as a follow-up examination after coiling, clipping, or stenting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a new metal artefact reduction algorithm (MARA) in patients treated for intracranial aneurysms and stenosis.
   IvACT was performed on a flat-panel detector angiography system after intravenous application of 80 ml contrast media. The uncorrected raw images were transferred to a prototype reconstruction workstation where the MARA was applied. Two experienced neuroradiologists examined the corrected and uncorrected images on a commercially available workstation.
   Artefacts around the implants were detected in all 16 uncorrected cases, while eight cases showed remaining artefacts after correction with the MARA. In the cases without correction, there were 11 cases with "extensive" artefacts and five cases with "many" artefacts. After correction, seven cases showed "few" and only one case "many" artefacts (Wilcoxon test, P < 0.001). Parent vessels were characterized as "not identifiable" in 62 % of uncorrected images, while the delineation of parent vessels were classified as "excellent" in 50 % of the cases after correction (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.001).
   Use of the MARA in our study significantly reduced artefacts around metallic implants on ivACT images and allowed for the delineation of surrounding structures.

AB PURPOSETo assess the involvement of basal ganglia and thalamus in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method.
   METHODSFourteen definite-ALS patients and 12 age-matched controls underwent whole brain DTI on a 3T scanner. Mean-diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were obtained bilaterally from the basal ganglia and thalamus in the regions-of-interest (ROIs).
   RESULTSThe MD was significantly higher (P<.02) in basal ganglia and thalamus in patients with ALS compared with controls. Correspondingly, the FA was significantly lower (P<.02) in these structures, except in caudate (P=.04) and putamen (P=.06) in patients compared with controls. There were mild to strong correlations (r=.3-.7) between the DTI measures of basal ganglia and finger-tap, foot-tap, and lip-and-tongue movement rate.
   CONCLUSIONSThe increased MD in basal ganglia and thalamus and decreased FA in globus pallidus and thalamus are indicative of neuronal loss or dysfunction in these structures.

AB We investigated the efficacy of three-dimensional black blood T1-weighted imaging (3D-BB-T1WI) using a variable refocusing flip angle turbo spin-echo sequence in the diagnosis of intracranial vertebral artery dissection (VAD).
   Sixteen consecutive patients diagnosed with intracranial VAD underwent magnetic resonance imaging that included 3D time-of-flight-MRA, axial spin-echo T1-weighted images (SE-T1WI) and oblique coronal 3D-BB-T1WI sequences. The visualization, morphology and extent of intramural haematomas were assessed and compared among the sequences. Results obtained by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), 3D-angiography and/or 3D-CT angiography (CTA) were used as standards of reference.
   3D-BB-T1WI revealed intramural haematomas in all cases, whereas SE-T1WI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) failed to reveal a haematoma in one case and three cases, respectively. The mean visualization grading score for the intramural haematoma was the highest for 3D-BB-T1WI, and there was a statistically significant difference among the sequences (p < 0.001). At least a portion of the intramural haematoma was distinguishable from the lumen on 3D-BB-T1WI, whereas the haematomas were entirely indistinguishable from intraluminal signals on MRA in two cases (12.5 %) and on SE-T1WI in one case (6.3 %). 3D-BB-T1WI revealed the characteristic crescent shape of the intramural haematoma in 14 cases (87.5 %), whereas SE-T1WI and MRA revealed a crescent shape in only 7 cases (43.8 %) and 8 cases (50 %), respectively. In a consensus reading, 3D-BB-T1WI was considered the most consistent sequence in representing the extent and morphology of the lesion in 14 cases (87.5 %), compared to DSA and CTA.
   3D-BB-T1WI is a promising method to evaluate intramural haematoma in patients with suspected intracranial VAD.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contrast leakage results in underestimation of the CBV of brain tumors. Our aim was to compare the diagnostic performance of DSC perfusion MR imaging without and with mathematic contrast-leakage correction in differentiating PCNSLs and glioblastomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Perfusion parametersCBV, corrected CBV, and leakage coefficientwere measured in enhancing tumor portions and contralateral NAWM of 15 PCNSLs and 20 glioblastomas, respectively. The ratios of CBV and corrected CBV were calculated by dividing the tumor values by those obtained from contralateral NAWM. A paired t test was used to compare tumor K-2 and NAWM K-2, as well as tumor CBV ratios without and with leakage correction. Comparisons of CBV, corrected CBV, and K-2 between PCNSLs and glioblastomas were done by using a 2-sample t test. The diagnostic performance of DSC perfusion MR imaging without and with contrast-leakage correction was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
   RESULTS: PCNSLs and glioblastomas demonstrated higher K-2 than those in their contralateral NAWM. Corrected CBV ratios were significantly higher than the uncorrected ones for both tumors. PCNSLs had lower CBV ratios (P < .001), lower corrected CBV ratios (P < .001), and higher K-2 (P = .001) compared with glioblastomas. In differentiating between PCNSLs and glioblastomas, the area under the curve of the CBV ratio, corrected CBV ratio, and K-2 were 0.984, 0.940, and 0.788, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: PCNSL can be differentiated from glioblastoma with CBV ratios, corrected CBV ratios, and K-2. CBV without contrast-leakage correction seems to have the best diagnostic performance in differentiating the 2 tumors.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular embolization of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms can be technically challenging, especially when the anatomy is complex. Stent reconstruction of the parent artery is commonly used to treat wide-neck and bifurcated aneurysms. The main objective of this study was to investigate the periprocedural and midterm morbidity and mortality results of this procedure.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: SENAT is a consecutive, prospective, multicentric study. Patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment with the Neuroform stent system were recruited and recorded. Technical outcomes and complications were also assessed. The midterm anatomic results were re-evaluated at 12-18 months.
   RESULTS: A total of 113 stents were used to treat the 107 aneurysms in 107 patients. The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 6.2 mm, and the mean diameter of aneurysm neck was 4.5 mm. The complete occlusion rate postprocedure was 66.4%. The rate of progressive occlusion at 12-18 months was 14%, and the rate of recurrence was 9.7%. The rate of subsequent treatment was 4%. The thromboembolic rate in the periprocedural period was 3.7%, and the rate of delayed TE events was 3%. Overall, the mortality rate at 12-18 months was 1%, and the permanent morbidity rate was 1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coiling with the Neuroform stent system provides a high level of occlusion with low rates of subsequent treatment despite a predominant population of patients with wide-neck aneurysms. Morbidity and thromboembolic rates were comparable to studies investigating stand-alone coiling.

   Injuries: A Safe and Effective Treatment Option
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

DT Article
ID BLUNT CEREBROVASCULAR INJURIES; DISSECTION; DIAGNOSIS; OUTCOMES; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The appropriate choice of treatment for traumatic extracranial carotid artery injury is still debated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of endovascular carotid repair with regard to vessel patency and retreatment rates.
   METHODS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent endovascular treatment for acute traumatic internal carotid artery dissection with or without pseudoaneurysm formation. The Biffl classification of blunt carotid arterial injuries with an additional modification to stratify grade 2 and 3 injuries into no-flow-limiting (2a/3a) and flow-limiting (2b/3b) was used to classify injuries.
   RESULTS: Forty-seven patients underwent 50 endovascular interventions. Forty-four were treated with stents alone, 4 required both stent and coil treatments, and 2 were treated with coils alone. Initial treatment resulted in complete restoration of the normal vessel lumen diameter in 25 (50%) treated vessels and good-to-acceptable restoration in 25 (50%) vessels. A single patient had complete stent occlusion. Three patients required stent and/or coil retreatment. There was no mortality or permanent morbidity relating to endovascular carotid artery repair. Twenty-one patients initially treated with medical management ultimately required endovascular treatment. Eighteen (87.5%) of these injuries were initially classified as grade 3a and 3 (14.3%) were initially grade 2a. Injury progression necessitating treatment was identified, on average, within 5 weeks of the initial injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our series, endovascular therapy was a safe and effective option for restoring luminal caliber and eliminating flow within pseudoaneurysms related to traumatic injuries. Imaging follow-up of all cervicocerebral vascular injuries is especially important within the first 45 days, a critical interval during which most lesions demonstrate healing or progression.

AB Flow diverting devices and stents can be used to treat cerebral aneurysms too difficult to treat with coiling or craniotomy and clipping. However, the hemodynamic effects of these devices have not been studied in depth. The objective of this study was to quantify and understand the fluid dynamic changes that occur within bifurcating aneurysms when treated with different devices and configurations.
   Two physical models of bifurcating cerebral aneurysms were constructed: an idealized model and a patient-specific model. The models were treated with four device configurations: a single low-porosity Pipeline embolization device (PED) and one, two, and three high-porosity Enterprise stents deployed in a telescoping fashion. Particle image velocimetry was used to measure the fluid dynamics within the aneurysms; pressure was measured within the patient-specific model.
   The PED resulted in the greatest reductions in fluid dynamic activity within the aneurysm for both models. However, a configuration of three telescoping stents reduced the fluid dynamic activity within the aneurysm similarly to the PED treatment. Pressure within the patient-specific aneurysm did not show significant changes among the treatment configurations; however, the pressure difference across the untreated vessel side of the model was greatest with the PED.
   Treatment with stents and a flow diverter led to reductions in aneurysmal fluid dynamic activity for both idealized and patient-specific models. While the PED resulted in the greatest flow reductions, telescoping high-porosity stents performed similarly and may represent a viable treatment alternative in situations where the use of a PED is not an option.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies have assessed PET by using various tracers to diagnose disease recurrence in patients with previously treated glioma; however, the accuracy of these methods, particularly compared with alternative imaging modalities, remains unclear. Weconducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the diagnostic accuracy of PET and compare it with alternative imaging modalities.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus (until June 2011), bibliographies, and review articles. Two reviewers extracted study characteristics, validity items, and quantitative data on diagnostic accuracy. Weperformed meta-analysis when >= 5 studies were available.
   RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were eligible. Studies were heterogeneous in treatment strategies and diagnostic criteria of PET; recurrence was typically suspected by CT or MR imaging. The diagnostic accuracies of F-18-FDG (n = 16) and C-11-MET PET (n = 7) were heterogeneous across studies. F-18-FDG PET had a summary sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.85) and specificity of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-0.91) for any glioma histology; C-11-methionine PET had a summary sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.50-0.84) and specificity of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.44-1.0) for high-grade glioma. These estimates were stable in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Data were limited on F-18-FET (n = 4), F-18-FLT (n = 2), and F-18-boronophenylalanine (n = 1). Few studies performed direct comparisons between different PET tracers or between PET and other imaging modalities.
   CONCLUSIONS: F-18-FDG and C-11-MET PET appear to have moderately good accuracy as add-on tests for diagnosing recurrent glioma suspected by CT or MR imaging. Studies comparing alternative tracers or PET versus other imaging modalities are scarce. Prospective studies performing head-to-head comparisons between alternative imaging modalities are needed.

   MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; OLDER
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient age substantially influences treatment decisions for ruptured cerebral aneurysms. It would be useful to understand national age-related trends of treatment techniques and outcomes in patients treated for ruptured cerebral aneurysm in the United States.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we evaluated trends in treatment technique (clipping versus coiling) and discharge status of patients undergoing clipping or coiling of ruptured cerebral aneurysms between 2001 and 2009. Outcomes were evaluated in relation to 4 age strata: 1) younger than 50 years of age, 2) 50-64 years of age, 3) 65-79 years of age, and 4) patients 80 years or older. We compared outcomes between treatment groups for patients treated between 2001-2004 with those treated between 2005-2009.
   RESULTS: A significant increase in the proportion of patients undergoing endovascular coiling between 2001 and 2009 was noted for all age groups (P < .0001). For both clipped and coiled patients, mortality and the proportion of patients discharged to long-term facilities increased with age. Overall mortality for patients clipped and coiled decreased modestly for all age groups, and overall proportions of patients discharged home increased modestly (P < .01) for all age groups except those older than 80 years of age.
   CONCLUSIONS: Between 2001 and 2009, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of patients with ruptured aneurysms undergoing endovascular coiling rather than aneurysm clipping. This increase was more pronounced in older patients. Mortality from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage decreased during the past decade, regardless of aneurysm treatment technique.

   THROMBECTOMY; INTRAVENOUS THROMBOLYSIS; ANTERIOR CIRCULATION;
   RECANALIZATION; DEVICE; TRIAL; INTRAARTERIAL; STREPTOKINASE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute vertebrobasilar occlusion is an ominous disease with few proved effective treatments. Experience with stent retrievers is scarce and limited to combined therapies (stent retrievers associated with previous intravenous fibrinolysis, intra-arterial thrombolysis, or other mechanical devices). We present our experience with 18 patients treated with direct thrombectomy by using stent retrievers.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with vertebrobasilar occlusion were treated with direct thrombectomy by using stent retrievers at our hospital. The mean age was 67.5 years. Clinical presentation was sudden deterioration in consciousness level in 61.2% and progressive or fluctuating brain stem symptoms in 38.8%. Stroke subtype (TOAST) was atherothrombotic (33.3%), undetermined (33.3%), cardioembolic (27.7%), and of unusual etiology (5.5%).
   RESULTS: The occlusion site was the vertebral artery in 1 case, proximal basilar artery in 4, middle basilar artery in 6, distal basilar artery in 5, and unilateral posterior cerebral artery in 2 cases. SRs included the Solitaire AB in 8 cases, Solitaire FR in 5 cases, and Trevo Pro in 5 cases. An 8F Merci balloon guide catheter was used in 15 patients, and a Neuron 6F, in 3 patients. Post-clot retrieval definitive intracranial stents were used in 5 patients (27.7%). Postprocedural TICI >= 2b was achieved in 17 patients (94.4%). Clinically, 72.2% of patients experienced an improved NIHSS score at discharge, 22.2% died, and in 5.5% the NIHSS scores did not change. The mRS score at 3 months was 0-2 in 9 patients (50%) and 3-5 in 5 patients (27.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Thrombectomy with stent retrievers is feasible in the treatment of vertebrobasilar occlusion. These initial results must be confirmed by further prospective studies with a larger number of cases.

TI Diffusion-Weighted MRI: Distinction of Skull Base Chordoma from
   Chondrosarcoma
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BONE; HISTOPATHOLOGY; CHILDREN; TUMORS; CT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base are rare tumors with overlapping presentations and anatomic imaging features but different prognoses. We hypothesized that these tumors might be distinguished by using diffusion-weighted MR imaging.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 19 patients with pathologically confirmed chordoma or chondrosarcoma who underwent both conventional and diffusion-weighted MR imaging. Differences in distributions of ADC were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Associations between histopathologic diagnosis and conventional MR imaging features (T2 signal intensity, contrast enhancement, and tumor location) were assessed with the Fisher exact test.
   RESULTS: Chondrosarcoma was associated with the highest mean ADC value (2051 +/- 261 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) and was significantly different from classic chordoma (1474 +/- 117 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) and poorly differentiated chordoma (875 +/- 100 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) (P < .001). Poorly differentiated chordoma was characterized by low T2 signal intensity (P = .001), but other conventional MR imaging features of enhancement and/or lesion location did not reliably distinguish these tumor types.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging may be useful in assessing clival tumors, particularly in differentiating chordoma from chondrosarcoma. A prospective study of a larger cohort will be required to determine the value of ADC in predicting histopathologic diagnosis.

TI Performance of Iterative Image Reconstruction in CT of the Paranasal
   Sinuses: A Phantom Study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DOSE REDUCTION; QUALITY; ANGIOGRAPHY; ALGORITHM
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT in low dose technique is the criterion standard imaging modality for evaluation of the paranasal sinus. Our aim was to evaluate the dose-reduction potential of a recently available sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction technique, regarding noise, image quality, and time duration when evaluating this region.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT was performed on a phantom head at different tube voltages (120 kV, 100 kV) and currents (100 mAs, 50 mAs, 25 mAs). Each protocol was reconstructed (in soft tissue and bony kernel) by using standard filtered back-projection and 5 different SAFIRE strengths, and image noise was evaluated. Subjective image quality was evaluated on noise-aligned image triplets acquired at tube currents of 100% (FBP), 50% (SAFIRE), and 25% (SAFIRE) by using a 5-point scale (1 = worst, 5 = best). The time duration for image reconstruction was noted for calculations with FBP and SAFIRE.
   RESULTS: SAFIRE reduced image noise by 15%-85%, depending on the iterative strength, rendering kernel, and dose parameters. Noise reduction was stronger at a bone kernel algorithm both in 1- and 3-mm images (P < .05). Subjective quality evaluation of the noise-adapted images showed preference for those acquired at 100% tube current with FBP (4.7-5.0) versus 50% dose with SAFIRE (3.4-4.4) versus 25% dose with SAFIRE (2.0-3.1). The time duration for FBP image sets was 2.9-6.6 images per second versus SAFIRE with 0.9-1.6 images per second.
   CONCLUSIONS: For CT of the paranasal sinus, SAFIRE algorithms are suitable for image-noise reduction. Because image quality decreases with dosage, careful choice of the appropriate iterative method is necessary to achieve an optimal balance between image noise and quality.

AB We studied the contribution of interictal FDG-PET ([18 F] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) in epileptic focus identification in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with positive, equivocal and negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Ninety-eight patients who underwent surgical treatment for drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy after neuropsychological evaluation, scalp video EEG monitoring, FDG-PET, MRI and/or long-term intracranial EEG and with > 12 months clinical follow-up were included in this study. FDG-PET findings were compared to MRI, histopathology, scalp video EEG and long-term intracranial EEG monitoring.
   FDG-PET lateralized the seizure focus in 95 % of MRI positive, 69 % of MRI equivocal and 84 % of MRI negative patients. There was no statistically significant difference between the surgical outcomes among the groups with Engel class I and II outcomes achieved in 86 %, 86 %, 84 % of MRI positive, equivocal and negative temporal lobe epilepsy patients, respectively. The patients with positive unilateral FDG-PET demonstrated excellent postsurgical outcomes, with 96 % Engel class I and II. Histopathology revealed focal lesions in 75 % of MRI equivocal, 84 % of MRI positive, and 23 % of MRI negative temporal lobe epilepsy cases.
   FDG-PET is an accurate noninvasive method in lateralizing the epileptogenic focus in temporal lobe epilepsy, especially in patients with normal or equivocal MRIs, or non-lateralized EEG monitoring. Very subtle findings in MRI are often associated with histopathological lesions and should be described in MRI reports. The patients with negative or equivocal MRI temporal lobe epilepsy are good surgical candidates with comparable postsurgical outcomes to patients with MRI positive temporal lobe epilepsy.

ID PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; ANTIPLATELET THERAPY; PLATELET
   REACTIVITY; PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE; RESISTANCE; ASPIRIN; EVENTS;
   RESPONSIVENESS; AGGREGATION; INHIBITION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antiplatelet therapy is associated with decreased ischemic events after neurointerventional procedures. Antiplatelet resistance negates the protective effects of antiplatelet medication, leading to a higher incidence of ischemic events. A possible link between antiplatelet hyper-response and increased hemorrhagic complications has been inadequately investigated. We aimed to examine the correlation between antiplatelet hyper-response and the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who were treated with antiplatelet medications and underwent neurointerventional procedures were prospectively recruited. We collected the following data: demographics, vascular risk factors, antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment, antiplatelet responsiveness, coagulation profile, and hemorrhagic complications. P2Y12 receptor-mediated platelet inhibition was tested by using the VerifyNow assay device. The primary end points were postprocedural major and minor hemorrhagic complications. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the percentage of platelet inhibition as a diagnostic tool for bleeding events. The association between hemorrhage and percentage of platelet inhibition was investigated by using logistic regression modeling.
   RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean age was 56 +/- 12 years, and 28% were men. Ten patients (21.3%) developed hemorrhagic complications. Clopidogrel response was higher in patients with a major bleeding complication compared with those with minor or no bleeding (median, 94% versus 24% platelet inhibition; P = .0084). Of the 7 patients (14.9%) defined as hyper-responders with >= 72% platelet inhibition, 42.8% had a major bleeding complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hyper-response to clopidogrel is associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. Larger studies are urgently needed to validate a clinically useful threshold to define clopidogrel hyper-response and to examine the clinical effects of antiplatelet dosage adjustment.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is significant interest in whether diffusion-weighted MR imaging indices, such as the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient, may be useful clinically for preoperative tumor grading and treatment planning. To help establish the pathologic correlate of minimum ADC, we undertook a study investigating the relationship between minimum ADC and maximum FDOPA PET uptake in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging and FDOPA PET data were acquired preoperatively from 15 patients who were subsequently diagnosed with high-grade brain tumor (WHO grade III or IV) by histopathologic analysis. ADC and SUVR normalized FDOPA PET maps were registered to the corresponding CE MR imaging. Regions of minimum ADC within the FDOPA-defined tumor volume were anatomically correlated with areas of maximum FDOPA SUVR uptake.
   RESULTS: Minimal anatomic overlap was found between regions exhibiting minimum ADC (a putative marker of tumor cellularity) and maximum FDOPA SUVR uptake (a marker of tumor infiltration and proliferation). FDOPA SUVR measures for tumoral regions exhibiting minimum ADC (1.36 +/- 0.22) were significantly reduced compared with those with maximum FDOPA uptake (2.45 +/- 0.88, P = .0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: There was a poor correlation between minimum ADC and the most viable/aggressive component of high-grade gliomas. This study suggests that other factors, such as tissue compression and ischemia, may be contributing to restricted diffusion in GBM. Caution should be exercised in the clinical use of minimum ADC as a marker of tumor grade and the use of this index for guiding tumor biopsies preoperatively.

TI A DSA-Based Method Using Contrast-Motion Estimation for the Assessment
   of the Intra-Aneurysmal Flow Changes Induced by Flow-Diverter Stents
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR
   TREATMENT; RECONSTRUCTION; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-diverter stents modify intra-aneurysmal blood flow and induce the progressive thrombosis of intracranial aneurysms followed by stable vascular reconstruction. The aim of this study was to report a new method for the appraisal of intracranial blood flow from DSA performed during endovascular treatment procedures.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 24 patients with unruptured IAs who underwent FDS implantation was prospectively recruited. Pre-and post-DSA sequences in combination with 3D rotational angiography were acquired. The quantification of arterial and intraaneurysmal flow was accomplished by using an optical flow approach. Flow reduction was assessed by using a new metric termed the mean aneurysm flow amplitude ratio. The correlation between the MAFA ratio and the incidence of aneurysm thrombosis was assessed by using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the Fisher exact test when the optimum Youden index was found.
   RESULTS: The quantification of flow was successfully achieved in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%). On the imaging follow-up, 18 aneurysms developed complete thrombosis (87.5%) and 3 displayed residual circulation (12.5%). The threshold analysis of the MAFA ratio significantly predicted thrombosis at 12 months below a threshold of 1.03 (P=.035). There was no significant correlation between the time for complete occlusion of the aneurysm and contrast stagnation inside the aneurysm after treatment (P>.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The MAFA ratio based on DSA flow quantification appears to be a reliable predictor for the assessment of stent treatment outcomes in this small study. These results open the door for perioperative flow quantification and provide indices that may help clinicians make appropriate intraprocedural decisions.

TI Predictors of Functional Outcome after Emergency Carotid Artery Stenting
   and Intra-Arterial Thrombolysis for Treatment of Acute Stroke Associated
   with Obstruction of the Proximal Internal Carotid Artery and Tandem
   Downstream Occlusion
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

DT Article
ID TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; RECANALIZATION;
   REVASCULARIZATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients who develop severe stroke symptoms due to acute internal carotid artery occlusion eventually in combination with a thromboembolic obstruction of the middle cerebral artery incur a major risk of developing extensive MCA infarction with a poor outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome for patients with tandem occlusions in the MCA and/or distal ICA, retrospectively, who had undergone stent implantation in the proximal segment of the ICA in addition to intra-arterial thrombolysis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with tandem occlusions of the MCA and/or distal ICA and acute occlusion of the proximal ICA underwent stent implantation for the proximal ICA occlusion and IAT for the tandem occlusion. Clinical outcome measures were assessed on admission and at discharge by using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale as well as 3 months after treatment by using the modified Rankin Scale.
   RESULTS: The median NIHSS score on admission was 12 (range, 6-22). All patients had patent flow into the M1 and ICA after carotid artery stent placement and IAT. After the procedure, 19 patients (54.3%) were TICI grade III; 7 (20.0%), TICI grade IIb; and 9 (25.7%), TICI grade IIa. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1 patient (2.9%). The overall mortality rate was 11.4% (4/35). At 3-month follow-up, the median NIHSS score was 4 (range, 1-17). NIHSS score at admission and TICI grade were all found to be independently associated with an unfavorable outcome at 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Initial stroke severity, degree of successful revascularization, and the side of ischemia were found to independently predict the functional outcome at 3 months after treatment.

   DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; 3 TESLA; MS; DEMYELINATION; BRAIN;
   VISUALIZATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 7T MR imaging has led to improved detection and classification of cortical MS lesions, mainly based on T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences. Depiction of cortical GM by using the recommended MS imaging protocol has not yet been investigated at 7T. We aimed to investigate prospectively which recommended sequence for clinical use has the highest value at 7T, in terms of GM and WM lesion detection.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with MS (mean age, 43.8 years; 25 women) and 7 healthy controls (mean age, 40.4 years; 5 women) underwent multicontrast 7T MR imaging including the recommended clinical 2D-T2WI, 3D-T1WI, 3D-FLAIR, and GM-specific 3D-DIR. Lesions were scored and categorized anatomically by 3 raters, in consensus. The value of sequences was evaluated lesion-wise and patient-wise (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
   RESULTS: At 7T, 3D-FLAIR detected the highest number of total cortical GM lesions (217), 89% more than 3D-DIR and 87% and 224% more than 2D-T2WI and 3D-T1WI. Patient-wise analysis showed that this difference between 3D-FLAIR and 3D-DIR was statistically significant (P < .04), and most pronounced for the number of mixed lesions (P < .03). 3D-FLAIR also detected the highest number of total WM lesions (2605), but the difference with 3D-DIR and 3D-T1WI was not significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: When using recommended clinical sequences at 7T, the best way to detect cortical GM lesions is with 3D-FLAIR and not by GM-specific 3D-DIR or by conventional 2D-T2WI and 3D-T1WI sequences.

TI Intra-Aneurysmal Pressure and Flow Changes Induced by Flow Diverters:
   Relation to Aneurysm Size and Shape
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WALL SHEAR-STRESS; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; HEMODYNAMICS; DEPLOYMENT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Effects of blood flow modification by flow diverters are observed to lead often to aneurysm thrombosis and reverse remodeling. For this process, to further understand the potential roles of intra-aneurysmal blood pressure changes and aneurysm morphologies, 23 patients were studied by numeric simulation.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D imaging of aneurysms of different sizes and shapes, all located at the supraclinoid segment of the ICA (n = 23), was prepared for CFD simulations. Hemodynamic variables were calculated for conditions before and after virtual FD implantation, reconstituting a vessel wall scaffold across the aneurysm neck. WSS, velocity, residence time, turnover time, and intra-aneurysmal pressure were assessed statistically.
   RESULTS: After placement of FDs, significant reductions inside the aneurysm were observed for most hemodynamic variables (P <.01) except mean intra-aneurysmal pressures. For minimum/maximum intra-aneurysmal pressure values, small but significant changes were found; however, they were considered too small to be of relevance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Calculations in 23 cases did not reveal significant intra-aneurysmal mean or peak pressure changes, indicating a minor role of pressure changes in the rare event of secondary ruptures after FD use. Other hemodynamic variables (WSS and velocity) exhibited more significant changes, indicating their role in intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation. Size-dependent, significantly higher reduction in WSS (P = .069) and velocity (P = .013) was observed in small aneurysms compared with larger ones. When it came to shape, there were significantly higher reductions in WSS (P = .055) and velocity (P = .065) and a significantly higher increase in turnover time in fusiform aneurysms compared with saccular aneurysms.

ID GIANT VERTEBROBASILAR ANEURYSMS; PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE;
   INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; FOLLOW-UP; ARTERY; EXPERIENCE; RUPTURE;
   OCCLUSION; RISK
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with fusiform basilar trunk aneurysms have a poor prognosis. Reconstructive endovascular therapy is possible with modern devices. We describe the clinical presentation, radiologic features, and clinical outcome of 13 patients with fusiform basilar trunk aneurysms treated with flow diverters, stents, and coils.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 13 patients, 7 were men and 6 were women with a mean age of 59.7 years. Clinical presentation was SAH in 3 patients, mass effect on the brain stem in 4 patients, vertebral artery dissection in 1 patient, and the aneurysm was an incidental finding in 5 patients. Mean aneurysm size was 21 mm. All except 1 were large or giant aneurysms. Nine aneurysms were partially thrombosed.
   RESULTS: Stents were used in all 13 patients, in 2 patients with additional flow diverters and in 11 patients with additional coils. In 4 patients, 1 vertebral artery was subsequently occluded with coils to decrease flow into the aneurysm. Of 13 patients, 9 had a good outcome with adequate aneurysm occlusion and stable size on follow-up of 6-72 months. One of 3 patients who presented with SAH died of a rebleed 1 month later. One other patient died soon after treatment of in-stent thrombosis, and another patient became mute after treatment. In 2 of 3 patients who presented with symptoms of mass effect, there was improvement at a follow-up of 6-24 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reconstructive endovascular therapy of fusiform and dissecting basilar trunk aneurysms is feasible but carries substantial risks. The safety and effectiveness in relation to natural history has not yet been elucidated.

AB 4D phase contrast MR imaging (4D PC MRI) has been introduced for spatiotemporal evaluation of intracranial hemodynamics in various cerebrovascular diseases. However, it still lacks validation with standards of reference. Our goal was to compare blood flow quantification derived from 4D PC MRI with transcranial ultrasound and 2D PC MRI.
   Velocity measurements within large intracranial arteries [internal carotid artery (ICA), basilar artery (BA), and middle cerebral artery (MCA)] were obtained in 20 young healthy volunteers with 4D and 2D PC MRI, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), and transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD). Maximum velocities at peak systole (PSV) and end diastole (EDV) were compared using regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots.
   Correlation of 4D PC MRI measured velocities was higher in comparison with TCD (r = 0.49-0.66) than with TCCD (0.35-0.44) and 2D PC MRI (0.52-0.60). In mid-BA and ICA C7 segment, a significant correlation was found with TCD (0.68-0.81 and 0.65-0.71, respectively). No significant correlation was found in carotid siphon. On average over all volunteers, PSVs and EDVs in MCA were minimally underestimated compared with TCD/TCCD. Minimal overestimation of velocities was found compared to TCD in mid-BA and ICA C7 segment.
   4D PC MRI appears as valid alternative for intracranial velocity measurement consistent with previous reference standards, foremost with TCD. Spatiotemporal averaging effects might contribute to vessel size-dependent mild underestimation of velocities in smaller (MCA), and overestimation in larger-sized (BA and ICA) arteries, respectively. Complete spatiotemporal flow analysis may be advantageous in anatomically complex regions (e.g. carotid siphon) relative to restrictions of ultrasound techniques.

TI The Varying Porosity of Braided Self-Expanding Stents and Flow
   Diverters: An Experimental Study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERIMENTAL-MODEL; ANEURYSMS; HEMODYNAMICS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Braided self-expandable stents and flow diverters of uniform construction may develop zones of heterogeneous porosity in vivo. Unwanted stenoses may also occur at the extremities of the device. We studied these phenomena in dedicated benchtop experiments.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five braided devices of decreasing porosity were studied. To simulate discrepancies in diameters between the landing zones of the parent vessel and the aneurysm neck area, device extremities were inserted into silicone tubes of various diameters (2-3 mm), leaving the midportion free to react to experimental manipulations, which included axial approximation of the tubes (0-7 mm), and curvature (0-135 degrees), with or without axial compression (0-2 mm). The length of the landing zone was sequentially decreased to study terminal device stenosis.
   RESULTS: All devices adopted a conformation characterized by 3 different zones: bilateral landing zones, a middle compaction zone, and 2 transition zones. It is possible, during deployment, to compact stents and FDs to decrease porosity, but a limiting factor was the transition zone, which remained relatively unchanged and of higher porosity than the expansion zone. Length of the transition zone increased when devices were constrained in smaller tubes. Heterogeneities in porosity with compaction and curvatures were predictable and followed simple geometric rules. Extremity stenoses occurred increasingly with decreasing length of the landing zone.
   CONCLUSIONS: Braided self-expandable devices show predictable changes in porosity according to device size, vessel diameter, and curvature. Adequate landing zones are required to prevent terminal device stenosis.

AB Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been used to identify characteristic patterns of regional glucose metabolism in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and the atypical parkinsonian syndromes of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). We undertook this study to assess the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in the differential diagnosis of individual patients with clinical parkinsonism. "Visual" and "computer-supported" reading of the fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scans were used for image interpretation and compared with each other.
   One hundred thirty-six parkinsonian patients were referred from movement disorder clinics in specialty neurology centers for the fluorodeoxyglucose-PET study. Imaging-based diagnosis was obtained by visual assessment of individual scans by a PET physician blinded to the clinical diagnosis and also by computer-assisted interpretation using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. The results were compared with a 2-year follow-up clinical assessment made by a movement disorder specialist.
   Concordance of visual evaluation of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET with clinical diagnosis was achieved in 91.7 % of patients scanned, 97.6 % IPD, 80 % MSA, 76.6 % PSP, and 100 % CBS. Blinded computer assessment using SPM was concordant with the clinical diagnosis in 91 % of cases evaluated (90.4 % IPD, 80 % MSA, 93.3 % PSP, and 100 % CBS).
   Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET performed at the time of initial referral for parkinsonism is useful for the differential diagnosis of IPD, PSP, MSA, and CBS. Computer-assisted methods can be used for objective evaluation especially when expert readers are not available.

AB To investigate the association of quantitative 3-T diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and clinical severity in detecting optic nerve degeneration in patients with primary closed-angle glaucoma.
   Twenty three patients (42 eyes; 9 men, 14 women) with primary closed-angle glaucoma and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Both DTI and OCT were performed on the optic nerves of all subjects. The mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and eigenvalue maps were obtained for quantitative analysis. RNFL thickness and quantitative electrophysiology were also performed on all subjects. The association of quantitative DTI with RNFL thickness and glaucoma stage was analyzed.
   Compared with control nerves, the FA, lambda(aEuro-), and lambda(aSyen) values, and RNFL thickness in affected nerves decreased, while MD increased in patients with primary glaucoma (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between FA, MD, lambda(aEuro-), and lambda(aSyen) and the mean RNFL thickness (P < 0.01). The mean FA and lambda(aSyen) values derived with DT MR imaging correlated well with glaucoma stage (P < 0.05), but the mean MD and lambda(aEuro-) values did not correlate with glaucoma stage (P > 0.05).
   DTI measurement could detect abnormality of the optic nerve in patients with glaucoma and may serve as a biomarker of disease severity.

TI Mechanical Thrombectomy in Acute Stroke: Prospective Pilot Trial of the
   Solitaire FR Device while Under Conscious Sedation
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The best approach between general anesthesia and conscious sedation to perform mechanical thrombectomy remains unknown. The goal of our study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy under conscious sedation in patients with acute ischemic stroke, using the Solitaire FR device, in a prospective, single-center, single-arm study.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a large artery occlusion within 6 hours of symptom onset for the anterior circulation, and within 24 hours for the posterior circulation. After intravenous thrombolysis (when no contraindications), thrombectomy was performed with the Solitaire device in patients under conscious sedation. Primary efficacy and safety end points were good functional outcome (mRS 2) at 3 months and mortality at 3 months. Secondary end points were recanalization (TICI 2) and failure rate.
   RESULTS: From May 2010 to July 2011, 36 patients were treated. Median baseline NIHSS score was 17.5. The occlusion site was MCA in 21 patients (58.4%), ICA-MCA tandem occlusion in 9 patients (25.0%), terminal ICA in 2 patients (5.5%), and basilar artery in 4 patients (11.1%). Twenty-three patients (63.9%) received intravenous thrombolysis. Superselective catheterization of the occluded vessel was not feasible in 5/36 cases (13.9%). Successful revascularization was achieved in 28/36 patients (77.8%). After 3 months, 22 patients (61.1%) showed good functional outcome (mRS 2) and the median NIHSS score was 8.5. Overall mortality rate at 3 months was 22.2% (8/36).
   CONCLUSIONS: In acute ischemic stroke, mechanical thrombectomy while under conscious sedation is feasible in a large percentage of cases (86.1%) and is associated with a short procedure delay and a high percentage of good functional outcomes at 3 months (61.1%).

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: IVIM MR imaging provides perfusion and diffusion information with a single diffusion-weighted MR image. We determined whether PP and D differ among various types of head and neck tumors.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort included 123 head and neck tumors: 30 SCCs, 28 benign and 20 malignant SG tumors, 36 lymphomas, and 9 schwannomas. The D and PP values were determined by using b-values of 0, 500, and 1000 s/mm(2) based on the IVIM model.
   RESULTS: The PP values (lymphomas, 0.09 0.04; SCCs, 0.15 +/- 0.04; and malignant SG tumors, 0.22 +/- 0.07) and D values (0.47 +/- 0.07 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, 0.82 +/- 0.17 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, and 1.03 +/- 0.16 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively) were significantly different among the malignant tumors (P < .01). These values were also significantly different between pleomorphic adenomas (0.13 +/- 0.02 and 1.44 +/- 0.39 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and Warthin tumors (0.19 +/- 0.04 and 0.73 +/- 0.22 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (P < .001). The PP values of malignant SG tumors were significantly different from those of pleomorphic adenomas (P = .001) and the D values of the malignant SG tumors were significantly different from those of pleomorphic adenomas (P = .002) and Warthin tumors (P = .007). Schwannomas had large PP (0.23 +/- 0.08) and D values (1.26 +/- 0.20 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), greatly overlapping those of some SG tumor types.
   CONCLUSIONS: Head and neck tumors had distinctive PP and D values by using IVIM MR imaging.

AB Previous reports have suggested that endovascular parent artery occlusion is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of vertebral artery dissection (VAD). However, the results of long-term outcomes are still unclear. This study reviewed the clinical and imaging outcomes of patients with VAD treated by endovascular internal trapping.
   A total of 73 patients were treated for VAD by endovascular internal trapping between March 1998 and March 2011. Patients were regularly followed up by magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and clinical examinations. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale.
   Forty-five patients had ruptured VADs, and 28 had unruptured VADs. Clinical follow-up of at least 6 months data was obtained for 61 patients (83.6 %). The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 145 months (mean +/- SD, 55.6 +/- 8.9 months). Two patients with ruptured VADs had recurrence (2.74 %). Cranial nerve paresis (CNP) was observed in six patients (8.21 %), spinal cord infarction in two patients (2.74 %), and a perforating artery ischemia was diagnosed in seven patients (9.59 %); all patients with CNP and five of the patients with partial Wallenberg syndrome experienced only temporary symptoms; two of the patients with partial Wallenberg syndrome had permanent neurological deficits. Despite their symptoms, most patients were in good general condition, as shown by their clinical scores.
   The results of this study have proven that endovascular internal trapping is a stable and durable treatment for closure of VADs. Recanalization is rather rare and occurred only in ruptured cases, both within 3 months after initial treatment without rupture. CNPs were observed in 8.21 %, perforating ischemia in 9.59 %, and spinal cord infarction in 2.74 %. The former two are temporary, while the last can be a factor that affects the modified Rankin Scale. Patients rated their quality of life as good, as corroborated by their posttreatment clinical score. Endovascular internal trapping for VAD is a therapy with a satisfactory long-term outcome.

AB Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. The purpose of this study is to identify areas of neurodegeneration in glaucoma utilizing 3 T magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters with whole-brain voxel-based analysis (VBA) and determine whether these parameters correlate with disease severity.
   Twenty-five glaucoma patients and 25 age-matched healthy volunteers were prospectively examined. Clinical glaucoma severity was assessed utilizing static threshold visual field parameters. All subjects underwent 3 T MRI utilizing a DTI sequence (repetition time/echo time 13,000/68.9 ms, maximal b value 800 s/mm(2) along 30 directions) and an anatomic sequence to provide structural information. All data sets were processed by VBA. Brain fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were compared in the two groups. Correlation between DTI parameters and glaucoma stage were determined.
   The bilateral optic radiations and chiasma of glaucoma patients demonstrated statistically significantly lower fractional anisotropy (p < 0.05). Optic radiation RD was similarly decreased in glaucoma patients (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences noted in MD or AD between the two groups (p > 0.05). Optic chiasm fractional anisotropy values were negatively correlated with glaucoma stage (r = -0.53, p < 0.05) and optic radiation RD values positively correlated (left r = 0.45, p < 0.05; right = 0.38, p = 0.06).
   DTI parameters fractional anisotropy and RD are altered in the optic chiasm and radiations of glaucoma patients. As fractional anisotropy and RD also correlate with glaucoma stage, these values could serve as potential noninvasive markers of disease severity.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Revascularization of large cerebral artery occlusion is the therapeutic goal in stroke therapy. Currently, many recanalization devices are in clinical use. This study compares the outcome parameters, efficacy, and safety of the new generation of stent-retriever devices with the well-established Merci retriever.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who received endovascular mechanical recanalization therapy were prospectively registered. One hundred twenty-two patients were treated with either new stent retrievers, including the Trevo and Solitaire devices, or the Merci retriever system. Recanalization of the occluded vessel was assessed in accordance with the modified TICI score, and outcome parameters, including the NIHSS and mRS scores, were documented. Clinical status was recorded after neurointervention, at time of discharge, and after 90 days.
   RESULTS: The mean age of all patients was 68 years; 54% were male, with no statistical differences in demographics between both groups. Successful recanalization (TICI 3 and TICI 2b) was achieved in 82% of patients treated with stent retrievers compared with 62% of patients treated with Merci retrievers (P = .016). In the 90-day follow-up, 65% of patients treated with stent retrievers and 35% of those treated with the Merci had achieved a good (mRS = 0-2) clinical outcome (P = .002). Patients treated with stent retrievers had a significantly shorter treatment time (72 versus 122 minutes, P < .01) and less severe intracerebral hemorrhages (10% versus 28%, P < .01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with Trevo and Solitaire stents had a better revascularization rate, better clinical outcome, and lower complication rate than patients treated with the Merci retriever.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE High-level gait disorder (HLGD) is a debilitating disorder causing mobility decline in the elderly. Although its clinical characteristics are well described, its anatomical and pathophysiological underpinnings are poorly understood. This study examined the anatomical distribution of white matter (WM) changes in patients with mild to moderate HLGD of the cautious/disequilibrium type, using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. METHODS Thirteen patients with HLGD, 9 elderly and 13 middle-aged healthy controls were scanned using diffusion tensor imaging, Q-space imaging, and conventional MRI. The regions of significant differences between the HLGD group and the elderly control group were defined, and the mean fractional anisotropy and displacement values of these areas were extracted. RESULTS The HLGD patients had lower fractional anisotropy and higher displacement values in regions related to the motor system, including those along the corticospinal tract and the superior cerebellar peduncles, as well as in cognitive and affective-related areas, including the anterior limbs of the internal capsule and the genu of the corpus callosum. CONCLUSIONS The anatomical distribution associated with HLGD of the cautious/disequilibrium type involves WM pathways that convey motor-related, cognitive and affective-related functions. The underlying pathological process leading to these changes most probably includes demyelination.

AB BACKGROUND Although multiple studies demonstrate benefits of high field imaging of cerebrovasculature, a detailed quantitative analysis of complete cerebrovascular system is unavailable. To compare quality of MR angiography (MRA) acquisitions at various field strengths, we used 3-dimensional (3D) geometric cerebrovascular models extracted from 1.5T/3T/7T scans. METHODS The 3D cerebrovascular models were compared in volume, length, and number of branches. A relationship between the vascular length and volume was statistically derived. Acquisition performance was benchmarked against the maximum volume at infinitive length. RESULTS The numbers of vessels discernible on 1.5T/3T/7T are 138/363/907. 3T shows 3.3(1.9) and 7T 1.2(9.1) times more arteries (veins) than 1.5T. The vascular lengths and volumes at 1.5T/3T/7T are 3.7/12.5/22.7 m and 15.8/26.6/28.0 cm3. For arteries: 3T-1.5T gain is very high in length, high in volume; 7T-3T gain is medium in length, small in volume. For veins: 3T-1.5T gain is moderate in length, high in volume; 7T-3T gain is very high in length, moderate in volume. 1.5T shows merely half of vascular volume. At 3T 6%, while at 7T only 1% of vascular volume is missing. CONCLUSION Our approach differs from standard approaches based on visual assessment and signal (contrast)-to-noise ratio. It also measures absolute acquisition performance, provides a unique length-volume relationship, and predicts length/volume for intermediate teslages.

AB The persistent trigeminal artery (PTA) is the most common and most cephalad-located embryological anastomosis between the developing carotid artery and vertebrobasilar system to persist into adulthood. As such, it is frequently reported as an incidental finding in computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography studies. Here, we review the embryology, anatomy, and angiographic imaging findings, including important variants of this commonly encountered cerebrovascular anomaly (reported incidence of PTA/PTA variants ranges from 0.1% to 0.76%). Further, the aim is to present the range of associated arterial anomalies or syndromes, as well as pathologies that are associated with a PTA: aneurysms, trigeminal cavernous fistulas, and trigeminal nerve compression. Besides summarizing the risks and clinical presentation of such pathologies, their management is discussed with endovascular strategies mostly being the primary choice for aneurysms and trigeminal cavernous fistulas. Symptomatic trigeminal nerve compression can be treated with microvascular decompression surgery. As an illustrative example, a case of a trigeminal cavernous fistula on a PTA variant is included, mainly to emphasize the importance of understanding the variant anatomy for treatment planning in such pathologies. Finally, recommendations on how to manage patients with PTA-associated vascular pathologies are advanced.

AB Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) with high- and ultra-high-field magnetic resonance is a very helpful tool for evaluating brain gliomas and intratumoral structures, including microvasculature. Here, we test whether objective quantification of intratumoral SWI patterns by applying fractal analysis can offer reliable indexes capable of differentiating glial tumor grades.
   Thirty-six patients affected by brain gliomas (grades II-IV, according to the WHO classification system) underwent MRI at 7 T using a SWI protocol. All images were collected and analyzed by applying a computer-aided fractal image analysis, which applies the fractal dimension as a measure of geometrical complexity of intratumoral SWI patterns. The results were subsequently statistically correlated to the histopathological tumor grade.
   The mean value of the fractal dimension of the intratumoral SWI patterns was 2.086 +/- 0.413. We found a trend of higher fractal dimension values in groups of higher histologic grade. The values ranged from a mean value of 1.682 +/- 0.278 for grade II gliomas to 2.247 +/- 0.358 for grade IV gliomas (p = 0.013); there was an overall statistically significant difference between histopathological groups.
   The present study confirms that SWI at 7 T is a useful method for detecting intratumoral vascular architecture of brain gliomas and that SWI pattern quantification by means of fractal dimension offers a potential objective morphometric image biomarker of tumor grade.

AB Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (IAMT) is an endovascular technique that allows for the acute retrieval of intravascular thrombi and is increasingly being used for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). There are currently two anaesthetic options during IAMT: general anaesthesia (GA) and conscious sedation (CS). The decision to use GA versus CS is the source of controversy, as it requires careful balance between patient pain, movement and airway protection whilst minimising time delay and haemodynamic fluctuations. This review examines and summarises the evidence for the use of GA versus CS in the treatment of AIS by IAMT.
   Studies were identified using systematic bibliographic searches. The five applicable studies were analysed with reference to overall outcomes and the key parameters that govern the decision to use GA or CS. The key parameters included the impact of GA and CS on pain, complication rates, time delays, airway protection and haemodynamic stability.
   Several retrospective analyses have shown that the use of GA is associated with adverse outcomes.
   Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy under general anaesthesia is associated with poor outcomes in observational studies. It is reasonable to offer conscious sedation as the preferred option where adverse patient factors such as agitation are lacking.

   RECANALIZATION; TRIAL; EXPERIENCE; PROUROKINASE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The time from arterial puncture to successful recanalization is an important milestone toward timely recanalization. With the significant improvement in recanalization rates by using thrombectomy devices, procedural time to recanalization is becoming a determinant factor in choosing among available devices. We aimed to assess the impact of time to recanalization on the outcome of intra-arterial stroke therapies.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting procedural times in patients with stroke treated with the MD, PS, and RS.
   RESULTS: We identified 16 eligible studies: 4 on the MD (n = 357), 8 on the PS (n = 455), and 4 on RS (n = 113). Merci device studies described total procedural duration, while PS and RS studies described puncture-to-recanalization times. With a random-effects model, mean procedural duration for the MD was 120 minutes (95% CI, 105.7-134.2 minutes). Mean puncture to recanalization time for the PS was 64.6 minutes (95% CI, 44.4-84.8 minutes) and 54.7 minutes for RS (95% CI, 47.3-62.2 minutes). Successful recanalization was achieved in 211 of 357 patients (59.1%) in the MD studies (95% CI, 49.3-77.7), 394 of 455 (86.6%) in the PS studies (95% CI, 84.1-93.8), and 105 of 113 (92.9%) in the RS studies (95% CI, 90.9-99.9). Functional independence (mRS <= 2) was achieved in 31.5% of patients in the MD studies, 36.6% in the PS studies, and 46.9% in the RS studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of the PS and RS was associated with comparable procedural time to recanalization. Available data did not allow this parameter to be determined for trials using the MD. Retrievable stents achieved the highest rate of successful recanalization and functional outcome and the lowest mortality.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Iterative reconstruction techniques facilitate CT dose reduction; though to our knowledge, no group has explored using iterative reconstruction with pediatric head CT. Our purpose was to perform a feasibility study to assess the use of ASIR in a small group of pediatric patients undergoing head CT.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Alderson-Rando head phantom was scanned at decreasing 10% mA intervals relative to our standard protocol, and each study was then reconstructed at 10% ASIR intervals. An intracranial region of interest was consistently placed to estimate noise. Our ventriculoperitoneal shunt CT protocol was subsequently modified, and patients were scanned at 20% ASIR with approximately 20% mA reductions. ASIR studies were anonymously compared with older non-ASIR studies from the same patients by 2 attending pediatric neuroradiologists for diagnostic utility, sharpness, noise, and artifacts.
   RESULTS: The phantom study demonstrated similar noise at 100% mA/0% ASIR (3.9) and 80% mA/20% ASIR (3.7). Twelve pediatric patients were scanned at reduced dose at 20% ASIR. The average CTDIvol and DLP values of the 20% ASIR studies were 22.4 mGy and 338.4 mGy-cm, and for the non-ASIR studies, they were 28.8 mGy and 444.5 mGy-cm, representing statistically significant decreases in the CTDIvol (22.1%, P =.00007) and DLP (23.9%, P =.0005) values. There were no significant differences between the ASIR studies and non-ASIR studies with respect to diagnostic acceptability, sharpness, noise, or artifacts.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that 20% ASIR can provide approximately 22% dose reduction in pediatric head CT without affecting image quality.

AB INTRODUCTION Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive dementia with a median survival of 2-14 months. The diagnosis can only be made accurately by biopsy/autopsy. However, this is not always feasible or desirable. Thus, diagnostic criteria have been proposed by UCSF, European MRI-CJD Consortium, and WHO. We will compare these criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective study of 31 patients (average age of 69.2 years) between 2003 to 2010 by ICD9 codes 046.1, 046.11, and 046.19. RESULTS All patients presented with rapidly progressive dementia (mean duration of 4.25 months). Pyramidal and extrapyramidal findings, myoclonus, cerebellar changes, akinetic mutism, and visual disturbances were observed in 6.5-48.4%. Five had periodic pattern on EEG. CSF biomarker 14-3-3 was positive in 11. Tau was positive in 6. Neuron specific enolase was positive in 9. By consensus (kappa = 0.62), MRI was typical of CJD in 23 with cortical ribboning (n = 16), basal ganglia hyperintensity (n = 15), or combination (n = 8). By WHO criteria, which does not include neuroimaging, CJD was diagnosed in 10, but 14 if any CSF biomarker was used (p = NS). The UCSF criteria, which does not include CSF biomarkers, diagnosed 18 cases, and the European MRI-CJD Consortium, which includes neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers but with less neurological signs, diagnosed 23 cases (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). CJD-mimics included urosepsis, neurosarcoidosis, idiopathic left temporal lobe epilepsy, alcohol intoxication, central nervous system vasculitis, viral encephalitis, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION This study illustrates the variability in diagnosing CJD and emphasizes the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging. It also highlights false-positives that occur with neuroimaging.

AB High-porosity (HP) and flow-diverting (FD) stents are increasingly used to treat intracranial aneurysms. In vivo device deformations and their impact on the porosity of the segment of device lying over the aneurysm neck remain inadequately characterized.
   Porosities of different braided FDs were studied in straight and 90A degrees curved glass tubes. In vivo, 11 experimental lateral wall aneurysms were treated with FD (n = 7) or HP (n = 4) stents. At 3 months, the segment of FDs and HP stents over the aneurysm neck was analyzed, paying attention to changes in device diameter, metallic porosity, and neointimal closure of pores over the aneurysm or branch ostia. Device deformations were reproduced with benchtop experiments.
   In 90A degrees curved tubes, FD porosity was higher (P = 0.025) and pore density was lower (P = 0.01) on convex compared to concave surfaces, but variations remained within 5-10 %. After in vivo deployment, a spindle-shaped deformation of FDs occurred, with focal expansion at the level of the aneurysm neck (P = 0.004). This deformation translated into an accordion-like distribution of stent struts across the aneurysm neck, where porosity was not uniform. The midsection of the aneurysm ostium had more metal coverage than adjacent ostial areas (P = 0.002). Mean porosity over the aneurysm neck was 78 A +/- 9.4 and 32.6 A +/- 12.1 % for HP and FD stents, respectively (P = 0.008), decreasing to 13.0 A +/- 10.1 and 1.4 A +/- 0.6 % (P = 0.022) following neointimal coverage, respectively. Spindle-shaped deformations and accordion effects were reproduced with benchtop manipulations; fluctuations in porosity and diameter changes correlated closely (R = 0.81; P = 0.005).
   Alterations in porosity may occur following in vivo implantation.

AB Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms has been an effective treatment option. In this paper, we report our experience with the Silk stent (SS) for endovascular treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms and present periprocedural events, immediate results, delayed complications, and imaging and clinical follow-up results.
   We retrospectively examined angiographic images and clinical reports of 76 consecutive patients with 87 intracranial aneurysms who were treated with SSs between March 2008 and June 2011.
   All aneurysms could be successfully covered technically using implanted SSs, with an overall mortality of 6.6 %. Two transient morbidities (2.6 %) and three permanent morbidities due to embolic events (3.9 %) were observed. Unexpected procedural technical events occurred in 18 procedures (18/78, 23.1 %). Control angiographies were performed in all 71 patients with 82 aneurysms (100 %). Mean angiographic follow-up time was 17.5 +/- 11.1 months [range 2-48 months]. Sixteen of the 71 patients with 19 aneurysms had only early angiographic controls in the first 6 months while remaining 55 patients with 63 aneurysms (77.5 %) had late controls after 6 months. Overall control angiographic occlusion rates were as follows: 87.8 % (72/82) total occlusion, 8.5 % residual aneurysm filling, and 3.7 % residual neck filling. The general in-stent stenosis rate in controls was 5.6 % and the stented parent artery occlusion rate was 4.2 %. Five (6.6 %) aneurysms ruptured after stent implantation in our series.
   The Silk stent is an effective tool for the treatment of challenging aneurysms, which have previously demonstrated higher re-growth rates and technical problems, despite unexpected higher hemorrhage rates after treatment and deployment difficulties.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain MR imaging is routinely performed in the work-up of suspected PD, yet its role is essentially limited to the exclusion of other pathologies. We performed a pattern-recognition analysis based on DTI data to detect subjects with PD at the individual level.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 40 consecutive patients with Parkinsonism suggestive of PD who had DTI at 3T, brain (123)vertical bar ioflupane SPECT (DaTSCAN), and extensive neurologic testing including follow-up (17 PD: age range, 67.8 +/- 6.7 years; 9 women; 23 Other: consisting of atypical forms of Parkinsonism; age range, 67.2 +/- 9.7 years; 7 women). Data analysis included group-level TBSS and individual-level SVM classification.
   RESULTS: At the group level, patients with PD versus Other had spatially consistent increase in FA and decrease in RD and MD in a bilateral network, predominantly in the right frontal white matter. At the individual level, SVM correctly classified patients with PD at the individual level with accuracies up to 97%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Support vector machine based pattern recognition of DTI data provides highly accurate detection of patients with PD among those with suspected PD at an individual level, which is potentially clinically applicable. Because most suspected subjects with PD undergo brain MR imaging, already existing MR imaging data may be reused; this practice is very cost-efficient.

TI Efficacy and Safety of Flow Diversion for Paraclinoid Aneurysms: A
   Matched-Pair Analysis Compared with Standard Endovascular Approaches
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; DISRUPTING DEVICE;
   STENTS; RECONSTRUCTION; EXPERIENCE; ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow diversion is a new strategy for the treatment of complex paraclinoid aneurysms. However, flow diverters have, to date, not been tested in direct comparison with other available treatments. We present a matched-pair comparison of paraclinoid aneurysms treated with the PED versus other endovascular techniques.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one eligible patients with 22 paraclinoid aneurysms treated with the PED at our institution were matched with historic controls with aneurysms of similar size and location.
   RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of aneurysm size, location, risk factors, or comorbidities. Mean dome size was 13.9 +/- 6.7 mm in the control group and 14.9 +/- 6.3 mm in the PED group (P = .52). Balloon and stent assistance were used in 31.8% and 9.1% of controls, respectively, while carotid sacrifice was used in 36.4% of the controls. There was a significant difference in the rate of complete occlusion favoring PED at radiologic follow-up (P = .03).
   CONCLUSIONS: Flow diverters achieve a much higher rate of complete angiographic obliteration compared with other standard endovascular techniques in the treatment of internal carotid artery aneurysms. In this series, this higher angiographic obliteration rate did not occur at the expense of an increased rate of complications. Careful long-term follow-up is of the utmost importance to definitively validate flow diversion as a superior therapeutic strategy for proximal internal carotid artery aneurysms.

TI Effects of Flow-Diverting Device Oversizing on Hemodynamics Alteration
   in Cerebral Aneurysms
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; RECONSTRUCTION; EXPERIENCE; PIPELINE; STENT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-diverting devices are increasingly being considered for large or giant aneurysms with wide necks, which are difficult to treat with coils or clips. These devices are often oversized to achieve good positioning against the artery wall. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of oversized flow-diverting devices in altering aneurysmal flows and creating hemodynamic environments favorable for thrombosis and aneurysm occlusion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models of 3 cerebral aneurysms were constructed from 3D angiography images. Numeric simulations of the hemodynamics after implanting stents of increasing diameters were performed. The corresponding modifications of hemodynamic variables such as aneurysm inflow rate, average velocity, shear rate, and wall shear stress were calculated and compared.
   RESULTS: The results indicate that because the devices are oversized, the stent cells stretch in the direction of the vessel axis, change cell angles, and result in larger cells. This change in the cell geometry causes a diminution of the hemodynamic performance of the stent. Quantitatively, stent oversizing results in larger values of aneurysm inflow rates, average velocity, shear rate, and wall shear stress compared with nonoversizing cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of flow-diverting devices in modifying intra-aneurysmal flow can be substantially reduced by oversizing the devices. As the level of device oversize increases, aneurysmal hemodynamic variables are significantly less affected.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There have been few neuroimaging studies of pediatric CM, a common often fatal tropical condition. We undertook a prospective study of pediatric CM to better characterize the MRI features of this syndrome, comparing findings in children meeting a stringent definition of CM with those in a control group who were infected with malaria but who were likely to have a nonmalarial cause of coma.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive children admitted with traditionally defined CM (parasitemia, coma, and no other coma etiology evident) were eligible for this study. The presence or absence of malaria retinopathy was determined. MRI findings in children with ret+ CM (patients) were compared with those with ret- CM (controls). Two radiologists blinded to retinopathy status jointly developed a scoring procedure for image interpretation and provided independent reviews. MRI findings were compared between patients with and without retinopathy, to assess the specificity of changes for patients with very strictly defined CM.
   RESULTS: Of 152 children with clinically defined CM, 120 were ret+, and 32 were ret-. Abnormalities much more common in the patients with ret+ CM were markedly increased brain volume; abnormal T2 signal intensity; and DWI abnormalities in the cortical, deep gray, and white matter structures. Focal abnormalities rarely respected arterial vascular distributions. Most of the findings in the more clinically heterogeneous ret- group were normal, and none of the abnormalities noted were more prevalent in controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: Distinctive MRI findings present in patients meeting a stringent definition of CM may offer insights into disease pathogenesis and treatment.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: VBM has been widely used to study GM atrophy in MS. MS lesions lead to segmentation and registration errors that may affect the reliability of VBM results. Improved segmentation and registration have been demonstrated by WM LI before segmentation. DARTEL appears to improve registration versus the USM. Our aim was to compare the performance of VBM-DARTEL versus VBM-USM and the effect of LI in the regional analysis of GM atrophy in MS.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3T T1 MR imaging scans were acquired from 26 patients with RRMS and 28 age-matched NC. LI replaced WM lesions with normal-appearing WM intensities before image segmentation. VBM analysis was performed in SPM8 by using DARTEL and USM with and without LI, allowing the comparison of 4 VBM methods (DARTEL + LI, DARTEL - LI, USM + LI, and USM - LI). Accuracy of VBM was assessed by using NMI, CC, and a simulation analysis.
   RESULTS: Overall, DARTEL + LI yielded the most accurate GM maps among the 4 methods (highest NMI and CC, P < .001). DARTEL + LI showed significant GM loss in the bilateral thalami and caudate nuclei in patients with RRMS versus NC. The other 3 methods overestimated the number of regions of GM loss in RRMS versus NC. LI improved the accuracy of both VBM methods. Simulated data suggested the accuracy of the results provided from patient MR imaging analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a pipeline that shows promise in limiting segmentation and registration errors in VBM analysis in MS.

AB The clinical differentiation of Parkinson's disease (PD) from multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may be challenging, especially in their early stages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurement to distinguish among these degenerative disorders.
   Twenty-five MSA, 20 PSP, and 17 PD patients and 18 healthy controls were retrospectively studied. Axial diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted images were obtained using a 3-T MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were precisely placed in the midbrain, pons, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, thalamus, superior cerebellar peduncle, middle cerebellar peduncle, cerebellar white matter, and cerebellar dentate nucleus, and the regional ADC (rADC) value was calculated in each ROI.
   In MSA, rADC values in the pons, middle cerebellar peduncle, cerebellar white matter, and cerebellar dentate nucleus were significantly higher than in PSP, PD, and controls. Furthermore, rADC values in the posterior putamen were significantly higher in MSA than in PSP and controls. In PSP, rADC values were significantly higher in the globus pallidus and midbrain than in MSA, PD, and controls. Furthermore, rADC values in the caudate nucleus and superior cerebellar peduncle were significantly higher in PSP than in MSA and controls. In PD, there were no significant differences in the rADC values compared to in MSA, PSP, and controls in all regions.
   Evaluation of rADC values in characteristic lesions in MSA, PSP, and PD by placing ROIs using 3-T systems can provide useful additional information for differentiating these disorders.

AB Immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease is a recently designated benign clinical entity histopathologically characterized by sclerosing inflammation and infiltration of numerous IgG4+ plasma cells that affects multiple organs. The purpose of this study is to characterize the imaging findings of patients with histopathologically proven IgG4-related disease in the head, neck, and brain.
   A total of 17 patients (15 males, 2 females; mean age, 66.1 +/- 7.4 years) with histopathologically proven IgG4-related disease in the head, neck, and brain were identified in two hospitals between January 2004 and December 2010. Imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed, with particular attention to the location and number of lesions, internal architecture, enhancement patterns, presence of vascular occlusion or compression, and changes in adjacent bones.
   The lesions, presented as either enlarged gland(s), or focal, localized nodules/masses, were distributed in the lacrimal gland (n = 7), the parotid gland (n = 14), the submandibular gland (n = 10), the pituitary gland (n = 2), skull base dura mater (n = 2), and the pterygopalatine fossa (n = 3). All lesions were well-defined and iso- to hypointense on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and showed homogeneous enhancement. No lesion showed vascular occlusion or compression. Bones adjacent to the lesions showed remodeling (erosion or sclerosis) without signs of destruction (n = 6). Four patients had lesions involving multiple areas which extended along the trigeminal nerve, accompanied by expansion of neural foramina along their courses, with no signs of bone destruction.
   Sites of predilection for IgG4-related disease in the head, neck, and brain include the lacrimal, salivary, and pituitary glands. Recognition of the typical radiological features of IgG4-related disease, such as well-defined lesion borders, T2 hypointensity, homogeneous and gradual enhancement pattern, absence of vascular occlusion or compression, and presence of bone remodeling without destruction, may be of help in the diagnosis of this benign clinical entity.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disease affecting both WM and GM. While WM lesions are easily visualized by conventional MR imaging, the detection of GM alterations remains challenging. This diffusion tensor MR imaging study aimed to detect and characterize diffuse microscopic alterations in 2 deep GM structures, the caudate nucleus and the thalamus, in patients with RR and SP MS. The relationship between diffusivity markers, and atrophy of the caudate and the thalamus, as well as brain lesion load and clinical status of the patients was also explored.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three RR and 18 SP patients, along with 27 healthy controls, underwent MR imaging examination including anatomic and DTI acquisitions. Volumes, mean FA, and MD of the caudate and the thalamus, as well as WM lesion volumes, were assessed.
   RESULTS: FA was significantly (P < .001) increased in the caudate and the thalamus of patients with MS compared with controls, and was higher in SP compared with RR patients. Increased FA was associated with volume decreases of caudate (r = -0.712; P < .0011 and thalamus (r = 0.407; P < .011 in patients with MS. WM T2 lesion load was significantly associated with caudate (r = -0.611; P < .0011 and thalamic (r = 0.354; P < .051 FA. Caudate FA, and, to a lesser extent, thalamic FA, were associated with functional deficits, as measured by EDSS and MSFC.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increased FA in the caudate and the thalamus may constitute a sensitive marker of MS pathologic processes, such as loss of dendrites and/or swelling of neuronal cell bodies.

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious disease typically occurring in the brain whose diagnosis and efficacy of treatment monitoring are vital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently used in serial brain imaging due to the rich and detailed information provided.
   Time-series analysis of images is widely used for MS diagnosis and patient follow-up. However, conventional manual methods are time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Thus, the development of automated techniques for the detection and quantification of MS lesions is a major challenge.
   This paper presents an up-to-date review of the approaches which deal with the time-series analysis of brain MRI for detecting active MS lesions and quantifying lesion load change. We provide a comprehensive reference source for researchers in which several approaches to change detection and quantification of MS lesions are investigated and classified. We also analyze the results provided by the approaches, discuss open problems, and point out possible future trends.
   Lesion detection approaches are required for the detection of static lesions and for diagnostic purposes, while either quantification of detected lesions or change detection algorithms are needed to follow up MS patients. However, there is not yet a single approach that can emerge as a standard for the clinical practice, automatically providing an accurate MS lesion evolution quantification. Future trends will focus on combining the lesion detection in single studies with the analysis of the change detection in serial MRI.

AB Recently two classification methods based on the location and the extent of thrombosis detected with CT angiography have been introduced: the Boston Acute Stroke Imaging Scale (BASIS) and the clot burden score (CBS). We studied the performance of BASIS and CBS in predicting good clinical outcome (mRS a parts per thousand currency sign2 at 90 days) in an acute (< 3 h) stroke cohort treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy.
   Eighty-three consecutive patients who underwent multimodal CT were analyzed. Binary logistic regression model was used to assess how BASIS, CBS, and cerebral blood volume (CBV) ASPECTS predict favorable clinical outcome. Diagnostic sensitivities and specificities were calculated and compared.
   Patients with low CBS and CBV ASPECTS scores and major strokes according to BASIS had significantly higher admission NIHSS scores, larger perfusion defects, and more often poor clinical outcome. In logistic regression analysis, CBV ASPECTS, CBS and BASIS were significantly associated with the clinical outcome. The performance of BASIS improved when patients with thrombosis of the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery were classified as having minor stroke (M1-BASIS). In the anterior circulation, the sum of CBS and CBV ASPECTS (CBSV) proved to be the most robust predictor of favorable outcome. CBV ASPECTS and CBS had high sensitivity but moderate to poor specificity while BASIS was only moderately sensitive and specific.
   CBS, BASIS, and CBV ASPECTS are statistically robust and sensitive but unspecific predictors of good clinical outcome. Two new derived imaging parameters, CBSV and M1-BASIS, share these properties and may have increased prognostic value.

AB Since the flow diverters (FDs) have been introduced it is possible to treat aneurysms that are considered difficult or impossible to treat with usual endovascular or surgical methods. It is still uncertain which aneurysms are suitable for this new treatment. We present the periprocedural complications, immediate result, late complications, imaging follow-up at 6 and 12 months and clinical follow-up at 2-23 months.
   Twenty-two patients with 26 wide-necked or blister-like aneurysms had 23 treatments with implantation of a Silk stent. Eleven patients had re-canalizations, and 11 patients were either untreated or had been treated for another aneurysm.
   Periprocedural complications were seen in four treatments (17%). However, none of these had clinical consequences. Mortality and morbidity rates were 1 of 22 (5%) and 1 of 22 (5%), respectively. Clinical outcome was unchanged in 16 patients (72%), 3 patients improved (14%) and 3 patients worsened (14%). The end-of-procedure angiography did not show complete occlusion of any of the aneurysms, but at 6 months follow-up angiography, 17 of 25 aneurysms (68%) were completely occluded, and at 12 months, 18 of 21 aneurysms (86%) were occluded.
   The effect of the Silk FD in terms of occlusion of the aneurysms seems to occur mainly during the first 6 months after placement but continues during the following time. Most delayed complications occur immediately after discontinuing the anticoagulation medication. Considering the complexity of the aneurysms treated, the rate of complications is acceptable.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To determine the proper method for the normalization of spinal cord volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS A group of 34 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (28 relapsing and 6 progressive) and 15 healthy controls had whole spinal cord 3-mm thick T2-weighted axial fast spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images obtained at 3T. For each participant, four volumes were measured (C2-3 volume, cervical cord volume, thoracic cord volume, and whole cord volume). The volumes were normalized by the number of slices and three potential measures of body size (intracranial volume [ICV], body mass index, and body surface area) using the proportional method. RESULTS All raw volumes and volumes normalized by number of slices or ICV were significantly lower in progressive MS patients compared to relapsing MS patients/healthy controls (P < .05). In addition, C2-3 volume and cervical cord volume were significantly correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale score (P < .05). All regional volumes showed high intercorrelation, and normalization by the number of slices significantly increased some correlations. Regarding reliability, whole cord volume regardless of normalization technique had lower coefficient of variation than C2-3 volume. CONCLUSIONS Since normalization factor had limited impact on reliability and the ability to detect differences, normalization by the number of slices is recommended.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contrast extravasation in DSC-MRI potentiates inaccurate and imprecise estimates of glioma rCBV. We tested assertions that preload and postprocessing algorithms minimize this error by comparing Gd-rCBV using permutations of these 2 techniques with criterion standard rCBV using MION, an intravascular agent.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We imaged 7 Fisher rats with 9L gliosarcomas, by using 3T gradient-echo DSC-MRI with MION (2.0 mg Fe/kg) and staged injection of Gd-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid: a 0.1-mmol/kg bolus provided no preload (P-) data and served as preload (P+) for a subsequent 0.2-mmol/kg bolus. We computed MION-rCBV (steady-state Delta R2*, tumor versus normal brain) and Gd-rCBV Delta R2* [t] integration) without (C-) and with (C+) postprocessing correction, thereby testing 4 correction permutations: P-C, P-C+, P+C, and P+C+. We tested whether each permutation reduced bias and variance of the Gd/MION rCBV differences by using generalized estimating equations and Fmax statistics (P < .05 significant).
   RESULTS: Gd-rCBV progressively better approximated MION-rCBV with increasing leakage correction. There was no statistically significant bias for the mean percentage deviation of Gd-rCBV from MION-rCBV for any correction permutation, but there was significantly reduced variance by using P+C (22-fold), P-C+ (32-fold), and P+C+ (267-fold) compared with P-C. P+C+ provided significant additional variance reduction compared with P+C- (12-fold) and P-C+ (8-fold). Linear regression of Gd-rCBV versus MION-rCBV revealed P+C+ to have the closest slope and intercept compared with the ideal, substantially better than P+C-.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preload and postprocessing correction significantly reduced the variance of Gd-rCBV estimates, and bias reduction approached significance. Postprocessing correction provide significant benefit beyond preload alone.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identification of ICH, particularly after ischemic stroke therapy, is important for guiding subsequent antithrombotic management and is often confounded by contrast staining or extravasations within intracerebral or extra-axial compartments. This study evaluates the accuracy of DECT in distinguishing ICH from iodinated contrast in patients who received contrast via IA or IV delivery.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients who had received IA or IV contrast were evaluated using a DECT scanner at 80kV and 140kV to distinguish hyperdensities secondary to contrast staining or extravasation from those representing ICH. A 3-material decomposition algorithm was used to obtain virtual noncontrast images and iodine overlay images. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of DECT in prospectively distinguishing intracranial contrast from hemorrhage within parenchymal, subarachnoid, extra-axial, intraventricular, and intra-arterial compartments were computed using routine clinical follow-up imaging as the standard of reference.
   RESULTS: A total of 148 foci of intracranial hyperattenuation were identified. Of these, 142 were correctly classified for the presence of hemorrhage by DECT. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying hemorrhage, depending on the compartment being considered, were 100%, 84.4%- 100%, and 87.2%-100%, respectively. The only instances where DECT failed to correctly identify the source of hyperattenuation was in the presence of diffuse parenchymal calcification (n = 5) and a metallic streak artifact (n = 1).
   CONCLUSION: After IA and/or IV contrast administration, DECT can accurately differentiate all types of ICH from iodinated contrast without employing any additional radiation.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PRES-related vasogenic edema is potentially reversible while hemorrhage occurs in only 15.2%-17.3% of patients. However, the true incidence of hemorrhage could be higher when SWI is considered. Thus, we set out to determine the incidence of MH, SAH, and IPH in PRES by using SWI and to particularly evaluate whether such MHs are reversible.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with PRES and SWI were included, 17 having follow-up SWI. Two neuroradiologists reviewed SWI, FLAIR, DWI, and CE-T1WI. The presence and number of MHs (< 5 mm) on SWI, SAH, and IPH (> 5 mm) were recorded at presentation and follow-up. We evaluated associations between the presence of MH on SWI and DWI lesions, SAH, IPH, contrast enhancement, and MR imaging severity.
   RESULTS: Hemorrhage was present in 20/31 patients (64.5%), with MHs on SWI in 18/31 (58.1%) at presentation and in 11/17 (64.7%) at follow-up. SAH was present in 3/31 on SWI and 4/31 on FLAIR, while 2/31 had IPH. At follow-up, no patients had acquired new MHs; 2/5 MHs in 1 patient resolved. Four patients with available SWI before PRES developed MHs after PRES onset. No association was found between the presence of MHs on SWI and DWI, SAH, IPH, enhancement, and MR imaging severity (all P > .05).
   CONCLUSIONS: SWI showed a higher rate of MH than previously described, underscoring the potential of SWI in evaluating PRES. Such MHs typically persist and may develop after PRES onset. However, the clinical relevance of MHs in PRES is yet to be determined. We propose that MHs in PRES relate to endothelial cell dysfunction.

TI Investigation of Long-Term Reproducibility of Intrinsic Connectivity

DT Article
ID FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT-MODE; HUMAN BRAIN; SMALL-WORLD;
   MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; BOLD SIGNAL; CORTEX; FLUCTUATIONS; ORGANIZATION; SINGLE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Connectivity mapping based on resting-state fMRI is rapidly developing, and this methodology has great potential for clinical applications. However, before resting-state fMRI can be applied for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment for an individual patient with neurologic or psychiatric diseases, it is essential to assess its long-term reproducibility and between-subject variations among healthy individuals. The purpose of the study was to quantify the long-term test-retest reproducibility of ICN measures derived from resting-state fMRI and to assess the between-subject variation of ICN measures across the whole brain.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal resting-state fMRI data of 6 healthy volunteers were acquired from 9 scan sessions during > 1 year. The within-subject reproducibility and between-subject variation of ICN measures, across the whole brain and major nodes of the DMN, were quantified with the ICC and COV.
   RESULTS: Our data show that the long-term test-retest reproducibility of ICN measures is outstanding, with > 70% of the connectivity networks showing an ICC > 0.60. The COV across 6 healthy volunteers in this sample was > 0.2, suggesting significant between-subject variation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that resting-state ICN measures (eg, the correlation coefficients between fMRI signal-intensity profiles from 2 different brain regions) are potentially suitable as biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and treatment effects in clinical trials and individual patients. Because between-subject variation is significant, it may be difficult to use quantitative ICN measures in their current state as a diagnostic tool.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A new FPCT application offers the possibility of perfusion (FPCT CBV) and parenchymal (FPCT) imaging within the angiography suite. We tested the hypothesis that findings in FPCT CBV and FPCT would correlate with those obtained using MSCT and PCT. MATERIALS AND
   METHODS: In 16 patients with acute MCA occlusion, FPCT CBV was performed immediately posttreatment. The volume of tissue having abnormal CBV values was determined by FPCT CBV and PCT images. Stroke volume on follow-up MSCT was determined, CBV values in the effected parenchyma were measured, and FPCT images were reviewed.
   RESULTS: In 6 cases, we found a FPCT CBV value identical or higher (hyperemia) in comparison with the contralateral side. In 10 cases, we found CBV lesions with values lower (oligemia) than the contralateral brain tissue. We found a high correlation of CBV lesion volume on FPCT CBV images to stroke volume on follow-up MSCT (r = 0.9, P < .05) in the oligemia group. Absolute FPCT CBV and PCT CBV values were comparable and showed good correlation (r = 0.9, P < .05). In 8 patients, contrast medium extravasation was visible.
   CONCLUSIONS: The new FPCT application allows assessment of CBV in acute stroke patients. Our initial results indicate that these measurements may predict final infarct volume. The ability to assess this key parameter of cerebral perfusion within the angiographic suite may improve the management of these patients.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI is increasingly being used as a measure to study tissue damage in several neurologic diseases. Our aim was to investigate the comparability of DTI measures between different MR imaging magnets and platforms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two healthy volunteers underwent DTI on five 31 MR imaging scanners (3 Trios and 2 Signas) by using a matched 33 noncollinear diffusion-direction pulse sequence. Within each subject, a total of 16 white matter (corpus callosum, periventricular, and deep white matter) and gray matter (cortical and deep gray) ROIs were drawn on a single image set and then were coregistered to the other images. Mean FA, ADC, and longitudinal and transverse diffusivities were calculated within each ROI. Concordance correlations were derived by comparing ROI DTI values among each of the 5 magnets.
   RESULTS: Mean concordance for FA was 0.96; for both longitudinal and transverse diffusivities, it was 0.93; and for ADC, it was 0.88. Mean scan-rescan concordance was 0.96-0.97 for all DTI measures. Concordance correlations within platforms were, in general, better than those between platforms for all DTI measures (mean concordance of 0.96).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that a 3T magnet and high-angular-resolution pulse sequence yielded comparable DTI measurements across different MR imaging magnets and platforms. Our results indicate that FA is the most comparable measure across magnets, followed by individual diffusivities. The comparability of DTI measures between different magnets supports the feasibility of multicentered clinical trials by using DTI as an outcome measure.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In cerebral gliomas, rCBV correlates with tumor grade and histologic findings of vascular proliferation. Moreover, ADC assesses water diffusivity and is inversely correlated with tumor grade. In the present work, we have studied whether combined rCBV and ADC values improve the diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging in the preoperative grading of gliomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-two patients with histopathologically confirmed diffuse gliomas underwent DWI and DSC. Mean rCBV and ADC values were compared among the tumor groups with the Student t test or ANOVA. ROC analysis was used to determine rCBV and ADC threshold values for glioma grading.
   RESULTS: rCBV had significantly different values between grade II and IV gliomas and between grade III and IV tumors, but there were no significant differences between grade II and III gliomas (P > .05). Grade II and III tumors also did not differ when astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas were considered separately. ADC values were significantly different for all 3 grades. The ADC threshold value of 1.185 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s and the rCBV cutoff value of 1.74 could be used with high sensitivity in the characterization of high-grade gliomas. The area under the ROC curve for the maximum rCBV and minimum ADC was 0.72 and 0.75, respectively. The combination of rCBV and ADC values increased the area under the ROC curve to 0.83.
   CONCLUSIONS: ADC measurements are better than rCBV values for distinguishing the grades of gliomas. The combination of minimum ADC and maximum rCBV improves the diagnostic accuracy of glioma grading.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The pathological differences underlying the clinical disease phases in multiple sclerosis (MS) are poorly characterized. We sought to explore the relationship between the distribution of white matter (WM) lesions in relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) MS and the normal regional variability of cerebral perfusion.
   METHODS WM lesions were identified and quantified on a single magnetic resonance imaging scan from 1,249 patients with MS. The spatial distribution of lesions was compared between early RR, late RR, and SP MS in the context of normal cerebral perfusion patterns provided by a single-photon emission-computed tomography atlas of healthy individuals.
   RESULTS Patients with SP MS had more distinct and larger lesions than patients with RR MS. Across all subjects, lesions were present in regions of relatively lower normal perfusion than normal appearing WM. Further, lesions in SP MS were more common in areas of lower perfusion as compared to the lesion distribution in early and late RR MS.
   CONCLUSION Chronic plaques were more prevalent in WM regions with lower relative perfusion. Lesions in more highly perfused regions were more commonly observed in early RR MS and therefore, may be more likely to successfully remyelinate and resolve.

   FOLLOW; RECONSTRUCTION; EMBOLIZATION; RUPTURE; APEX
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wide-neck bifurcating aneurysms are increasingly treated with intracranial stent-assisted coiling by using shape-memory alloy microstents. We sought to investigate the short- and long-term effects of intracranial stent implantation on the geometry and angular conformation of the stent-coiled vascular bifurcation.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent stent-mediated coiling for 31 bifurcation aneurysms by using 31 self-expanding Neuroform (n = 14) and Enterprise In = 17) stents (17 women; mean age, 56 years). The angle (delta) between the stented mother and daughter vessels at the bifurcation was measured by using multiplanar imaging of reconstructed rotational conventional angiography volumes and was compared by using matched-pair statistics. Neuroform and Enterprise longitudinal stent stiffness was measured in vitro at an increasing bending angle theta (theta = 180 degrees - delta).
   RESULTS: Stent deployment increased the bifurcation angle delta from 101.5 degrees to 119.8 degrees postprocedurally and to 137.3 degrees (P < .0001) at latest follow-up, resulting in effective straightening; the angular remodeling was greater in distal-versus-proximal arteries (anterior cerebral > MCA > BA > ICA), inversely proportional to mother-vessel diameter and proportional to pretreatment bending angle theta. At follow-up, angle delta continued to significantly expand, with remodeling being greater in the early period (1-6 versus > 7 months) and more pronounced with the longitudinally stiffer closed-cell Enterprise compared with the open-cell Neuroform stent.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stent placement across bifurcation aneurysms leads to a significant biphasic angular remodeling related to stent type and vessel caliber, altering morphology to mimic sidewall lesions, a phenomenon needing consideration during procedural planning. Future work is needed to uncover the hemodynamic implications of this structural change and any possible effect on aneurysm-recurrence rates.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pathologic studies suggest that neovascularization and hemorrhage are important features of plaque vulnerability for disruption. Our aim was to determine the associations of these features in carotid plaques with previous cerebrovascular ischemic events by using high-resolution CE-MAI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients (36 men; mean age 72.5 +/- 10 years) underwent CE-MRI and MRA examinations for carotid plaque at 3T. IPH presence was recorded. Neovascularity was categorized by the degree of adventitial enhancement (0, absent; 1, <50%; 2, >= 50%). Reader variability was assessed by using weighted K. Associations with events were determined by using multivariable logistic regression.
   RESULTS: Intra- and inter-reader agreement for grading adventitial enhancement were good to excellent. IPH was present in 49% of patients and was associated with events (P = .03). Patients grouped by categories 0, 1, and 2 adventitial enhancement had increasing frequencies of events (14% category 0, 48% category 1, 65% category 2; P = .02). Events were associated with IPH (OR, 10.18; 95% CI, 1.42-72.21) and adventitial enhancement (compared with category 0: OR, 14.90, 95% CI, 0.98-225.93 for category 1; OR, 51.17, 95% CI, 3.4-469.8 for category 2) after controlling for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, wall thickness, and stenosis. Stenosis was not associated with events.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adventitial enhancement and IPH are independently associated with previous events and may provide important insight into stroke risk not achievable by stenosis.

ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; RUPTURE; HEMORRHAGE; RISKS
AB BACKGROUND It is still controversial whether intravenous (IV) thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke increases the risk of aneurysmal bleeding. We sought to find the risk for aneurysmal bleeding after IV thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms.
   METHODS We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who had received IVT between August 2006 and November 2009. Immediately after IV-tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy (. 9 mg/kg), patients underwent CT angiography, MR angiography. After that, all patients underwent follow-up angiography within 36 hours of the initiation of IV thrombolysis. Aneurysm-related hemorrhage was defined as a hemorrhage that was related to the aneurysm site.
   RESULTS A total of 201 patients were analyzed, and 8 (4.1%) had unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Of the 8 patients, 4 had aneurysms over 5 mm of the longest diameter. Three patients had intracerebral hemorrhage that developed at the site of infarction, which was unrelated to the aneurysms.
   CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that IV thrombolysis might not increase the risk of aneurysmal bleeding in acute stroke patients with unruptured aneurysm < 10 mm in diameter. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm our result.

   LOCALIZATION; EXPLORATION; NECK
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 4D-CT is a novel method of multiphase CT imaging. When used to localize parathyroid adenomas and hyperplasia, this technique may allow for more robust diagnostic accuracy than traditional sonography and nuclear scintigraphy techniques. The purpose of our study is to assess the accuracy of 4D-CT for localizing pathologically proved parathyroid adenomas and hyperplasia found during surgery.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 pathologically proved cases of parathyroid adenoma and hyperplasia were retrospectively reviewed between January 2009 and March 2011. Inclusion criteria were availability of final surgical pathology and performance of preoperative 4D-CT. No cases were excluded. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 4D-CT were ascertained including both the side and quadrant of the pathologically proved lesion.
   RESULTS: Of the 35 pathologically proved cases collected over the study period, 32 (sensitivity = 91%) patients were found positive for parathyroid disease using 4D-CT, including 3 cases of rnultigland disease. For lateralization of single-gland disease, 4D-CT demonstrated an accuracy of 93%. 4D-CT revealed a suboptimal 44% sensitivity, but 100% specificity, for multigland disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: 4D-CT demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy for single and multigland disease in our cohort. Importantly, 4D-CT accurately lateralized single-gland adenomas in >90% of cases, allowing the surgeon to employ a directed operative approach. 4D-CT also showed a very high specificity for the detection of multigland disease.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study arose from a need to systematically evaluate the clinical and angiographic outcomes of intracranial aneurysms treated with modified coils. We report the procedural safety and clinical outcomes in a prospective randomized controlled trial of endovascular coiling for ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms, comparing polymer-loaded Cerecyte coils with bare platinum coils in 23 centers worldwide.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred patients between 18 and 70 years of age with a ruptured or unruptured target aneurysm planning to undergo endovascular coiling were randomized to receive Cerecyte or bare platinum coils. Analysis was by intention to treat.
   RESULTS: Two hundred forty-nine patients were allocated to Cerecyte coils and 251 to bare platinum coils. Baseline characteristics were balanced. For ruptured aneurysms, in-hospital mortality was 2/114 (1.8%) with Cerecyte versus 0/119 (0%) bare platinum coils. There were 8 (3.4%) adverse procedural events resulting in neurological deterioration: 5/114 (4.4%) with Cerecyte versus 3/119 (2.5%) with bare platinum coils (P = .22). The 6-month mRS score of <= 2 was not significantly different in 103/109 (94.5%) patients with Cerecyte and 110/112 (98.2%) patients with bare platinum coils. Poor outcome (mRS score of >= 3 or death) was 6/109 (5.5%) with Cerecyte versus 2/112 (1.8%) with bare platinum coils (P = .0701. For UlAs, there was no in-hospital mortality. There were 7 (2.7%) adverse procedural events with neurological deterioration, 5/133 (3.8%) with Cerecyte versus 2/131 (1.5%) with bare platinum coils (P = .13). There was a 6-month mRS score of <= 2 in 114/119 (95.8%) patients with Cerecyte versus 123/123 (100%) patients with bare platinum coils. There was poor outcome (mRS >= 3 and 1 death) in 5/119 (4.2%) patients with Cerecyte versus 0/123 (0%) patients with bare platinum coils (P = .011).
   CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistical excess of poor outcomes in the Cerecyte arm at discharge in the ruptured aneurysm group and at 6-month follow-up in the unruptured group. Overall adverse clinical outcomes and in-hospital mortality were exceptionally low in both groups.

AB The purpose of the present study was to look for the possible predictors which might discriminate between high- and low-grade gliomas by pooling dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-perfusion derived indices and immunohistochemical markers.
   DCE-MRI was performed in 76 patients with different grades of gliomas. Perfusion indices, i.e., relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), permeability (k (trans) and k (ep)), and leakage (v (e)) were quantified. MMP-9-, PRL-3-, HIF-1 alpha-, and VEGF-expressing cells were quantified from the excised tumor tissues. Discriminant function analysis using these markers was used to identify discriminatory variables using a stepwise procedure. To look for correlations between immunohistochemical parameters and DCE metrics, Pearson's correlation coefficient was also used.
   A discriminant function for differentiating between high- and low-grade tumors was constructed using DCE-MRI-derived rCBV, k (ep), and v (e). The form of the functions estimated are "D (1) = 0.642 x rCBV + 0.591 x k (ep) -aEuro parts per thousand 1.501 x v (e) -aEuro parts per thousand 1.550" and "D (2) = 1.608 x rCBV + 3.033 x k (ep) + 5.508 x v (e) -aEuro parts per thousand 8.784" for low- and high-grade tumors, respectively. This function classified overall 92.1% of the cases correctly (89.1% high-grade tumors and 100% low-grade tumors). In addition, VEGF expression correlated with rCBV and rCBF, whereas MMP-9 expression correlated with k (ep). A significant positive correlation of HIF-1 alpha with rCBV and VEGF expression was also found.
   DCE-MRI may be used to differentiate between high-grade and low-grade brain tumors non-invasively, which may be helpful in appropriate treatment planning and management of these patients. The correlation of its indices with immunohistochemical markers suggests that this imaging technique is useful in tissue characterization of gliomas.

TI Long-Term Follow-Up after Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms with the

   IMPLANTATION; STENT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent-like, self-expandable devices, the so-called flow diverters, are increasingly used for the treatment of wide-neck cerebral aneurysms. The immediate and short-term results are promising, but no long-term results are available. The purpose of our research was to report the long-term angiographic and cross-sectional imaging results after placement of a PED in 12 patients with wide-neck intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve wide-neck or otherwise untreatable cerebral aneurysms in 12 patients were treated with the PED. Angiography was performed at 6 and 24 months after treatment. Additional MR and CT angiograms were acquired.
   RESULTS: In all patients, angiographic or cross-sectional imaging follow-up of at least 27 months demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysms treated with the PED. There were no cases of aneurysm recurrence. Angiography at around 6 months showed complete occlusion in all cases, except 1 that showed complete occlusion at the 29-month follow-up. In 1 patient, a clinically asymptomatic 75% in-stent stenosis was seen on the angiography at 6 months but was resolved completely by balloon dilation. Device placement was successful in all patients. Distal embolization had occurred in 1 patient, but the clot was resolved completely without clinical seguelae. Almost immediate angiographic occlusion was achieved in 2 aneurysms and flow reduction in 10 aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms by PED placement led to successful and durable occlusion in all cases, without severe complications. Endovascular treatment for in-stent stenosis should be considered cautiously, because the underlying stenosis may be transient and disappear within 12 months after treatment.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Various CTP parameters have been used to identify ischemic penumbra. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal CTP parameter and threshold to distinguish true "at-risk" penumbra from benign oligemia in acute stroke patients without reperfusion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive stroke patients were screened and 23 met the following criteria: 1) admission scanning within 9 hours of onset, 2) CTA confirmation of large vessel occlusion, 3) no late clinical or radiographic evidence of reperfusion, 4) no thrombolytic therapy, 5) DWI imaging within 3 hours of CTP, and 6) either CT or MR follow-up imaging. CTP was postprocessed with commercial software packages, using standard and delay-corrected deconvolution algorithms. Relative cerebral blood flow, volume, and mean transit time (rCBF, rCBV and rMTT) values were obtained by normalization to the uninvolved hemisphere. The admission DWI and final infarct were transposed onto the CTP maps and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine optimal thresholds for each perfusion parameter in defining penumbra destined to infarct.
   RESULTS: Relative and absolute MTT identified penumbra destined to infarct more accurately than CBF or CBV*CBF (P < .01). Absolute and relative MTT thresholds for defining penumbra were 12s and 249% for the standard and 13.5s and 150% for the delay-corrected algorithms, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Appropriately thresholded absolute and relative MTT-CTP maps optimally distinguish "at-risk" penumbra from benign oligemia in acute stroke patients with large-vessel occlusion and no reperfusion. The precise threshold values may vary, however, depending on the postprocessing technique used for CTP map construction.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuropathologic studies in experimental and human glaucoma have demonstrated degenerative changes in the optic pathway. The purpose of this study was to assess the optic pathway in POAG by using VBM and DTI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients 57.05 +/- 11.38 years of age with POAG of 8.30 +/- 5.14 years' duration and 18 control subjects underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, including quantification of the RNFLT by using Stratus OCT 3, and brain imaging. The imaging protocol consisted of a T1-weighted high-resolution 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence and a multisection spin-echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequence. Data preprocessing and analysis were performed by using Matlab 7.0 and SPM 5.
   RESULTS: Left temporal and right nasal RNFLTs were significantly thinner than right temporal and left nasal RNFLTs. In patients, VBM revealed a significant reduction in the left visual cortex volume, the left lateral geniculate nucleus, and the intracranial part of the ONs and the chiasma. In addition, a significant decrease of FA was observed in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the longitudinal and inferior frontal fasciculi, the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the anterior and posterior thalamic radiations, and the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule of the left hemisphere (P < .05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurodegenerative changes of the optic pathway and several brain areas associated with the visual system can be observed by using VBM and DTI in patients with POAG, suggesting that glaucoma is a complex neurologic disease.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The connectivity across brain regions can be evaluated through fMRI either by using (CA or by means of correlation analysis of time courses measured in predefined ROIs. The purpose of this study was to investigate quantitatively the correspondence between the connectivity information provided by the 2 techniques.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, resting-state fMRI data from 40 healthy participants were independently analyzed by using spatial (CA and ROI-based analysis. To assess the correspondence between the results provided by the 2 methods, for all combinations of ROIs, we compared the time course correlation coefficient with the corresponding "ICA coactivation index."
   RESULTS: A strongly significant correspondence of moderate intensity was found for 20 ICA components (r = 0.44, P < .001). Repeating the analysis with 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, and 40 components, we found that the correlation remained but was weaker (r = 0.35-0.41).
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant but not complete correspondence between the results provided by ICA and ROI-based analysis of resting-state data.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   The purpose of our study was aimed to analyze the sex-and age-related differences of brain metabolism in healthy individuals.
   METHODS
   Consecutive 100 healthy subjects, 50 males and 50 females, undergoing routine 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) for health checkup in our hospital were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used for analyses of the FDG PET images to disclose the possible effects of age on brain metabolism in males and females as well as the differences of brain metabolism between male and female groups.
   RESULTS
   In males and females, decreased brain metabolism with aging is found in bilateral lateral orbital prefrontal and right anterior cingulate cortices. In comparisons between sexes, males are found to have more brain metabolism than females in bilateral visual cortices and cerebellum.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Our report discloses different sex-and age-related brain metabolism. Decreased brain metabolism with aging in males and females is similar to findings reported in previous literatures. However, whether declined brain function or volume with aging causing metabolic changes is unknown and should be further evaluated. Nevertheless, the sex-related differences are possibly compatible with the historical observation of better performance in visual-spatial tasks in males than females.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Corpus callosum (CC) is frequently involved in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to investigate the relations between CC microstructure integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in relapsing-remitting MS patients with low neurological disability in comparison with age-matched healthy subjects and further to identify correlations between DTI-CC parameters and clinical variables of MS disease activity.
   METHODS
   CC volume was measured on 3.0T brain MRI by MS Analyze software. DTI metrics acquired along 31 independent directions were obtained and fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), longitudinal (lambda 1) and transverse (lambda 2, lambda 3) diffusivities were measured in MS patients and healthy subjects. Disease activity was assessed by relapse rate and neurolgical disability by the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS).
   RESULTS
   Thirty relapsing-remitting MS patients and 30 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects were studied. CC volume and DTI metrics differed significantly between MS patients and healthy subjects. In MS patients, all DTI parameters correlated with neurological disability. ADC, longitudinal and transverse diffusivity correlated with disease duration. ADC and the transverse diffusivity correlated with relapse rate.
   CONCLUSIONS
   CC DTI parameters, especially ADC and transverse diffusivity correlated with disease variables especially with those associated with clinical activity.

TI Correlations between Perfusion MR Imaging Cerebral Blood Volume,

   Analysis in Recurrent High-Grade Glioma

   DENSITY; CARCINOMA; AGENT; MAPS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantifying MVA rather than MVD provides better correlation with survival in HGG. This is attributed to a specific "glomeruloid" vascular pattern, which is better characterized by vessel area than number. Despite its prognostic value, MVA quantification is laborious and clinically impractical. The DSC-MR imaging measure of rCBV offers the advantages of speed and convenience to overcome these limitations; however, clinical use of this technique depends on establishing accurate correlations between rCBV, MVA, and MVD, particularly in the setting of heterogeneous vascular size inherent to human HGG.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained preoperative 31 DSC-MR imaging in patients with HGG before stereotactic surgery. We histologically quantified MVA, MVD, and vascular size heterogeneity from CD34-stained 10-mu m sections of stereotactic biopsies, and we coregistered biopsy locations with localized rCBV measurements. We statistically correlated rCBV, MVA, and MVD under conditions of high and low vascular-size heterogeneity and among tumor grades. We correlated all parameters with OS by using Cox regression.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 38 biopsies from 24 subjects. rCBV correlated strongly with MVA (r = 0.83, P < .0001) but weakly with MVD (r = 0.32, P = .051, due to microvessel size heterogeneity. Among samples with more homogeneous vessel size, rCBV correlation with MVD improved (r = 0.56, P = .01). OS correlated with both rCBV (P = .02) and MVA (P = .01) but not with MVD (P = .17).
   CONCLUSIONS: rCBV provides a reliable estimation of tumor MVA as a biomarker of glioma outcome. rCBV poorly estimates MVD in the presence of vessel size heterogeneity inherent to human HGG.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been proposed that autism spectrums condition may represent a form of extreme male brain (EMB), a notion supported by psychometric, behavioral, and endocrine evidence. Yet, limited data are presently available evaluating this hypothesis in terms of neuroanatomy. Here, we investigated sex-related anatomic features in adults with AS, a "pure" form of autism not involving major developmental delay.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Males and females with AS and healthy controls (n = 28 and 30, respectively) were recruited. Structural MR imaging was performed to measure overall gray and white matter volume and to assess regional effects by means of VBM. DTI was used to investigate the integrity of the main white matter tracts.
   RESULTS: Significant interactions were found between sex and diagnosis in total white matter volume, regional gray matter volume in the right parietal operculum, and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the body of the CC, cingulum, and CR. Post hoc comparisons indicated that the typical sexual dimorphism found in controls, whereby males have larger FA and total white matter volume, was absent or attenuated in participants with AS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to a fundamental role of the factors that underlie sex-specific brain differentiation in the etiology of autism.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter alteration in iNPH has not been well-investigated. TBSS is a voxelwise statistical analysis developed for DTI data. We aimed to elucidate the cerebral white matter alteration in patients with iNPH by using DTI and to test the accuracy of TBSS analysis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI data were obtained from 20 patients with iNPH and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. The FA values were evaluated by using TBSS, region-of-interest and tract-specific analysis of the CST. The accuracy of TBSS analysis was tested by using "back-projection" of TBSS results and by comparing the TBSS analysis results with those of region-of-interest and tract-specific analysis.
   RESULTS: Back-projection of the TBSS results showed accurate registration of the whole brain, with the exception of parts of the thalamus, fornix, and white matter around the posterior body of the lateral ventricle. The TBSS analysis results were consistent with those of the region-of-interest analysis and tract-specific analysis. In patients with iNPH compared with control subjects, the FA values were significantly decreased in parts of the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, and juxtacortical white matter in the frontal and parietal lobes. In contrast, FA values were significantly increased in the internal capsule, extending to the white matter in the centrum semiovale.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that patients with iNPH have various patterns of white matter damage and that TBSS analysis is a promising tool for performing accurate voxelwise statistical analysis of the iNPH brain, with the exception of misregistered areas.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI provides a sensitive measure of change in the microstructure of white matter integrity. The purpose of our study was to investigate age-related changes, sex differences, and age-by-sex interactions in white matter integrity (FA, AD, and RD) across the whole brain with a large sample.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 857 healthy subjects (mean age = 56.1 +/- 9.9 years; age range = 24.9-84.8 years) were included in this study. All subjects were scanned at 3T. With use of TBSS, we examined the effects of age and sex on FA, AD, and RD in the white matter.
   RESULTS: Global FA was negatively correlated with age (R-2 = 0.18, P < .0001), and global AD and RD were positively correlated with age (AD: R-2 = 0.02, P < .0001; RD: R-2 = 0.19, P < .0001). The correlation between age and global AD, however, was weak. Voxelwise analysis revealed a number of regions where FA was negatively correlated with age, with most of these regions showing a significant positive correlation between RD and age. There was a significant age-related FA increase in several white matter regions. Voxelwise analysis also revealed many regions where FA, AD, or RD differed between men and women; however, no region showed a significant interaction between age and sex.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that age-related changes in white matter integrity are more strongly associated with myelin sheath degeneration than with axonal degeneration, and that, in some specific regions, the number of remyelinated axons might increase with age. Our results also suggest that there are no sex differences in the aging process of the white matter.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the combined end point of partial and complete recanalization is a well-established predictor of good outcome following acute stroke intervention, few investigations have evaluated the effect of the degree of recanalization. We hypothesized that greater degrees of recanalization would be associated with a higher likelihood of favorable functional outcomes.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from MERCI and Multi MERCI prospective single-arm trials of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke were pooled. The TIMI score was used to define the degree of recanalization, and a favorable outcome was defined as an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days.
   RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were included. Age, stroke severity, and site of arterial occlusion did not differ among groups stratified by the TIMI score. The unadjusted OR for a favorable outcome increased significantly as the TIMI score increased from 0 to 1 (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.7-20.0; P = .007) and from 2 to 3 (OR. 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.5; P = .011 and the likelihood of death decreased significantly as the TIMI score increased from 2 to 3 (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.3; P = .05). In multivariate analysis, each increase in TIMI grade increased the odds of a good outcome 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.9-3.4, P < .0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Increases in the TIMI score were highly associated with improved outcomes. This finding not only provides additional evidence that restoration of blood flow improves clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke but also suggests that interventionalists should strive for complete revascularization when they provide endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke.

DT Article
ID RECONSTRUCTION; RUPTURE; ARTERY
AB Intracranial dissecting aneurysms constitute rare lesions with complex management and elevated morbidity and mortality. Results of 23 patients harboring such lesions treated with the PED are reported. Standard dual antiplatelet therapy was instituted. Neurologic and angiographic assessments were obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months. Clinical presentation included SAH (52%), symptoms of mass effect (22%), ischemia (4%), and incidental finding (22%). The posterior circulation was affected in 91% of cases. Total occlusion was demonstrated in 69.5% of patients, with an increment to 87.5% considering only patients with at least 3 months of follow-up. Small aneurysms demonstrated higher rates of total occlusion (6/7) compared with large (5/7) and giant (5/9) ones. Good clinical outcome was achieved in 74% of patients. Reconstructive endovascular treatment of intracranial dissecting aneurysms with the PED provided good clinical and angiographic results with acceptable risks, representing an attractive therapeutic option for this complex disease, especially when parent vessel preservation is mandatory.

   ISCHEMIA; INJURY; PATTERNS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Induced hypothermia is thought to work partly by mitigating reperfusion injury in asphyxiated term neonates. The purpose of this study was to assess brain perfusion in the first week of life in these neonates.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, MR imaging and ASL-PI were used to assess brain perfusion in these neonates. We measured regional CBF values on 1-2 MR images obtained during the first week of life and compared these with values obtained in control term neonates. The same or later MR imaging scans were obtained to define the extent of brain injury.
   RESULTS: Eighteen asphyxiated and 4 control term neonates were enrolled; 11 asphyxiated neonates were treated with hypothermia. Those developing brain injury despite being treated with induced hypothermia usually displayed hypoperfusion on DOL 1 and then hyperperfusion on DOL 2-3 in brain areas subsequently exhibiting injury. Asphyxiated neonates not treated with hypothermia who developed brain injury also displayed hyperperfusion on DOL 1-6 in brain areas displaying injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ASL-PI may be useful for identifying asphyxiated neonates at risk of developing brain injury, whether or not hypothermia is administered. Because hypothermia for 72 hours may not prevent brain injury when hyperperfusion is found early in the course of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, such neonates may be candidates for adjustments in their hypothermia therapy or for adjunctive neuroprotective therapies.

TI Risk Analysis of Unruptured Aneurysms Using Computational Fluid Dynamics

ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; CEREBRAL ANEURYSM; ASPECT RATIO; HEMODYNAMIC
   ANALYSIS; RUPTURE; FLOW; GEOMETRY; PATIENT; INDEX
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The decision as to the treatment of incidental As is complex. There are no certain quantitative methods that can be used to evaluate the risk of rupture in IAs. In recent years. CFD technology has been recognized as a potential risk-analysis tool. The aim of this article was to propose a hemodynamic parameter, EL, to determine the effects of stable unruptured aneurysms and of those that ruptured during the subsequent observation period.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four incidentally found ICA-PcomA aneurysms ruptured during the period of observation (ruptured-IAs). Another 26 unruptured aneurysms (stable-IAs) with similar location, size, and morphology were compared for the differences in hemodynamic factors, such as EL and WSS.
   RESULTS: The EL calculated at the ruptured-IAs was nearly 5 times higher on average than that at the stable-IAs (ruptured, 0.00374 +/- 0.0011; stable, 0.000745 +/- 0.0001 mW/mm(3), P < .001). However, there was no difference between the ruptured and stable groups according to the results of time-averaged WSS (P = .8) for ruptured- and stable-IAs. According to flow visualization, though the mean average inflow speed of ruptured-IAs was 2 times higher than that of the stable-IAs, the flow inside ruptured-IAs appeared to undergo longer resident tracks, with stronger impact on the aneurysm wall. On the contrary, the flow inside stable-IAs passed smoothly through the aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results indicated that EL may be a useful parameter for the quantitative estimation of the risks of rupture for IAs.

DT Article

   CRITERIA; TRAIL; ALS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: ALS is predominantly a disease of the motor system, but cognitive and behavioral symptoms also are observed. DT MR imaging is sensitive to microstructural changes occurring in WM tracts of patients with ALS. In this study, we investigated the association between cognitive functions and extramotor WM tract abnormalities in ALS patients.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DT MR imaging was obtained from 16 nondemented patients with ALS and 15 healthy controls. Patients with ALS underwent a neuropsychologic and behavioral evaluation. DT tractography was used to asses the integrity of the CST, corpus callosum, and the major long-range association tracts. The relationship between DT MR imaging metrics and cognitive functions was tested by using linear model analyses, adjusting for age and clinical disability.
   RESULTS: Eleven patients (69%) scored below the fifth percentile in at least 1 cognitive test, and 2 of them had a mild executive impairment. Performances at tests assessing attention and executive functions correlated with DT MR imaging metrics of the corpus callosum, CST, and long association WM tracts bilaterally, including the cingulum, inferior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital, and uncinate fasciculi. Verbal learning and memory test scores were associated with fornix DT MR imaging values, whereas visual-spatial abilities correlated with left uncinate fractional anisotropy.
   CONCLUSIONS: WM tract degeneration is associated with neuropsychologic deficits in patients with ALS. DT tractography holds promise to gain insight into the role of the brain WM network abnormalities in the development of cognitive impairment in patients with ALS.

TI Mild Cognitive Impairment: Differential Atrophy in the Hippocampal
   Subfields
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SEGMENTATION; MRI
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hippocampus volumetry is a useful surrogate marker for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, but it seems insufficiently sensitive for the aMCI stage. We postulated that some hippocampus subfields are specifically atrophic in aMCI and that measuring hippocampus subfield volumes will improve sensitivity of MR imaging to detect aMCI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated episodic memory and hippocampus subfield volume in 15 patients with aMCI and 15 matched controls. After segmentation of the whole hippocampus from clinical MR imaging, we applied a new computational method allowing fully automated segmentation of the hippocampus subfields. This method used a Bayesian modeling approach to infer segmentations from the imaging data.
   RESULTS: In comparison with controls, subiculum and CA2-3 were significantly atrophic in patients with aMCI, whereas total hippocampus volume and other subfields were not. Total hippocampus volume in controls was age-related, whereas episodic memory was the main explanatory variable for both the total hippocampus volume and the subfields that were atrophic in patients with aMCI. Segmenting subfields increases sensitivity to diagnose aMCI from 40% to 73%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Measuring CA2-3 and subiculum volumes allows a better detection of aMCI.

ID WIDE-NECKED ANEURYSMS; HEMODYNAMIC-CHANGES; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS;
   PLACEMENT; ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sterns are known to have hemodynamic and biologic effects in addition to their mechanical scaffold effect. To determine whether stents affect long-term outcomes after coiling of unruptured aneurysms, we compared angiographic outcomes at 2 years postembolization for stent- and nonstent-assisted coiled unruptured aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stent-assisted coiling was used in unruptured aneurysms unfavorable for simple coiling (neck size >4 mm and dome-to-neck ratio <1.5) in our practice. Therefore, 126 coiled unruptured aneurysms in total (40 [31.7%] stent group and 86 [68.3%] nonstent group) with these conditions were selected for this study. The nonstent group aneurysms were treated with multiple microcatheter technique (53 cases) or balloon-assisted technique (33 cases). Self-expandable stents were used for coiling in stent group aneurysms. No significant difference in aneurysmal characteristics (aneurysm type [sidewall/bifurcation], diameter, neck size, and dome-to-neck ratio) or angiographic outcome at embolization (packing attenuation, obliteration grade, and contrast filling) were observed between the 2 study groups.
   RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up visits, rates of progressive occlusion (stent group, 17/40 [42.5%] versus nonstent group, 34/86 [39.5%]) and recanalization (7/40 [17.5%] versus 18/86 [21.0%]) did not show a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .895).
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study did not show that additional hemodynamic and biologic effects of stents designed for neck remodeling were enough to enhance progressive occlusion and prevent the recanalization of unruptured aneurysms. Our finding suggests that stent placement provides no better long-term angiographic outcomes for unruptured aneurysms with an unfavorable configuration for coiling.

   CORPUS-CALLOSUM; BRAIN IMAGES; DEMENTIA; MRI
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Patients with small vessel disease show high-signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images that represent ischemic cell damage. However, despite a similar degree of ischemic change, the amount and the severity of clinical presentations may vary. We investigated the clinical correlations of ischemic changes using voxel-based morphometric analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
   METHODS
   Twenty-seven MCI and 34 dementia patients were included who all had significant small vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all patients, neuropsychological tests, a rating on the Pyramidal and Extrapyramidal scale (PEPS) for motor deficits, and 3-Tesla MRI including DTI scans were performed. Voxel-based analysis of the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were computed.
   RESULTS
   Cognitive scores correlated with the DTI abnormalities in supratentorial areas with regional specificity according to each cognitive test. Unexpectedly, cognitive deficits in most neuropsychological tests, even in some frontal tasks, were associated with disruption of posterior white matter integrities. Motor deficits correlated with both supra-and infratentorial lesions.
   CONCLUSION
   Our findings suggest that in patients with small vessel disease who show cognitive and motor impairments, a specific distribution of fiber tract damage is more related with clinical deficits than is the severity of the total ischemia.

AB High-resolution MR imaging of peripheral nerves is becoming more common and practical with the increasing availability of 3T magnets. There are multiple reports of MR imaging of peripheral nerves in compression and entrapment neuropathies. However, there is a relative paucity of literature on MRN appearance of diffuse peripheral nerve lesions. We attempted to highlight the salient imaging features of myriad diffuse peripheral nerve disorders and imaging techniques for MAN. Using clinical and pathologically proved relevant examples, we present the MRN appearance of various types of diffuse peripheral nerve lesions, such as traumatic, inflammatory, infectious, hereditary, radiation-induced, neoplastic, and tumor variants.

TI Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders: Spectrum of Neuroimaging
   Findings in 75 Patients
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

ID FEATURES
AB VH and MIS are the neuroimaging hallmarks of JSRD. We aimed to look at the full spectrum of neuroimaging findings in JSRD and reviewed the MR imaging of 75 patients with JSRD, including 13 siblings and 4 patients with OFD VI. All patients had VH and enlargement of the fourth ventricle. The degree of VH and the form of the MTS were variable. In most patients, the cerebellar hemispheres were normal and the PF was enlarged. Brain stem morphology was abnormal in 30% of the patients. Supratentorial findings included hippocampal malrotation, callosal dysgenesis, migration disorders, cephaloceles, and ventriculomegaly. All patients with OFD VI had a similar pattern, including HH in 2 patients. No neuroimaging-genotype correlation could be found. The wide neuroimaging spectrum in our patients supports the heterogeneity of JSRD. Neuroimaging differences in siblings represent intrafamilial heterogeneity. Due to the absence of a correlation with genotype, neuroimaging findings are of limited value in classifying patients with JSRD.

   LESSONS; DECADE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CTP imaging in the interventional suite could reduce delays to the start of image-guided interventions and help determine the treatment progress and end point. However, C-arms rotate slower than clinical CT scanners, making CTP challenging. We developed a cerebral CTP protocol for C-arm CBCT and evaluated it in an animal study.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five anesthetized swine were imaged by using C-arm CBCT and conventional CT. The C-arm rotates in 4.3 seconds plus a 1.25-second turnaround, compared with 0.5 seconds for clinical CT. Each C-arm scan had 6 continuous bidirectional sweeps. Multiple scans each with a different delay to the start of an aortic arch iodinated contrast injection and a novel image reconstruction algorithm were used to increase temporal resolution. Three different scan sets (consisting of 6, 3, or 2 scans) and 3 injection protocols (3-mL/s 100%, 3-mL/s 67%, and 6-mL/s 50% contrast concentration) were studied. CBF maps for each scan set and injection were generated. The concordance and Pearson correlation coefficients (rho and r) were calculated to determine the injection providing the best match between the following: the left and right hemispheres, and CT and C-arm CBCT.
   RESULTS: The highest rho and r values (both 0.92) for the left and right hemispheres were obtained by using the 6-mL 50% iodinated contrast concentration injection. The same injection gave the best match for CT and C-arm CBCT for the 6-scan set (rho = 0.77, r = 0.89). Some of the 3-scan and 2-scan protocols provided matches similar to those in CT.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that C-arm CBCT can produce CBF maps that correlate well with those from CTP.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent-assisted endovascular treatment and flow diversion techniques are increasingly used for the management of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. We report our initial clinical experience using a new flow diversion technique for the endovascular management of bifurcation aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight bifurcation aneurysms were treated by placing 2 stents in Y-configuration with no accompanying endosaccular packing. This treatment technique aimed at flow diversion was selected in these cases because 1 I the aneurysm was giant and causing mass effect, 21 the emanating branches were incorporated within the sac, or 3) the aneurysm was too small. Aneurysms were located at middle cerebral 15 aneurysms) and basilar artery bifurcations (3 aneurysms). Five aneurysms were small, 1 was large, and 2 were partially thrombosed giant. Closed-cell stents were used in all Y-stent placement procedures
   RESULTS: In all aneurysms, both stents could be placed at the intended locations without any procedural complication. Follow-up angiograms obtained at 3 months to 2 years demonstrated that all stents were patent except for one with asymptomatic P1 occlusion. Complete occlusion with remodelled bifurcation was observed in all middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysms and the large basilar tip aneurysm. Residual filling despite reduction in size was observed in both of the partially thrombosed giant aneurysms at 2-year and 3-month follow-up angiograms, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flow diversion with double stent placement in Y-configuration provided successful and stable aneurysm occlusion. The technical and clinical results achieved are highly encouraging that this technique may contribute to the endovascular treatment of these complex bifurcation aneurysms.

AB The Woven Endobridge (WEB II) device (Sequent Medical, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) is an intra-saccular, oblate, braided-wire embolization device designed to provide flow disruption at the aneurysm neck-parent artery interface. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute and short-term performance of the WEB II device regarding the immediacy, degree, and durability of aneurysm occlusion in two patients.
   The WEB II device was implanted in one patient with an unruptured MCA trifurcation aneurysm and one patient with an unruptured basilar tip aneurysm. The degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption was graded based on serial digital subtraction aneurysm angiography performed over 30 min immediately following device implantation and at 8 weeks. Immediate and 8-week post-treatment CT and 3-T MRI studies were also performed.
   Delivery and deployment of the WEB II device was technically straightforward and achieved without complications. Neither device required retrieval or repositioning after full deployment. There were no peri-procedural thrombembolic or hemorrhagic complications. In both cases, complete aneurysm occlusion was observed within minutes of device deployment. Short-term angiographic follow-up confirmed stable complete occlusion at 8 weeks.
   Early technical and clinical results from the first WEB II cases have been encouraging and suggest that the intra-saccular deployment of self-expanding, compliant, cylindrical, high-density, braided metallic mesh constructs may represent a feasible approach for the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms.

AB Flow diverter (FD) devices have emerged as an alternative treatment for a subgroup of intracranial aneurysms. The principle of endovascular flow diversion is inherently different from endosaccular coil embolisation. To monitor the angiographic outcomes for FDs, a sensitive and reliable new measure is required. Oxford Neurovascular and Neuroradiology Research Unit developed a grading schema while conducting a registry to audit outcomes of patients treated using a particular FD (SILK flow diverter; Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France). The aim of this study is to assess the applicability and reproducibility of the new schema.
   The proposed grading schema is designed for saccular- or fusiform-shaped aneurysms. For both, it documents the degree of aneurysm occlusion using a five-point scale and the parent artery patency on a three-point scale. Two neuroradiologists used the schema to independently rate 55 angiograms showing comparable treatment and follow-up angiograms of patients treated with a FD. Inter-observer agreement was estimated using the weighted kappa co-efficient.
   Both readers found the schema easy to apply. Overall, there were ten discordant readings for degrees of aneurysm occlusion and two for parent artery patency. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for both the assessment of aneurysm occlusion (k=0.89; C.I.=0.81-0.99) and parent artery patency (k=0.90; C.I.=0.76-1.0).
   The proposed schema is sufficiently sensitive to register gradual aneurysm occlusion and parent artery patency on interval angiograms. It is reproducible and is applicable to both saccular and fusiform aneurysms. More data on follow-up of FD-treated aneurysms is needed to prove its efficacy in predicting the long-term behaviour of treated aneurysms.

   ABNORMALITIES; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; GREY-MATTER; WHITE-MATTER;
   VOLUME; METAANALYSIS; MRI; CEREBELLUM
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Imaging studies of patients with schizophrenia have described a variety of cerebral alterations. However, long-term medication and the chronicity of the disorder may have contributed substantially to these alterations. Studies examining patients in the early stages of the disorder reduce the possibility of such confounding factors but are rare. In light of this, the aim of the present study was to examine adolescents in the early stages of the disorder to observe primary structural brain abnormalities.
   METHODS
   Gray and white matter were measured in 13 adolescents with schizophrenia and 13 healthy controls matched for age, gender, handedness, and school type using voxel-based morphometry.
   RESULTS
   Subjects with schizophrenia displayed decreased gray matter in the cerebellar vermis, and alterations in the left putamen and in several parts of the visual system.
   CONCLUSIONS
   These findings support cerebellar involvement in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and the alterations observed in several parts of the visual system may provide insights into the nature of hallucinations and delusional interpretations.

   RISK-FACTORS; 7.0 T; PREVALENCE; ASSOCIATIONS; ANGIOGRAPHY; POPULATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The detection of microbleeds differs strongly between studies, due to differences in scan protocol. This study aims to compare the visualization of microbleeds with 3D T2*-weighted imaging at 1.5T with 3D dual-echo T2*-weighted imaging at 7T.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients (29 male; mean age, 58 +/- 12 years) with atherosclerotic disease from the Second Manifestations of ARTerial Disease study were included. 3D T2*-weighted imaging at 1.5T and dual-echo T2*-weighted imaging at 7T were done in all patients. The presence and number of definite microbleeds were recorded on minimal intensity projections. Inter- and intraobserver reliability was assessed with Cohen kappa test and the ICC. The difference in presence and number of microbleeds was tested with the McNemar test and Wilcoxon signed rank test.
   RESULTS: The interobserver ICC at 7T was 0.61 and the intraobserver ICC was 0.94, whereas at 1.5T the interobserver ICC was 0.50 and the intraobserver ICC was 0.59. Microbleeds were detected in significantly more patients on 7T (50%) than on 1.5T scans (21%) (P = .001). The number of microbleeds was also higher at 7T (median, 0.5; range, 0-5) than on 1.5T (median, 0.0; range, 0-6) (P=.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: 3D dual-echo T2*-weighted imaging at 7T results in better and more reliable detection of microbleeds compared with 3D T2*-weighted imaging at 1.5T.

   LOCATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early prediction of motor outcome is of interest in stroke management. We aimed to determine whether lesion location at DTT is predictive of motor outcome after acute stroke and whether this information improves the predictive accuracy of the clinical scores.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 60 consecutive patients within 12 hours of middle cerebral artery stroke onset. We used DTT to evaluate CST involvement in the motor cortex and premotor cortex, centrum semiovale, corona radiate, and PLIC and in combinations of these regions at admission, at day 3, and at day 30. Severity of limb weakness was assessed by using the motor subindex scores of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (5a, 5b, 6a, 6b). We calculated volumes of infarct and fractional anisotropy values in the CST of the pons.
   RESULTS: Acute damage to the PLIC was the best predictor associated with poor motor outcome, axonal damage, and clinical severity at admission (P <.001). There was no significant correlation between acute infarct volume and motor outcome at day 90 (P = .176, r = 0.485). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of acute CST involvement at the level of the PLIC for motor outcome at day 90 were 73.7%, 100%, 100%, and 89.1%, respectively. In the acute stage, DTT predicted motor outcome at day 90 better than the clinical scores (R(2) = 75.50, F = 80.09, P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In the acute setting, DTT is promising for stroke mapping to predict motor outcome. Acute CST damage at the level of the PLIC is a significant predictor of unfavorable motor outcome.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fatigue affects up to 90% of patients with MS. We assessed the regional distribution of lesions and atrophy of the normal-appearing WM and GM in patients with ARMS with fatigue compared with HC and patients with similar characteristics, but without fatigue.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 14 patients with RRMS without fatigue, 10 with RAMS with fatigue, and 14 HC, we acquired brain dual-echo and high-resolution T1-weighted scans. Voxel-wise distributions of GM, WM damage, and T2 lesions were compared between patients with fatigued and nonfatigued MS by using SPM5 software. We report results at P < .05, FWE corrected.
   RESULTS: T2 lesion distribution and regional WM atrophy did not differ between patients with fatigued and nonfatigued MS. Compared with HC, patients with MS had significant WM atrophy in the posterior part of the corpus callosum and significant GM atrophy of the left superior frontal sulcus, left precentral gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, right thalamus, and left middle frontal gyrus. No additional areas of atrophy were found in patients with nonfatigued MS compared with HC, whereas patients with fatigued MS also had atrophy of the left central sulcus. Atrophy in the left central sulcus and the precentral gyrus was more severe in patients with fatigued versus nonfatigued MS. In patients with MS, significant correlations were found between fatigue severity and GM atrophy in the left precentral gyrus (r = 0.73, P < .0001 uncorrected).
   CONCLUSIONS: Atrophy of the primary sensorimotor area is likely to contribute to MS-related fatigue.

AB Conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has limited capacity to differentiate between glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and metastasis. The purposes of this study were: (1) to compare microvascular leakage (MVL), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and blood flow (CBF) in the distinction of metastasis from GBM using dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging (DSC-MRI), and (2) to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of perfusion and permeability MR imaging.
   A prospective study of 61 patients (40 GBMs and 21 metastases) was performed at 3 T using DSC-MRI. Normalized rCBV and rCBF from tumoral (rCBVt, rCBFt), peri-enhancing region (rCBVe, rCBFe), and by dividing the value in the tumor by the value in the peri-enhancing region (rCBVt/e, rCBFt/e), as well as MVL were calculated. Hemodynamic and histopathologic variables were analyzed statistically and Spearman/Pearson correlations. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for each of the variables.
   The rCBVe, rCBFe, and MVL were significantly greater in GBMs compared with those of metastases. The optimal cutoff value for differentiating GBM from metastasis was 0.80 which implies a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 92%, a positive predictive value of 86%, and a negative predictive value of 97% for rCBVe ratio. We found a modest correlation between rCBVt and rCBFt ratios.
   MVL measurements in GBMs are significantly higher than those in metastases. Statistically, both rCBVe, rCBVt/e and rCBFe, rCBFt/e were useful in differentiating between GBMs and metastases, supporting the hypothesis that perfusion MR imaging can detect infiltration of tumor cells in the peri-enhancing region.

TI Association of Olfactory Bulb Volume and Olfactory Sulcus Depth with
   Olfactory Function in Patients with Parkinson Disease
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DYSFUNCTION; PATHOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Olfactory dysfunction is commonly associated with IPD. We here report the association of OB volume and OS depth with olfactory function in patients with PD.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morphometric analyses by using MR imaging and the Japanese T&T olfactometer threshold test were used to evaluate olfactory structure and function in 29 patients with PD and 29 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
   RESULTS: The olfactory recognition thresholds were significantly higher in patients with PD than in healthy controls (3.82 +/- 1.25 versus 0.45 +/- 0.65, P<.001). Olfactory atrophy with reductions in the volume of the OB (37.30 +/- 10.23 mm(3) versus 44.87 +/- 11.84 mm(3), P<.05) and in the depth of OS (8.90 +/- 1.42 mm versus 9.67 +/- 1.24 mm, P<.05) was observed in patients with PD but not in controls. Positive correlations between olfactory performance and OB volumes were observed in both patients with PD (r=0.45, P<.0001) and in controls (r=0.42, P<.0001). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the depth of OS and olfactory function in either cohort.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that early olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD may be a primary consequence of damage to the OB. Neuroimaging of olfactory structures together with the assessment of olfactory function may be used to identify patients with PD.

   GANGLIA; BRAIN; DEMENTIA; DISEASE; DILATATION; CAVITIES; SILENT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: dVRS have been previously associated with aging and cerebrovascular diseases. However, little is known about their prevalence and topographic distribution in the general elderly population.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: dVRS were evaluated by using high-resolution 3D MR imaging in 1826 subjects enrolled in the 3C-Dijon MR imaging study. On T1-weighted MR imaging, dVRS were detected according to 3D imaging criteria and rated by using 4-level severity scores based in the BG or in the WM. The number and anatomic location of large dVRS (>= 3 mm) were recorded.
   RESULTS: dVRS were observed in the BG or WM in every subject. The severity of dVRS was significantly associated with higher age in both the BG and WM, whereas sex was related to the severity of dVRS only in the BG. Large dVRS were detected in 33.2% of participants. Status cribrosum was found in 1.3% of participants. dVRS were also highly prevalent within the hippocampus (44.5%) and hypothalamus (11.6%).
   CONCLUSIONS: dVRS are always detected in the BG or WM in elderly people, and large dVRS are also prevalent. The topographic distribution of dVRS is not uniform within the brain and may depend on anatomic or pathologic characteristics interacting with aging and sex.

TI Endovascular Treatment Using Predominantly Stent-Assisted Coil
   Embolization and Antiplatelet and Anticoagulation Management of Ruptured
   Blood Blister-Like Aneurysms
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNAL CAROTID-ARTERY; NONBRANCHING SITES; RECONSTRUCTION; WALL
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: BBA is a rare type of intracranial aneurysm that is difficult to treat both surgically and endovascularly and is often associated with a high degree of morbidity/mortality. The aim of this study was to present clinical and angiographic results, as well as antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimens, of endovascular BBA treatment by using predominantly stent-assisted coil embolization.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients (men/women, 6/7; mean age, 49.3 years) with ruptured BBAs were included from 2 different institutions. Angiographic findings, treatment strategies, anticoagulation/antiplatelet protocols, and clinical (mRS) and angiographic outcome were retrospectively analyzed.
   RESULTS: Eleven BBAs were located in the supraclinoid ICA, and 2 on the basilar artery trunk. Nine of 13 were <= 3 mm in the largest diameter, and 8/13 showed early growth before treatment. Primary stent-assisted coiling was performed in 11/13 patients, double stents and PAD in 1 patient, each. Early complementary treatment was required in 3 patients, including PAD in 2. In stent-placement procedures, altered periprocedural antiplatelet (11/12) and postprocedural heparin (6/12) protocols were used without evidence of thromboembolic events. Two patients had early rehemorrhage, including 1 major fatal SAH. Twelve of 13 BBAs showed complete or progressive occlusion at late angiographic follow-up. Clinical midterm outcome was good (mRS scores, 0-2) in 12/13 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coiling of ruptured BBAs is technically challenging but can be done with good midterm results. Reduced periprocedural and postprocedural antiplatelet/anticoagulation protocols may be used with a low reasonable risk of thromboembolic complications. However, regrowth/rerupture remains a problem underlining the importance of early angiographic follow-up and retreatment, including PAD if necessary.

AB PURPOSE
   At present, no time recommendation for initiation of endovascular treatment in acute ischemic stroke is available. A multicenter analysis was designed to identify variables that prolong "time to microcatheter," defined as the time interval from computed tomographic scan to microcatheter placement in the cerebral circulation.
   METHODS
   Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients from 3 academic stroke centers were included. Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate different variables that prolong "time to microcatheter."
   RESULTS
   Ninety-one patients underwent emergent endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Mean "time to microcatheter" was 174 +/- 60 minutes. No significant time difference was found in patients who were intubated, presented at night or weekends, were administered intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or underwent additional imaging prior to endovascular treatment. "Time to microcatheter" was significantly longer in nonlevel I trauma centers and in patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of 10 to 19.
   CONCLUSION
   Wide variability of "time to microcatheter" among institutions highlights the need for standardized time goals.

AB PURPOSE
   To detect diffusion abnormalities in the trigeminal nerves of patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) caused by neurovascular compression (NVC) by using a high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (HR-DTI) technique.
   METHODS
   Thirteen patients with TN and 14 healthy controls underwent HR-DTI scanning. After extracting the trigeminal nerve using a tractography technique, we measured the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and compared the contralateral ratios (CR) of these parameters between the patients and controls, and correlated these ratios with the cross-sectional areas of the nerves.
   RESULTS
   The CRs of the FA values for the trigeminal nerves of the patients (1.00 +/- 0.15) had significantly higher variance than those of healthy controls (1.00 +/- 0.05) (P < .05) and showed a positive correlation with the cross-sectional area of the nerves (r = 0.81). In contrast, the CRs of the ADC values were not significantly different between the two groups (1.02 +/- 0.10 and 1.01 +/- 0.08, respectively) and had no significant correlation with cross-sectional area.
   CONCLUSION
   HR-DTI can detect an alteration in the relative FA values of affected trigeminal nerves and a correlation with atrophic changes in patients with NVC-induced TN.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dysfunction of DA neurotransmission from the SN and VIA has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, including Parkinson disease and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, these midbrain DA structures are difficult to define on clinical MR imaging. To more precisely evaluate the anatomic architecture of the DA midbrain, we scanned healthy participants with a 7T MR imaging system. Here we contrast the performance of high-resolution T2- and T2*-weighted GRASE and FEE MR imaging scans at 7T.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy participants were scanned by using GRASE and FEE sequences. CNRs were calculated among the SN, VTA, and RN, and their volumes were estimated by using a segmentation algorithm.
   RESULTS: Both GRASE and FFE scans revealed visible contrast between midbrain DA regions. The GRASE scan showed higher CNRs compared with the FFE scan. The T2* contrast of the FEE scan further delineated substructures and microvasculature within the midbrain SN and RN. Segmentation and volume estimation of the midbrain SN, RN, and VTA showed individual differences in the size and volume of these structures across participants.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both GRASE and FFE provide sufficient CNR to evaluate the anatomy of the midbrain DA system. The FEE in particular reveals vascular details and substructure information within the midbrain regions that could be useful for examining structural changes in midbrain pathologies.

AB Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS) is a sporadic disease of unknown etiology with typical onset in childhood or in young adults. It is characterized by a slow and progressive atrophy affecting one side of the face, the skin, the subcutaneous tissue, the muscles, the cartilages, and the underlying bony structures. The neurological symptoms usually include focal epilepsy, migraine, and unilateral brain lesions on the same side as the atrophy. A common neuroimaging finding of the syndrome is white matter high signal intensity on brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
   Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare and chronic inflammatory disease of the brain that begins in the first decade of life and more rarely in adolescents and adults. It usually involves one hemisphere with focal cortical inflammation. Neurologic symptoms are intractable seizures and progressive hemiplegia.
   Both PRS and RE are often associated with other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders and only 1 case of both syndromes has been reported in literature.
   We report the clinical and neuroradiological findings in a 6-year-old boy, presenting with focal hemifacial and arm motor seizures and progressive facial hemiatrophy. Serial MR imaging studies revealed progressive brain hemispheric signal alterations and atrophy. This would thus suggest acoexistence of PRS and RE.

TI Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Optic Tracts in Multiple Sclerosis:
   Association with Retinal Thinning and Visual Disability
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING

   NEURITIS; DAMAGE; DYSFUNCTION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Visual disability is common in multiple sclerosis, but its relationship to abnormalities of the optic tracts remains unknown. Because they are only rarely affected by lesions, the optic tracts may represent a good model for assessing the imaging properties of normal-appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis.
   METHODS
   Whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging was performed on 34 individuals with multiple sclerosis and 26 healthy volunteers. The optic tracts were reconstructed by tractography, and tract-specific diffusion indices were quantified. In the multiple-sclerosis group, peripapillary retinal nerve-fiber-layer thickness and total macular volume were measured by optical coherence tomography, and visual acuity at 100%, 2.5%, and 1.25% contrast was examined.
   RESULTS
   After adjusting for age and sex, optic-tract mean and perpendicular diffusivity were higher (P = .002) in multiple sclerosis. Lower optic-tract fractional anisotropy was correlated with retinal nerve-fiber-layer thinning (r = .51, P = .003) and total-macular-volume reduction (r = .59, P = .002). However, optic-tract diffusion indices were not specifically correlated with visual acuity or with their counterparts in the optic radiation.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Optic-tract diffusion abnormalities are associated with retinal damage, suggesting that both may be related to optic-nerve injury, but do not appear to contribute strongly to visual disability in multiple sclerosis.

TI Hemodynamics of Cerebral Aneurysm Initiation: The Role of Wall Shear
   Stress and Spatial Wall Shear Stress Gradient
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; COMPLEX HEMODYNAMICS; FLOW; MODELS; ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral aneurysms are preferentially located at arterial curvatures and bifurcations that are exposed to major hemodynamic forces, increasingly implicated in the life cycle of aneurysms. By observing the natural history of aneurysm formation from its preaneurysm state, we aimed to examine the hemodynamic microenvironment related to aneurysm initiation at certain arterial segments later developing an aneurysm.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3 patients included in the study underwent cerebral angiography with 3D reconstruction before a true aneurysm developed. The arterial geometries obtained from the 3D-DSA models were used for flow simulation by using finite-volume modeling. The WSS and SWSSG at the site of the future aneurysm and the flow characteristics of the developed aneurysms were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The analyzed regions of interest demonstrated significantly increased WSS, accompanied by an increased positive SWSSG in the adjacent proximal region. The WSS reached values of >5 times the temporal average values of the parent vessel, whereas the SWSSG approximated or exceeded peaks of 40 Pa/mm in all 3 cases. All patients developed an aneurysm within 2 years, 1 of which ruptured.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this hemodynamic study, in accordance with the clinical follow-up, suggest that the combination of high WSS and high positive SWSSG focused on a small segment of the arterial wall may have a role in the initiation process of aneurysm formation.

ID FREQUENCY BOLD FLUCTUATIONS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; DEFAULT-MODE; HUMAN
   BRAIN; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; AUTISM; SCHIZOPHRENIA; FMRI;
   UNDERCONNECTIVITY; CORTEX
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Measurements of resting-state functional connectivity have increasingly been used for characterization of neuropathologic and neurodevelopmental populations. We collected data to characterize how much imaging time is necessary to obtain reproducible quantitative functional connectivity measurements needed for a reliable single-subject diagnostic test.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained 100 five-minute BOLD scans on a single subject, divided into 10 sessions of 10 scans each, with the subject at rest or while watching video clips of cartoons. These data were compared with resting-state BOLD scans from 36 healthy control subjects by evaluating the correlation between each pair of 64 small spheric regions of interest obtained from a published functional brain parcellation.
   RESULTS: Single-subject and group data converged to reliable estimates of individual and population connectivity values proportional to 1 / sqrt(n). Dramatic improvements in reliability were seen by using <= 25 minutes of imaging time, with smaller improvements for additional time. Functional connectivity "fingerprints" for the individual and population began diverging at approximately 15 minutes of imaging time, with increasing reliability even at 4 hours of imaging time. Twenty-five minutes of BOLD imaging time was required before any individual connections could reliably discriminate an individual from a group of healthy control subjects. A classifier discriminating scans during which our subject was resting or watching cartoons was 95% accurate at 10 minutes and 100% accurate at 15 minutes of imaging time.
   CONCLUSIONS: An individual subject and control population converged to reliable different functional connectivity profiles that were task-modulated and could be discriminated with sufficient imaging time.

   COILS; FOLLOW-UP; NEUROFORM STENT; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; TRIAL ISAT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical outcome and initial and midterm angiographic results of EVT of complex MCA aneurysms by using the stent-assisted coiling technique were retrospectively evaluated in our center where EVT of intracranial aneurysms is the first treatment option.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2003 to October 2009, 49 patients (27 men, 22 women; mean age, 52 +/- 12 years) harboring 52 complex unruptured MCA aneurysms (11 ruptured previously and coiled but recanalized and 41 unruptured) were treated by EVT by using self-expandable intracranial stents. Procedural complications, clinical outcome, and initial and midterm angiograpihic results were evaluated. Initial treatment status and aneurysm sac size were tested as potential risk factors for recurrence.
   RESULTS: After successful stent deployment, coiling was performed in 50 aneurysms (96.2%) in 47 patients; however, 2 failures (3.8%) occurred in 2 patients. Ten intrastent clot formations (20%) observed on final control angiography induced 2 permanent moderate disabilities (GOS score = 2). Mortality and permanent neurologic morbidity were 0% and 4.3%, respectively. At a mean period of 14 +/- 9 months, among 48 aneurysms in 45 patients eligible for follow-up, 34 complete (71%) and 14 partial treatments (29%) were observed, 7 recurrences (14.6%) occurred, and 5 patients (10.4%) needed retreatment. No aneurysm bleeding or symptomatic intrastent stenosis was observed. Aneurysm sac size >= 7 mm and incomplete initial treatment were associated with more recurrences without a statistically significant difference.
   CONCLUSIONS: For complex unruptured MCA aneurysms, EVT by using a self-expandable intracranial stent was feasible, safe, and durable and could be considered as the first-option treatment.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tumor angiogenesis is very heterogeneous and in vivo correlation of perfusion imaging parameters with angiogenic markers can help in better understanding the role of perfusion imaging as an imaging biomarker. The purpose of this study was to correlate PCT parameters such as CBV and PS with histologic and molecular angiogenic markers in gliomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six image-guided biopsy specimens in 23 patients with treatment-naive gliomas underwent PCT examinations. We correlated MVD, MVCP, VEGFR-2 expression, tumor cellularity, and WHO grade of the image-guided biopsy specimens with the PCT parameters. Histologic sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, CD34, and VEGFR-2 and examined under a light microscope. These histologic and molecular angiogenic markers were correlated with perfusion parameters of the region of interest corresponding to the biopsy specimen. Pearson correlation coefficients and multiple regression analyses by using clustering methods were performed to assess these correlations.
   RESULTS: CBV showed a significant positive correlation with MVD (r = 0.596, P < .001), whereas PS showed a significant positive correlation with MVCP (r = 0.546, P = .0011. Both CBV (r = 0.373, P = .031) and PS (r = 0.452, P = .039) also showed a significant correlation with WHO grade. VEGFR-2 positive specimens showed higher PS and CBV; however, neither was statistically significant at the .05 level.
   CONCLUSIONS: CBV showed a significant positive correlation with MVD, whereas PS showed a significant positive correlation with MVCP, suggesting that these 2 perfusion parameters represent different aspects of tumor vessels; hence, in vivo evaluation of these could be important in a better understanding of tumor angiogenesis.

TI Direct Thrombus Retrieval Using the Reperfusion Catheter of the Penumbra
   System: Forced-Suction Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RECANALIZATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the PS has been the most promising mechanical thrombectomy device in terms of recanalization rates, even the PS cannot recanalize all cases of occlusion. Under such circumstances, we simply modified the PS, identified certain advantages, and applied this modification as a primary technique for recanalization. Here we describe and discuss the technical details and results of our preliminary experience.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 22 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to large-artery occlusion who underwent modified thrombectomy by using the PS for recanalization. Direct wedging between the tip of the reperfusion catheter and the proximal part of the clot followed by forceful suction by using a 20- or 50-mL syringe is a unique feature of this technique. What is distinctive is that this does not require use of a separator or aspiration pump.
   RESULTS: All treated vessels (100%) were successfully recanalized. A TICI scale of 2b or 3 was achieved in 81.9% of patients. A 3-month favorable functional outcome (mRS score, 0-2) was achieved in 45.5% of patients. The only procedural complication was a transient dissection of the proximal ICA, which developed while advancing the guide catheter.
   CONCLUSIONS: Forced-suction thrombectomy is a simple modification of the PS. On the basis of our data, this technique allows safe and effective revascularization in acute large-vessel occlusion. Thus, for achieving the best outcome, the modified PS technique is proposed as a viable option for acute stroke management, either by itself or in conjunction with other devices or drugs.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CTA-SI have been previously reported to correlate with CBV. We hypothesized that CTA-SI performed by modern multisection CT scanners are CBF-, not CBV-weighted.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive patients with anterior circulation stroke symptoms were selected from a stroke data base between June 2007 and January 2009. Two independent blinded readers calculated defect volumes of CTA-SI and PCCT, CBF, and CBV images. Spearman correlation of lesion volumes was performed. Linear regression and residual analysis demonstrated factors associated with outliers for CTA or PCCT for CBF and CBV volumes.
   RESULTS: We found a strong positive correlation between CIA with CBF (r = 0.89, P < .0001) and between PCCT and CBV (r = 0.79, P < .0001). CIA to CBV (r = 0.5, P < .0001) and PCCT to CBF (r = 0.52, P < .0001) correlations were weaker. Positive CIA outliers had lower ASPECTS (P = .01), larger baseline CIA (149 +/- 46 cm(3) versus 83 +/- 32 cm(3); P = .002, respectively), and final infarct (190 +/- 100 cm(3) versus 80 +/- 50 cm(3); P = .09, respectively) volumes than nonoutliers. No baseline features were significantly related to PCCT outliers. There was no difference in the vessel occlusion sites for positive or negative outliers for CIA or PCCT (P = .55 and P = 1.00, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CIA-SI are CBF- rather than CBV-weighted.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Methylation of the MGMT gene promoter is associated with a favorable prognosis in adult patients with GBM treated with TMZ. We determined the incidence of pseudoprogression according to the MGMT methylation status and the potential value of DSC perfusion MR images for predicting pseudoprogression.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: New or enlarged enhancing lesions after CCRT in adult patients with newly diagnosed GBMs were prospectively assessed by measuring their rCBV by using DSC perfusion MR images. Tumor tissue was assayed to determine MGMT promoter methylation status. All patients were regularly followed up at an interval of 2 months by MR images, including DSC perfusion MR images.
   RESULTS: Ninety eligible patients were enrolled in this study. After CCRT, new or enlarged enhanced lesions were found in 59 of 90 patients, which were subsequently classified as pseudoprogression (26 patients, 28.9%) and real progression (33 patients, 36.7%). Overall, there was a significant difference in the mean rCBV between pseudoprogression and real tumor progression (P = .003). The ROC curve revealed that an rCBV ratio >1.47 had an 81.5% sensitivity and a 77.8% specificity. The unmethylated MGMT promoter group had a significant difference of mean rCBV between pseudoprogression and real progression (P = .009), though the methylated MGMT promoter group had no significant difference (P = .258).
   CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that rCBV measured by DSC perfusion MR images has a differential impact on the predictability of pseudoprogression in patients with GBM.

TI Detection and Classification of Cranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas

LA English
DT Article
ID DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL-ANGIOGRAPHY; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE;
   NATURAL-HISTORY; CT ANGIOGRAPHY; MALFORMATIONS; COMPLICATIONS; ANEURYSM
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The criterion standard to diagnose and classify cranial DAVFs is DSA. Since this is invasive, relatively expensive and time-consuming, a noninvasive alternative is of interest. We aimed to evaluate the capabilities and pitfalls of 4D-CTA in a consecutive series of patients who presented with a newly diagnosed cranial DAVF, as demonstrated by conventional DSA.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients were included in this study after biplane DSA demonstrated a cranial DAVF. They subsequently underwent 4D-CTA imaging by using a 320-detector CT scanner. DSA and 4D-CTA studies were independently read by 2 blinded observers, by using a standardized scoring sheet. 4D-CTA results were analyzed with DSA as the criterion standard.
   RESULTS: In 10 cases, there was full agreement between DSA and 4D-CTA regarding the Borden classification. However, in the remaining patient, a slow-filling DAVF with a low shunt volume was missed by both readers on 4D-CTA. In all 10 detected cases, >= 1 of the major contributing arteries could be identified with 4D-CTA. Although, by using DSA, the 2 observers identified additional arterial feeders in 7 and 8 cases, respectively, these discrepancies did not influence clinical decision making.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although novel 4D-CTA imaging may not rule out a small slow-flow DAVF, it appears to be a valuable new adjunct in the noninvasive diagnostic work-up, treatment planning, and follow-up of patients with cranial DAVFs.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI is an MR imaging measure of brain tissue integrity and provides an attractive metric for use in neuroprotection clinical trials. The purpose of our study was to use DTI to evaluate the longitudinal changes in brain tissue integrity in a group of patients with MS.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with MS starting natalizumab were imaged serially for 12 months. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions and 20 regions of interest from normal-appearing white and gray matter brain tissue were followed longitudinally. Average values within each region of interest were derived for FA, lambda(parallel to), lambda(perpendicular to), and MD. New T1 black holes were identified at 12 months. Analysis was performed by using mixed-model regression analysis with slope (ie, DTI change per month) as the dependent variable.
   RESULTS: During 1 year, FA increased in gadolinium-enhancing lesions but decreased in NABT (P < .0001 for both). Changes in FA within gadolinium-enhancing lesions were driven by decreased lambda(perpendicular to) (P < .001), and within NABT, by decreased lambda(parallel to) (P < .0001). A higher lambda(perpendicular to) within gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline predicted conversion to T1 black holes at 12 months. MD was unchanged in both gadolinium-enhancing lesions and NABT.
   CONCLUSIONS: We observed changes in DTI measures during 1 year in both gadolinium-enhancing lesions and NABT. The DTI results may represent possible remyelination within acute lesions and chronic axonal degeneration in NAWM. These results support the use of DTI as a measure of tissue integrity for studies of neuroprotective therapies.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With modern imaging techniques, visualization of neurovascular stents remains challenging. We present a method for contrast-enhanced C-arm CBCT that provides detailed and simultaneous visualization of neurovascular stents and host arteries.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: CBCT was performed with a rotational angiography system by acquiring 620 projection frames over a 200 degrees arc at 80 kVp and a total of 260 mAs. A superselective intra-arterial contrast injection protocol was optimized in swine experiments and implemented in 57 clinical examinations. High-resolution 3D reconstructions were evaluated by 3 blinded interventional neuro-radiologists. Reviewers rated the images by answering questions related to both the quality of the stent and artery visualization and the clinical utility of the images. Raw agreement statistics, ICC, and kappa statistics were computed for the questionnaire results.
   RESULTS: Of 57 clinical evaluations, 5 were not evaluated due to the use of large balloon-mounted stents (n = 4) and a failed contrast injection (n = 1). In 50 of 52 evaluated examinations, the reviewers agreed that simultaneous stent and vessel visualization was of diagnostic quality. There was strong agreement that stent vessel wall apposition could be assessed (kappa = 0.79). CBCT detected contrast filling defects (kappa = 0.85) and vascular calcification (kappa = 0.68). Artifacts resulting from the aneurysm coil mass impaired the delineation of adjacent structures (kappa = 0.72).
   CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a technique that enables simultaneous clinically useful imaging of neurovascular stents and their host arteries that is unobtainable with other current imaging modalities. Further improvements are required to reduce artifacts from large coil masses due to x-ray scattering.

AB Our purpose was to clarify the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of the brachial and lumbar plexuses in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) using various kinds of sequences, including diffusion-weighted images (DWI).
   We evaluated the MR imaging findings for lumbar and/or brachial nerve plexuses in 13 CIDP patients and 11 normal volunteers. The nerve swelling was evaluated in comparison with normal controls by coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and signal abnormalities were evaluated by coronal STIR, T1-weighted images, and DWIs. The degrees of contrast enhancement and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the plexus were also assessed.
   In the patient group, diffuse enlargement and abnormally high signals were detected in 16 out of 24 plexuses (66.7%) on STIR, a slightly high signal was detected in 12 of 24 plexuses (50%) on T1-weighted images, and a high-intensity signal was detected in 10 of 18 plexuses (55.6%) on DWIs with high ADC values. Contrast enhancement of the plexuses was revealed in 6 of 19 plexuses (31.6%) and was mild in all cases. There were statistically significant differences between the ADC values of patients with either swelling or abnormal signals and those of both normal volunteers and patients without neither swelling nor abnormal signals. There were no relationships between MR imaging and any clinical findings.
   STIR is sufficient to assist clinicians in diagnosing CIDP. T1-weighted images and DWIs seemed useful for speculating about the pathological changes in swollen plexuses in CIDP patients.

AB Neuropathological studies report varying patterns of brain mineralization in Parkinson's diseases (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P). Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is the ideal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to detect mineralization of the brain. The purpose of this study was to test if SWI can differentiate PD, PSP, and MSA-P.
   Eleven patients with PD, 12 with PSP, 12 with MSA-P, and 11 healthy controls underwent SWI of the brain. Hypointensity of putamen, red nucleus, substantia nigra, and dentate nucleus in all groups were measured using an objective grading scale and scored from 0 to 3.
   In PSP, hypointensity score of red nucleus was higher than that in MSA-P (p = 0.001) and PD (p = 0.001), and a score of a parts per thousand yen2 differentiated the PSP group from the PD and MSA-P groups. Putaminal hypointensity score was higher in PSP when compared to that in PD (p = 0.003), and a score of a parts per thousand yen2 differentiated PSP from PD groups. SWI hypointensity scores of red nucleus and putamen had an excellent intrarater and interrater correlation. Substantia nigra hypointensity score of the PSP group was higher than that of the MSA-P (p = 0.004) and PD (p = 0.006) groups, but the scores had only a moderate intrarater and interrater correlation.
   SWI shows different patterns of brain mineralization in clinically diagnosed groups of PD, PSP, and MSA-P and may be considered as an additional MR protocol to help differentiate these conditions.

TI Multiple Inflow Pulsed Arterial Spin-Labeling Reveals Delays in the
   Arterial Arrival Time in Minor Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English

ID CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; OCCLUSION; MRI
AB Our purpose was to use multiple inflow pulsed ASL to investigate whether hemodynamic AAT information is sensitive to hemispheric asymmetry in acute ischemia. The cohorts included 15 patients with acute minor stroke or TIA and 15 age-matched controls. Patients were scanned by using a stroke MR imaging protocol at a median time of 74 hours. DWI lesion volumes were small and functional impairment was low; however, perfusion abnormalities were evident. Prolonged AAT values were more likely to reside in the affected hemisphere (significant when compared with controls, P < .048). An advantage of this ASL technique is the ability to use AAT information in addition to CBF to characterize ischemia.

TI Solitaire Flow-Restoration Device for Treatment of Acute Ischemic
   Stroke: Safety and Recanalization Efficacy Study in a Swine Vessel
   Occlusion Model
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MECHANICAL THROMBECTOMY; MERCI TRIAL; IN-VIVO; RETRIEVER; REMOVAL; CLOT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The extended time window and theoretic reduction in hemorrhage make mechanical strategies an attractive approach in the treatment of patients with ischemic stroke. My purpose was to evaluate the recanalization efficacy and safety of the Solitaire FR Revascularization Device in a swine vessel occlusion model.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: For recanalization efficacy, radio-opaque clots were used in 6 ascending pharyngeal arteries of the swine. Safety was assessed in 8 renal arteries with 3 passes of the device. Four vessels were harvested at 30 days, and 4, at 90 days, with microscopic examination to assess vessel damage.
   RESULTS: On deployment, immediate flow was seen in 3/6 vessels; and on retrieval, TIMI-3 recanalization was seen in 6/6. Vasospasm, which resolved on follow-up angiography with no distal emboli or vessel damage, was noted. In the renal vessels, safety evaluation findings were unremarkable, with the exception of 2 vessels harvested from a kidney at 90 days. These 2 vessels appeared without damage on microscopy; however, angiography showed shrinkage of the entire kidney, which was attributed to damage and stenosis of the main renal artery at the site of the guide-catheter insertion, likely leading to a chronic low-flow state and resultant atrophy of the entire kidney.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Solitaire Device showed good recanalization efficacy with acceptable safety. The unique stent-like design allows immediate flow restoration, a distinct advantage of the device. On the basis of this

TI Clinical and Radiological Features of Rotavirus Cerebellitis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MUTISM; ENCEPHALITIS/ENCEPHALOPATHY; ENCEPHALOPATHY; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurological manifestations, such as benign convulsions and encephalitis/encephalopathy have been reported in patients with rotavirus gastroenteritis. However, cerebellitis has not attracted much attention. The purpose of this study was to identify and report the clinical and radiologic features of rotavirus cerebellitis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of patients with rotavirus gastroenteritis exhibiting cerebellar lesions on MR imaging were collected from multiple centers in Japan. Their clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: A diagnosis of acute cerebellitis concurrent with encephalitis was made for 11 of 13 patients identified. Two patients who were diagnosed as having injury due to hypovolemic shock were excluded from the study. All 11 patients with acute cerebellitis had disorders of consciousness with onset on days 2 to 4, followed by mutism in 10 patients. Other cerebellar symptoms included dysarthria following the mutism, hypotonia, ataxia, tremor, nystagmus, and dysmetria. MR imaging lesions in the vermis or cerebellar cortex were seen at some point (day 5 to 1 year) in 10 patients. A reversible splenial lesion 13 isolated and 3 with concurrent cerebellar lesions) was found in 6 patients scanned between days 4 and 6. Transient lesions in the cerebellar white matter/nuclei manifesting reduced diffusion were seen in 6 patients during days 5 through 7. The final MR imaging performed after 1 month showed cerebellar atrophy in 10 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 11 patients with rotavirus cerebellitis exhibited nearly identical clinical and MR imaging features. Involvement of the cerebellar white matter/nuclei may be associated with the mutism. An isolated splenial lesion with homogeneously reduced diffusion is not always a benign sign indicative of complete clinical and radiologic recovery in patients with rotavirus gastroenteritis.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: HD entails damage of the WM. Our aim was to explore in vivo the regional volume and microstructure of the brain WM in HD and to correlate such findings with clinical status of the patients.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen HD gene carriers in different clinical stages of the disease and 15 healthy controls were studied with T1-weighted images for VBM and DTI for TBSS. Maps of FA, MD, and lambda parallel to and lambda perpendicular to were reconstructed.
   RESULTS: Compared with controls, in addition to neostriatum and cortical GM volume loss, individuals with HD showed volume loss in the genu of the internal capsule and subcortical frontal WM bilaterally, the right splenium of the corpus callosum, and the left corona radiata. TBSS revealed symmetrically decreased FA in the corpus callosum, fornix, external/extreme capsule, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Areas of increased MD were more extensive and included arciform fibers of the cerebral hemispheres and cerebral peduncles. Increase of the lambda parallel to and a comparatively more pronounced increase of the lambda perpendicular to underlay the decreased FA of the WM in HD. Areas of WM atrophy, decreased FA, and increased MD correlated with the severity of the motor and cognitive dysfunction, whereas only the areas with increased MD correlated with disease duration.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microstructural damage accompanies volume decrease of the WM in HD and is correlated with the clinical deficits and disease duration. MR imaging-based measures could be considered as a biomarker of neurodegeneration in HD gene carriers.

   DIFFUSION; ACCURACY; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PCT postprocessing commonly uses either the MS or a variant of the DC approach for modeling of voxel-based time-attenuation curves. There is an ongoing discussion about the respective merits and limitations of both methods, frequently on the basis of theoretic reasoning or simulated data. We performed a qualitative and quantitative comparison of DC and MS by using identical source datasets and preprocessing parameters.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the PCT data of 50 patients with acute ischemic stroke, color maps of CBF, CBV, and various temporal parameters were calculated with software implementing both DC and MS algorithms. Color maps were qualitatively categorized. Quantitative region-of-interest based measurements were made in nonischemic GM and WM, suspected penumbra, and suspected infarction core. Qualitative results, quantitative results, and PCT lesion sizes from DC and MS were statistically compared.
   RESULTS: CBF and CBV color maps based on DC and MS were of comparably high quality. Quantitative CBF and CBV values calculated by DC and MS were within the same range in nonischemic regions. In suspected penumbra regions, average CBFDC was lower than CBFMS. In suspected infarction core regions, average CBVDC was similar to CBFMS. Using adapted tissue-at-risk/nonviable-tissue thresholds, we found excellent correlation of DC and MS lesion sizes.
   CONCLUSIONS: DC and MS yielded comparable qualitative and quantitative results. Lesion sizes indicated by DC and MS showed excellent agreement when using adapted thresholds. In all cases, the same therapy decision would have been made.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Advances in functional neuroimaging studies have led to the need for improved anatomical precision to face with more and more specific challenges. Nevertheless, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (fMRI) suffers from geometrical distortions, which limit the matching between functional and anatomical data necessary to interpret fMRI results. The "FieldMap" method is the most widely used technique to correct for geometrical distortions but in some cases cannot be applied or provides unsatisfactory results. The objective of this study is thus to provide a very simple alternative method for distortion correction and to demonstrate its efficiency.
   METHODS
   This correction relies on the nonlinear registration of echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions onto their corresponding undistorted non-EPI T2 Star volume, and was tested on two independent groups of subjects undertaking the same paradigm but scanned with distinct EPI sequences.
   RESULTS
   This procedure was found to considerably decrease the mismatch between functional and anatomical data in both groups, as revealed through several quantitative and qualitative measures on both EPI volumes and activation maps.
   CONCLUSION
   This study describes a simple, rapid, and easily implementable method to significantly improve neuroanatomical accuracy of fMRI results localization, which may be relevant for future neuroimaging studies.

AB INTRODUCTION
   In the recent years numerous studies have been undertaken to study cerebral perfusion in the surrounding of intracerebral hemorrhage, addressing the question of whether there is a secondary ischemic damage. Most of these studies found a reduced perfusion adjacent to the hematoma. However, the meaning of these findings remains controversial.
   METHODS
   We used perfusion computed tomography in 17 patients to study time to peak, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume as markers of the perihemorrhagic perfusion within 3 hours after symptom onset to search for an early difference between the extent of edema and reduced perfusion.
   RESULTS
   All patients showed a significant reduction of all perfusion parameters in the perihemorrhagic area, while there was no difference between the latitude of the reduced perfusion and the edema.
   CONCLUSION
   We did not find a difference between the extension of edema and that of restricted perfusion at a very early time point and therefore could not identify any tissue at risk of ischemia. Our findings suggest reduced perfusion and edema to have a common cause rather than presupposing one another.

AB OBJECTIVE
   The 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan is commonly used in detection and staging of many malignant neoplasms. However, several benign or non-neoplastic conditions avidly accumulate 18F-FDG, causing ambiguity in interpretation of results. It is unknown whether pituitary adenomas uptake 18F-FDG and appear positive in PET imaging. Here, we present 2 cases of benign pituitary adenoma with elevated metabolic activity in 18F-FDG PET scan.
   METHODS
   Medical, neurologic, and psychiatric histories; physical examination findings; laboratory work up results; and pathologic and imaging studies were documented.
   RESULTS
   The 18F-FDG-PET images revealed foci of marked FDG uptake in pituitary adenomas of 2 patients.
   CONCLUSION
   Pituitary micro- and macro-adenomas may present as hypermetabolic foci on 18F-FDG PET scan.

AB Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) has been rarely described in the setting of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). However, existing studies have even more rarely addressed the imaging pattern of PRES-related intracranial hemorrhage. The primary purpose of this study was to define the imaging characteristics of subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the setting of PRES, including the location of hemorrhage with respect to the regions of parenchymal edema. We also reviewed PRES-related clinical features.
   We conducted a retrospective review of 263 patients with PRES seen at our institution between 2001 and 2008, and identified patients with PRES-related hemorrhage. We reviewed clinical charts and imaging studies of these patients in detail. The clinical data studied included factors predisposing to PRES (such as hypertension, eclampsia, immunosuppressant toxicity, etc.), mean arterial pressure, and coagulation parameters. Imaging characteristics we analyzed included the amount of hemorrhage, its location, multiplicity, and spatial relationship with parenchymal edema.
   We identified a total of 51 patients with PRES-related hemorrhage. The blood pressure was elevated in 80% of these patients, while 47% patients showed coagulopathy. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) was present in 46 patients and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in 14. SAH spared basal cisterns in all patients, and was usually small in amount. IPH was often multifocal, and associated mass effect was rare. In most of the 51 patients, hemorrhage occurred near the parenchymal edema.
   The prevalence of ICH in PRES was 19.4% in our series. Both SAH and IPH can occur in association with PRES, typically in a location approximating that of parenchymal edema.

AB Hemodynamics is thought to play a very important role in the initiation, growth, and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. The purpose of our study was to compare hemodynamics of intracranial aneurysms of MR fluid dynamics (MRFD) using 3D cine PC MR imaging (4D-Flow) at 1.5 T and MR-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
   4D-Flow was performed for five intracranial aneurysms by a 1.5 T MR scanner. 3D TOF MR angiography was performed for geometric information. The blood flow in the aneurysms was modeled using CFD simulation based on the finite element method. We used MR angiographic data as the vascular models and MR flow information as boundary conditions in CFD. 3D velocity vector fields, 3D streamlines, shearing velocity maps, wall shear stress (WSS) distribution maps and oscillatory shear index (OSI) distribution maps were obtained by MRFD and CFD and were compared.
   There was a moderate to high degree of correlation in 3D velocity vector fields and a low to moderate degree of correlation in WSS of aneurysms between MRFD and CFD using regression analysis. The patterns of 3D streamlines were similar between MRFD and CFD. The small and rotating shearing velocities and higher OSI were observed at the top of the spiral flow in the aneurysms. The pattern and location of shearing velocity in MRFD and CFD were similar. The location of high oscillatory shear index obtained by MRFD was near to that obtained by CFD.
   MRFD and CFD of intracranial aneurysms correlated fairly well.

AB Hemodynamics is thought to play a very important role in the initiation, growth, and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. The purpose of our study was to perform in vivo hemodynamic analysis of unruptured intracranial aneurysms of magnetic resonance fluid dynamics using time-resolved three-dimensional phase-contrast MRI (4D-Flow) at 1.5 T and to analyze relationships between hemodynamics and wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI).
   This study included nine subjects with 14 unruptured aneurysms. 4D-Flow was performed by a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner with a head coil. We calculated in vivo streamlines, WSS, and OSI of intracranial aneurysms based on 4D-Flow with our software. We evaluated the number of spiral flows in the aneurysms and compared the differences in WSS or OSI between the vessel and aneurysm and between whole aneurysm and the apex of the spiral flow.
   3D streamlines, WSS, and OSI distribution maps in arbitrary direction during the cardiac phase were obtained for all intracranial aneurysms. Twelve aneurysms had one spiral flow each, and two aneurysms had two spiral flows each. The WSS was lower and the OSI was higher in the aneurysm compared to the vessel. The apex of the spiral flow had a lower WSS and higher OSI relative to the whole aneurysm.
   Each intracranial aneurysm in this study had at least one spiral flow. The WSS was lower and OSI was higher at the apex of the spiral flow than the whole aneurysmal wall.

TI Percutaneous Vertebroplasty Is Not a Risk Factor for New Osteoporotic
   Compression Fractures: Results from VERTOS II
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

DT Article
ID VERTEBRAL BODY FRACTURE; CONSERVATIVE THERAPY; FOLLOW-UP; TRIAL; WOMEN;
   MORTALITY; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PV is increasingly used as treatment for osteoporotic VCFs. However, controversy exists as to whether PV increases the risk for new VCFs during follow-up. The purpose of our research was to assess the incidence of new VCFs in patients with acute VCFs randomized to PV and conservative therapy.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: VERTOS II is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing PV with conservative therapy in 202 patients. Incidence, distribution, and timing of new VCFs during follow-up were assessed from spine radiographs. In addition, further height loss during follow-up of treated VCFs was measured.
   RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 11.4 months (median, 12.0; range, 1-24 months), 18 new VCFs occurred in 15 of 91 patients after PV and 30 new VCFs in 21 of 85 patients after conservative therapy. This difference was not significant (P = .44). There was no higher fracture risk for adjacent-versus-distant vertebrae. Mean time to new VCF was 16.2 months after PV and 17.8 months after conservative treatment (logrank, P = .45). The baseline number of VCFs was the only risk factor for occurrence (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.95) and number (P = .01) of new VCFs. After conservative therapy, further height loss of treated vertebrae occurred more frequently (35 of 85 versus 11 of 91 patients, P < .001) and was more severe (P < .001) than after PV.
   CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of new VCFs was not different after PV compared with conservative therapy after a mean of 11.4 months' follow-up. The only risk factor for new VCFs was the number of VCFs at baseline. PV contributed to preservation of stature by decreasing both the incidence and severity of further height loss in treated vertebrae.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The reported incidence of PCE during PV varies, depending on the sensitivity of diagnostic tests used. To assess the true incidence of PCE, we performed native chest CT during follow-up in a large proportion of patients from the VERTOS II trial.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: VERTOS II is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing PV with conservative therapy in 202 patients. After a mean follow-up of 22 months (median, 21 months; range, 6-42 months), 54 of 78 patients (69%) with 80 vertebrae treated with PV underwent native chest CT to detect possible PCE. The presence, location, number, and size of PCE were recorded. In addition, the presence of pulmonary parenchymal changes adjacent to PCE was noted. Possible risk factors for PCE, such as age, sex, number of treated vertebrae, cement volume per vertebra, and presence and location of perivertebral cement leakage, were evaluated.
   RESULTS: PCE was detected in 14 of 54 patients (26%; 95% CI, 16%-39%). All patients were asymptomatic. Cement emboli were small and randomly distributed in peripheral small vessels. There were no reactive pulmonary changes. Cement leakage in the azygos vein was the only risk factor for the occurrence of PCE (OR, 43; 95% CI, 5-396).
   CONCLUSIONS: Small and clinically silent PCE occurred in a quarter of patients treated with PV. Cement leakage into the azygos vein was the only risk factor. With time, these small cement emboli remained inert, without inflammatory pulmonary response. Standard postprocedural CT or chest radiographs are not necessary.

AB In the head and neck, squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common tumour types. Currently, the primary imaging modalities for initial locoregional staging are computed tomography and-to a lesser extent-magnetic resonance imaging, whilst [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography has additional value in the detection of subcentimetric metastatic lymph nodes and of tumour recurrence after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, dependency on the morphological and size-related criteria of anatomical imaging and the limited spatial resolution and FDG avidity of inflammation in metabolic imaging may reduce diagnostic accuracy in the head and neck. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that measures the differences in water mobility in different tissue microstructures. Water mobility is likely influenced by cell size, density, and cellular membrane integrity and is quantified by means of the apparent diffusion coefficient. As such, the technique is able to differentiate tumoural tissue from normal tissue, inflammatory tissue and necrosis. In this article, we examine the use of DWI in head and neck cancer, focussing on technique optimization and image interpretation. Afterwards, the value of DWI will be outlined for clinical questions regarding nodal staging, lesion characterization, differentiation of post-CRT tumour recurrence from necrosis and inflammation, and predictive imaging towards treatment outcome. The possible consequences of adding DWI towards therapeutic management are outlined.

   PROUROKINASE; EMBOLECTOMY; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular treatments are being increasingly used in acute ischemic stroke, and better tools are needed to determine which patients may benefit most from these techniques. We hypothesized that specific chronic diseases can be used, along with age and stroke severity, to predict endovascular stroke treatment outcomes.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2 single-arm trials of a thrombectomy device, MERCI and Multi MERCI, were pooled for analysis. A predictive score was developed by using the independent contribution of variables in multivariable analysis.
   RESULTS: HTN, DM, and AFib were found to predict outcomes. These 3 conditions contribute equally to a CDS that predicts outcomes independent of other predictor variables, including age, stroke severity, and vessel recanalization. A 10-level predictive score, the THRIVE score, which incorporates age, stroke severity, and the CDS, was developed. The THRIVE score strongly predicts outcome and mortality at 90 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Specific chronic diseases influence poststroke outcomes among patients undergoing endovascular stroke treatment, independent of other predictors of outcome. The THRIVE score reflects the contributions of chronic disease, age, and stroke severity and strongly predicts endovascular stroke treatment outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusion of the AOP results in a characteristic pattern of ischemia: bilateral paramedian thalamus with or without midbrain involvement. Although the classic imaging findings are often recognized, only a few small case series and isolated cases of AOP infarction have been reported. The purpose of this study was to characterize the complete imaging spectrum of AOP infarction on the basis of a large series of cases obtained from multiple institutions.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging and clinical data of 37 patients with AOP infarction from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. The primary imaging criterion for inclusion was an abnormal signal intensity on MR imaging and/or hypoattenuation on CT involving distinct arterial zones of the bilateral paramedian thalami with or without rostral midbrain involvement. Patients were excluded if there was a neoplastic, infectious, or inflammatory etiology.
   RESULTS: We identified 4 ischemic patterns of AOP infarction: 1) bilateral paramedian thalamic with midbrain (43%), 2) bilateral paramedian thalamic without midbrain (38%), 3) bilateral paramedian thalamic with anterior thalamus and midbrain (14%), and 4) bilateral paramedian thalamic with anterior thalamus without midbrain (5%). A previously unreported finding (the "V" sign) on FLAIR and DWI sequences was identified in 67% of cases of AOP infarction with midbrain involvement and supports the diagnosis when present.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 4 distinct patterns of ischemia identified in our large case series, along with the midbrain V sign, should improve recognition of AOP infarction and assist with the neurologic evaluation and management of patients with thalamic strokes.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether tract-specific diffusion tensor imaging measures in somatosensory and motor pathways correlate with clinical grades as defined using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) in cerebral palsy (CP) children.
   Quantitative diffusion tensor tractography was performed on 39 patients with spastic quadriparesis (mean age = 8 years) and 14 age/sex-matched controls. All patients were graded on the basis of GMFCS scale into grade II (n = 12), grade IV (n = 22), and grade V (n = 5) CP and quantitative analysis reconstruction of somatosensory and motor tracts performed.
   Significant inverse correlation between clinical grade and fractional anisotropy (FA) was observed in both right and left motor and sensory tracts. A significant direct correlation of mean diffusivity values from both motor and sensory tracts was also observed with clinical grades. Successive decrease in FA values was observed in all tracts except for left motor tracts moving from age/sex-matched controls to grade V through grades II and IV.
   We conclude that white matter tracts from both the somatosensory and the motor cortex play an important role in the pathophysiology of motor disability in patients with CP.

   PERFUSION; PROFILES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently introduced 320-detector row CT enables whole brain perfusion imaging compared to a limited scanning area in 64-detector row CT. Our aim was to evaluate patient radiation exposure in comprehensive stroke imaging by using multidetector row CT consisting of standard CT of the head, CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, and CTP.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Organ doses were measured by using LiF-TLDs located at several organ sites in an Alderson-Rando phantom. Effective doses were derived from these measurements. Stroke protocols including noncontrast head CT, CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, and CTP were performed on 320- and 64-detector row scanners.
   RESULTS: Measured effective doses for the different scanning protocols ranged between 1.61 and 4.56 mSv, resulting in an effective dose for complete stroke imaging of 7.52/7.54 mSv (m/f) for 64-detector row CT and 10.56/10.6 mSv (m/f) for 320-detector row CT. The highest organ doses within the area of the primary beam were measured in the skin (92 mGy) and cerebral hemispheres (69.91 mGy). Use of an eye-protection device resulted in a 54% decrease of the lens dose measured for the combo protocol for whole-brain perfusion with the 320-detector row CT scanner.
   CONCLUSIONS: Phantom measurements indicate that comprehensive stroke imaging with multidetector row CT may result in effective radiation doses from 7.52 mSv (64-detector row CT) to 10.6 mSv (320-detector row CT). The technique of 320-detector row CT offers additional information on the time course of vascular enhancement and whole-brain perfusion. Physicians should weigh the potential of the new technique against the higher radiation dose that is needed. Critical doses that would cause organ damage were not reached.

TI Onset and Progression of Pathologic Atrophy in Huntington Disease: A
   Longitudinal MR Imaging Study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAIN VOLUME CHANGES; PREDICTION; AGE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Longitudinal MR imaging measures provide an opportunity to track progression in HD before the emergence of clinical symptoms. This may prove useful in assessing disease-modifying treatments. We investigated how caudate and global volumes change as HD progresses from premanifest to early disease.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty HD gene-positive individuals and 19 controls underwent serial volumetric MR imaging (baseline, 12 and 27 months; 2 or 3 scans per person). At baseline, 3 patients with HD were premanifest but developed overt motor features during the study, and 37 had early HD. All had dates of motor onset recorded. Caudates, lateral ventricles, and TIVs were measured using semiautomated procedures. Linear mixed models were used to investigate differences between HD and controls in relation to motor onset, controlling for TIV, sex, and age.
   RESULTS: Extrapolating backwards in time, we found that differences in caudate and ventricular volumes between patients with HD and controls were evident 14 and 5 years, respectively, before motor onset (P < .05). At onset, caudate volume was 2.58 mL smaller than that in controls (P < .0001); ventricular volume was 9.27 mL larger (P < .0001). HD caudate atrophy rates were linear, showed low variability between subjects, and were approximately 10-fold higher than those in controls (P < .001). HD ventricular enlargement rates were variable between subjects, were approximately 4-fold higher than those in controls at onset (P < .001), and accelerated with disease duration (P = .02).
   CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence of acceleration of global atrophy in HD with disproportionate caudate involvement. Both caudate and global measures may be of use as early markers of HD pathology.

TI The Efficacy of Endovascular Stenting in the Treatment of Supraclinoid
   Internal Carotid Artery Blister Aneurysms Using a Stent-in-Stent
   Technique
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

DT Article
ID COIL EMBOLIZATION; NONBRANCHING SITES; RUPTURE; BYPASS; OCCLUSION;
   SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blister aneurysms of the supraclinoid ICA represent a rare but well-documented cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. These aneurysms are difficult to detect, and their surgical treatment is challenging, with high morbidity and mortality rates. The reports currently in the literature that describe the surgical and endovascular treatment of these aneurysms offer no clear consensus on the optimal treatment. We describe a staged endovascular treatment entailing stenting using a stent-in-stent technique, as well as planned but delayed embolization as the aneurysm increases in size to allow the introduction of coils.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all cerebral angiograms performed at our institution over an 8-month period for evaluation of subarachnoid hemorrhage, identifying 6 ICA blister aneurysms.
   RESULTS: All 6 blister aneurysms were located in the supraclinoid ICA. The stent-in-stent technique was used for the initial treatment of all patients. Three patients had no residual or recurrent aneurysm following initial treatment. Three patients required retreatment with coils after continued growth of the aneurysm, identified on follow-up angiography. Five patients had good recovery (average mRS score of 1), and 1 patient had poor neurologic recovery (mRS score of 3) due to a large hemorrhagic infarction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case series suggests that staged endovascular treatment entailing the use of a stent-in-stent technique, augmented with subsequent coil embolization as necessary for progressive disease, is a viable endovascular option for treating ruptured supraclinoid blister aneurysms, allowing for parent artery preservation.

AB Polymicrogyria is one of the most common malformations of cortical development. It has been known for many years and its clinical and MRI manifestations are well described. Recent advances in imaging, however, have revealed that polymicrogyria has many different appearances on MR imaging, suggesting that is may be a more heterogeneous malformation than previously suspected. The clinical and imaging heterogeneity of polymicrogyria is explored in this review.

AB Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurological disease resulting from dietary thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. WE is characterized by changes in consciousness, ocular dysfunction, and ataxia. Neuroradiologic findings usually show symmetric signal intensity alterations in the mammillary bodies, medial thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal area. Selective involvement of the cranial nerve nuclei, cerebellum, red nuclei, dentate nuclei, fornix, splenium, cerebral cortex, and basal ganglia characterize nonalcoholic WE patients. Furthermore, symmetric basal ganglia alterations with involvement of the putamen have only been observed in children. The incidence of WE is underestimated in both adult and pediatric patients. Interestingly, the frequency of WE in children appears to be similar to that observed in adults. The prognosis of the disease largely depends on the time from diagnosis to thiamine supplementation. The aim of this pediatric literature review is to provide an update on neuroradiologic findings in children affected by WE in an effort to determine pertinent clinical and imaging findings that can improve the detection and early identification of the disease. A thorough knowledge of the MRI findings of WE will assist in arriving at an early diagnosis, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease in children.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Concerns have recently grown regarding the safety of iodinated contrast agents used for CIA and CTP imaging We tested whether the incidence of AN, defined by a >= 25% increase in the post contrast scan creatinine level, was higher among patients with ischemic stroke who underwent a functional contrast-enhanced CT protocol compared with those who had no iodinated contrast administration
   MATERIALS AND METHODS The contrast-exposed group consisted of 575 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent CIA In = 313), CTA/CTP (n = 224), or CTA/CTP followed by conventional angiography In = 38) within 24 hours of stroke onset and were consecutively enrolled in a prospective cohort study The nonexposed group consisted of 343 patients with ischemic stroke, consecutively admitted to the same institution, who did not receive iodinated contrast material Patients were stratified by baseline eGFR In the primary analysis, the Fisher exact test was used to compare the incidence of AN between the contrast-exposed and the nonexposed patients at 24, 48, and 72 hours and on a cumulative basis A secondary analysis compared the incidence of AN in patients who underwent conventional angiography following CTA/CTP versus patients who underwent CTA/CTP only
   RESULTS: The incidence of AN was 5% in the exposed and 10% in the nonexposed group (P = 0031 Patients who underwent conventional angiography after contrast CT were at no greater risk of AN than patients who underwent CTA/CTP alone (26 patients, 5%, and 2 patients, 5%, respectively, P = 71
   CONCLUSIONS Administration of a contrast-enhanced CT protocol involving CTA/CTP and conventional angiography in selected patients does not appear to increase the incidence of CIN

TI Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Treatment Using a Combination of Onyx
   and a New Detachable Tip Microcatheter, SONIC: Short-Term Results
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

   MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE. Endovascular embolization with Onyx is one of the tools used in the treatment of intracerebral AVMs The recent introduction of a new microcatheter with detachable tip has led us to adopt a new treatment approach by using endovascular embolization with Onyx as the main treatment for brain AVM with curative intent The purpose of the present study is to evaluate our initial results by using this new treatment strategy with special emphasis on the safety and feasibility of the technique
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three consecutive patients were treated by embolization for brain AVM over a 14-month period, mostly by using Onyx and a microcatheter with detachable tip Twenty-six of these patients (60%) harbored Spetzler-Martin AVMs of grades 4-5
   RESULTS Endovascular treatments were completed in 29 out of 43 patients, the median number of procedures per patient was 2 (range, 1-4) Complete obliteration by using embolization exclusively was achieved in 16 patients, resulting in a 55% cure rate in patients who concluded treatments (16/29) and 37% in the cohort (16/43) The amount of Onyx injected by using rnicrocatheters with detachable tips was significantly larger than that injected with the nondetachable microcatheters (mean volume, 2 5 +/- 2 2 versus 1 7 +/- 1 3 mL, respectively, P < 05, t test) Seven clinical complications were observed in a total of 76 embolization sessions (9 2%)
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular embolization of brain AVM by using Onyx and SONIC results in a relatively high complete obliteration The use of the microcatheter with detachable tip adds several advantages, mainly in that higher volumes of Onyx can be safely injected

AB The purpose of the study is to evaluate patients with wide-necked or complex aneurysms of the anterior circulation who underwent Solitaire (TM) AB Neurovascular Remodeling Device-assisted coil embolization.
   From February 2008 to March 2009, consecutive data were collected from 45 patients with anterior circulation aneurysms. Eighteen of the patients presented with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Forty-six aneurysms were treated with the aid of different applications (n = 49) of the Solitaire (TM) AB Remodeling Device followed by standard coiling procedure (n = 43) using bioactive coils or/and bare coils.
   Successful positioning of the remodeling device was obtained in 95.9% of the cases. There were two thromboembolic complications (4.1%) and one severe vasospasm requiring retrieval of the device. Permanent procedural morbidity was observed in one patient (2%). The proportion of patients in whom Raymond class 1 occlusion was obtained was 53.5% (n = 23). Raymond class 2 occlusion was achieved in 42% (n = 18) and Raymond class 3 occlusion in 4.7% (n = 2). Thirty-nine patients left the hospital with a good clinical status.
   The initial technical and clinical results of Solitaire (TM) AB device-assisted coiling of aneurysms in the anterior circulation are highly encouraging. This technique may enhance the possibilities of the endovascular treatment of these aneurysms in clinical routine.

AB Dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVFs) are a potentially dangerous group of intracranial arteriovenous shunts with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment has traditionally included transvenous and/or transarterial embolisation, which may be followed by surgical ligation. This study assesses the impact of Onyx on treatment.
   Forty-nine consecutive patients referred for endovascular management of DAVFs between 1994 and 2008 were included in a retrospective, intention-to-treat analysis. DAVFs managed conservatively or purely surgically were excluded. Success rates and complications were compared between patients treated by transvenous, transarterial Onyx and transarterial non-Onyx material embolisation.
   Fifty-six separate DAVFs were detected in 49 patients. Embolisation of 52 DAVFs was performed or attempted. Transvenous sinus occlusion of ten type I or II DAVFs resulted in cure but was unsuccessful in a single type IV fistula and three of the four indirect carotico-cavernous fistulae treated in this way. Two type I and nine type III/IV were identified in the transarterial, non-Onyx group and three of 11 (27.3%) were cured. Amongst the six type II and 20 type III/IV DAVFs belonging to the transarterial Onyx group, cure was achieved in 17 of 26 (65.4%) rising to 72.7%, considering only those cases where the fistula could be accessed and Onyx was injected.
   The introduction of Onyx has improved the endovascular cure rate of DAVFs, particularly types III and IV. Advances in technology have made an endovascular approach the management of choice for the majority of DAVFs requiring treatment. Low complication rates are achievable.

AB Cranial ultrasound (cUS) may not be reliable for detection of diffuse white matter (WM) injury. Our aim was to assess in very preterm infants the reliability of a classification system for WM injury on sequential cUS throughout the neonatal period, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as reference standard.
   In 110 very preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks), serial cUS during admission (median 8, range 4-22) and again around term equivalent age (TEA) and a single MRI around TEA were performed. cUS during admission were assessed for presence of WM changes, and contemporaneous cUS and MRI around TEA additionally for abnormality of lateral ventricles. Sequential cUS (from birth up to TEA) and MRI were classified as normal/mildly abnormal, moderately abnormal, or severely abnormal, based on a combination of findings of the WM and lateral ventricles. Predictive values of the cUS classification were calculated.
   Sequential cUS were classified as normal/mildly abnormal, moderately abnormal, and severely abnormal in, respectively, 22%, 65%, and 13% of infants and MRI in, respectively, 30%, 52%, and 18%. The positive predictive value of the cUS classification for the MRI classification was high for severely abnormal WM (0.79) but lower for normal/mildly abnormal (0.67) and moderately abnormal (0.64) WM.
   Sequential cUS during the neonatal period detects severely abnormal WM in very preterm infants but is less reliable for mildly and moderately abnormal WM. MRI around TEA seems needed to reliably detect WM injury in very preterm infants.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Metallic implants induce massive artifacts in CT images which deteriorate image quality and often superimpose structures of interest. The purpose of this study was to apply and evaluate a dedicated MAR method for neuroradiologic intracranial clips and detachable platinum coiling events. We here report the first clinical results for MAR in FDCT.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: FDCT volume scans of several patients treated with endovascular coiling or intracranial clipping were corrected by using a dedicated FDCT MAR correction algorithm combined with an edge-preserving attenuation-normalization method in the projection space. Corrected and uncorrected images were compared by 2 experienced radiologists and evaluated for several image-quality features.
   RESULTS: After application of our algorithm, implant delineation and visibility were highly improved. CT values compared with values in metal artifact unaffected areas showed good agreement (average correction of 1300 HU). Image noise was reduced overall by 27%. Intracranial hemorrhage in the direct surroundings of the implanted coil or clip material was displayed without worrisome metal artifacts, and our algorithm even allowed diagnosis in areas where extensive information losses were seen. The high spatial resolution provided by FDCT imaging was well preserved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our MAR method provided metal artifact reduced images in every studied case. It reduced image noise and corrected CT values to levels comparable with images measured without metallic implants. An overall improvement of brain tissue modeling and implant visibility was achieved. MAR in neuroradiologic FDCT imaging is a promising step forward for better image quality and diagnosis in the presence of metallic implants.

TI Transvenous Embolization of Dural Carotid Cavernous Fistulas: A Series
   of 44 Consecutive Patients
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULAS; FACIAL VEIN; SINUS; COMPLICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular TVE for DCCF is used for curative purposes, but serious complications can be caused with inadequate embolization. Our aim was to report clinical characteristics, angiographic findings, and results of endovascular TVE in patients presenting with DCCF.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 44 consecutive patients with DCCF treated by TVE. Approach routes, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and complications were assessed.
   RESULTS: An approach via the internal jugular vein and inferior petrosal sinus was possible in 90% of patients, with complete occlusion of the fistula in 81.6% of patients. A minor residual shunt remained in 13.6% of patients, while a significant shunt remained in 4.5%. In 4 patients, add-on management with transarterial embolization was useful, and in 2 patients with residual shunt, radiosurgery was used. With long-term follow-up (6-40 months), we encountered recanalization/recurrence in 4 patients (9.1%). Complications were seen in the form of permanent morbidity in 3 patients (7%) and transient morbidity in 6 patients (14%).
   CONCLUSIONS: For endovascular treatment of DCCF, a transvenous approach was effective in most of our patients; however, some adverse effects were encountered. If AV shunts remain after transvenous treatment, additional modalities must be considered.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: VBM is increasingly used in the study of neurodegeneration, and recently there has been interest in its potential as a biomarker. However, although it is largely "automated," VBM is rarely implemented consistently across studies, and changing user-specified options can alter the results in a way similar to the very biologic differences under investigation.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work uses data from patients with HD to demonstrate the effects of several user-specified VBM parameters and analyses: type and level of statistical correction, modulation, smoothing kernel size, adjustment for brain size, subgroup analysis, and software version.
   RESULTS: The results demonstrate that changing these options can alter results in a way similar to the biologic differences under investigation.
   CONCLUSIONS: If VBM is to be useful clinically or considered for use as a biomarker, there is a need for greater recognition of these issues and more uniformity in its application for the method to be both reproducible and valid.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Water in biological structures often displays non-Gaussian diffusion behavior. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of non-Gaussian fitting by using the kurtosis model of the signal intensity decay curves obtained from DWI by using an extended range of b-values in studies of phantoms and HNSCC.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with HNSCC underwent DWI by using 6 b-factors (0, 50-1500 s/mm(2)) at 1.5T. Monoexponential (yielding ADC(mono)) and non-Gaussian kurtosis (yielding apparent diffusion coefficient D-app and apparent kurtosis coefficient K-app) fits were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis in selected regions of interest (primary tumors, metastatic lymph nodes, and spinal cord). DWI studies were also performed on phantoms containing either water or homogenized asparagus. To determine whether the kurtosis model provided a significantly better fit than did the monoexponential model, an F test was performed. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess correlations between K-app and D-app.
   RESULTS: The kurtosis model fit the experimental data points significantly better than did the monoexponential model (P < .05). D-app was approximately twice the value of ADC(mono) (eg, in neck nodal metastases D-app was 1.54 and ADC(mono) was 0.84). K-app showed a weak Spearman correlation with D-app in a homogenized asparagus phantom and for 44% of tumor lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of kurtosis modeling to fit DWI data acquired by using an extended b-value range in HNSCC is feasible and yields a significantly better fit of the data than does monoexponential modeling. It also provides an additional parameter, Kapp, potentially with added value.

AB Novel 320-section CT scanning equipment enables dynamic noninvasive angiographic imaging of the entire cranial vasculature (4D-CTA). We describe this technique and demonstrate its potential in arteriovenous shunting lesions. 4D-CTA imaging resulted in a correct diagnosis, lesion classification, and treatment-strategy selection in 3 patients, compared with CA. We think that 4D-CTA can further reduce the need for CA, sparing the patient the discomfort and risk associated with an invasive procedure.

   ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; CONSECUTIVE SERIES; IMAGE INTENSIFIER
AB Flat detector computed tomography (FDCT) is an imaging tool that generates three-dimensional (3-D) volumes from data obtained during C-arm rotation using CT-like reconstruction algorithms. The technique is relatively new and, at current levels of performance, lags behind conventional CT in terms of image quality. However, the advantage of its availability in the interventional room has prompted neuro-radiologists to identify clinical settings where its role is uniquely beneficial.
   We performed a search of the online literature databases to identify studies reporting experience with FDCT in interventional neuro-radiology. The studies were systematically reviewed and their findings grouped according to specific clinical situation addressed.
   FDCT images allow detection of procedural complications, evaluation of low-radiopacity stents and assessment of endosaccular coil packing in intra-cranial aneurysms. Additional roles are 3-D angiography that provides an accurate depiction of vessel morphology with low concentrations of radiographic contrast media and a potential for perfusion imaging due to its dynamic scanning capability. A single scan combining soft tissue and angiographic examinations reduces radiation dose and examination time. Ongoing developments in flat detector technology and reconstruction algorithms are expected to further enhance its performance and increase this range of applications.
   FDCT images provide useful information in neuro-interventional setting. If current research confirms its potential for assessing cerebral haemodynamics by perfusion scanning, the combination would redefine it as an invaluable tool for interventional neuro-radiology procedures. This facility and its existing capabilities of parenchymal and angiographic imaging would also extend its use to the triage of acute stroke patients.

   REPRODUCIBILITY; ENDARTERECTOMY; HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Surface disruption, either ulceration or fibrous cap rupture, has been identified as a key feature of the unstable atherosclerotic plaque. In this prospective observational study, we sought to determine the characteristics of the carotid lesion that predict the development of new surface disruption.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight asymptomatic individuals with 50%-79% carotid stenosis underwent carotid MR imaging at baseline and at 3 years. Multicontrast imaging criteria were used to determine the presence or absence of calcification, LRNC, intraplaque hemorrhage, and surface disruption. Volume measurements of plaque morphology and the LRNC and calcification, when present, were collected.
   RESULTS: At baseline, 21.3% (23/108) of participants were identified with a surface disruption. After 3 years, 9 (10.6%) of the remaining 85 individuals without disruption at baseline developed a new surface disruption during follow-up. Among all baseline variables associated with new surface disruption during regression analysis, the proportion of wall volume occupied by the LRNC (percentage LRNC volume; OR per 5% increase, 2.6; 95% Cl, 1.5-4.6) was the strongest classifier (AUC = 0.95) during ROC analysis. New surface disruption was associated with a significant increase in percentage LRNC volume (1.7 +/- 2.0% per year, P = .035).
   CONCLUSIONS: This prospective investigation of asymptomatic individuals with 50%-79% stenosis provides compelling evidence that LRNC size may govern the risk of future surface disruption, Identification of carotid plaques in danger of developing new surface disruption may prove clinically valuable for preventing the transition from stable to unstable atherosclerotic disease.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging features of HE have not been fully established. The purpose of this study was to determine the topographic distribution and DWI findings of HE.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated HE MR imaging (n = 11). The topographic distribution of the lesions was evaluated on routine MR imaging, and DWI SI and ADC values were assessed. The ADC value of involved lesions was compared with the noninvolved subcortical WM area by use of the paired t test.
   RESULTS: MR images demonstrated bilateral diffusion-restrictive lesions in the posterior limb of the IC (n = 6), cerebral cortex (n = 8), CR (n = 7), CS (n = 9), hippocampus (n = 4), and BG (n = 1). The mean ADC value of lesions was 448.82 +/- 92.34 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s compared with the mean ADC value of noninvolved lesions (837.72 +/- 62.14 X 10-6 mm(2)/s); this difference was statistically significant (P < .000). The lesions showed complete resolution on follow-up DWI for 6 patients. Three patients with cortical involvement of >= 2 lobes showed partial recovery or death, but most of the other patients with WM involvement or cortical involvement in only 1 lobe experienced complete recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The topographic localization of the lesions was the posterior limb of the IC, cerebral cortex, CR, CS, hippocampus, and BG. Most HE lesions probably correspond to areas of reversible cytotoxic edema as seen on DWI, which car predict the prognosis of HE according to the degree of lesion extent.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Concomitant chemoradiation is a promising therapy for the treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate early changes in primary tumor perfusion parameters during concomitant cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy of locoregionally advanced SCCHN and to evaluate their predictive value for response of the primary tumor to therapy.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with locoregionally advanced SCCHN underwent perfusion CT scans before therapy and after completion of 40 Gy and 70 Gy of chemoradiotherapy. BF, BV, MTT, and PS of primary tumors were quantified. Differences in perfusion and tumor volume values during the therapy as well as between responders and nonresponders were analyzed, and ROC curves were used to assess predictive value of the baseline and follow-up functional parameters.
   RESULTS: The tumor volumes at 40 Gy and at 70 Gy were significantly lower compared with baseline values (P = .014 and P = 007). In the 6 nonresponders, measurements after 40 Gy showed a nonsignificant trend of increased BF, BV, and PS values compared with the baseline values (P = .06). In 14 responders, a significant reduction of BF values was recorded after 40 Gy (P = .04) and after 70 Gy (P = .01). In responders, BV values showed a reduction after 40 Gy followed by a plateau after 70 Gy (P = .04), whereas in nonresponders there was a nonsignificant elevation of the BV. Baseline BV predicted short-term tumor response with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 100% (P = .01). After completion of 40 Gy of concomitant chemoradiation BV was a more significant predictor than were BF and MTT.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in advanced SCCHN the perfusion CT monitoring might be of predictive value for identifying tumors that may respond to cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy.

AB The endovascular treatment of wide-necked aneurysms remains challenging. The "Y"-stenting technique has been used for stent-assisted coil embolization of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. So far, this technique has been described for aneurysms of the basilar apex or the middle cerebral artery bifurcation and only for open stent systems using the Neuroform stent. We report a 52-year-old woman with recurrence of a wide-necked aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery that was successfully retreated by stent-assisted coiling using the "Y"-stenting technique with the Enterprise stent system.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and potential clinical applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography in the normal and pathologic brachial plexus prospectively.
   Six asymptomatic volunteers and 12 patients with symptoms related to the brachial plexus underwent DTI on a 1.5T system in addition to the routine anatomic plexus imaging protocol. Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and of fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as tractography of the brachial plexus were obtained. Images were evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists in a prospective fashion. Three patients underwent surgery, and nine patients underwent conservative medical treatment.
   Reconstructed DTI (17/18) were of good quality (one case could not be reconstructed due to artifacts). In all volunteers and in 11 patients, the roots and the trunks were clearly delineated with tractography. Mean FA and mean ADC values were as follows: 0.30 +/- 0.079 and 1.70 +/- 0.35 mm(2)/s in normal fibers, 0.22 +/- 0.04 and 1.49 +/- 0.49 mm(2)/s in benign neurogenic tumors, and 0.24 +/- 0.08 and 1.51 +/- 0.52 mm(2)/s in malignant tumors, respectively. Although there was no statistically significant difference in FA and ADC values of normal fibers and fibers at the level of pathology, tractography revealed major differences regarding fiber architecture. In benign neurogenic tumors (n = 4), tractography revealed fiber displacement alone (n = 2) or fiber displacement and encasement by the tumor (n = 2), whereas in the malignant tumors, either fiber disruption/destruction with complete disorganization (n = 6) or fiber displacement (n = 1) were seen. In patients with fiber displacement alone, surgery confirmed the tractography findings, and excision was successful without sequelae.
   Our preliminary data suggest that DTI with tractography is feasible in a clinical routine setting. DTI may demonstrate normal tracts, tract displacement, deformation, infiltration, disruption, and disorganization of fibers due to tumors located within or along the brachial plexus, therefore, yielding additional information to the current standard anatomic imaging protocols.

DT Article
ID CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME; HUMAN BRAIN-TUMORS; GRADIENT-ECHO; GRADE;
   HISTOPATHOLOGY; PERMEABILITY; RECURRENCE; TISSUE; MAPS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) accuracy can vary substantially depending on the dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) acquisition and postprocessing methods, due to blood-brain barrier disruption and resulting T1-weighted leakage and T2-and/or T2*-weighted imaging (T2/T2*WI) residual effects. We set out to determine optimal DSC conditions that address these errors and maximize rCBV accuracy in differentiating posttreatment radiation effect (PTRE) and tumor.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with previously treated high-grade gliomas undergoing image-guided re-resection of recurrent contrast-enhancing MR imaging lesions. Thirty-six surgical tissue samples were collected from 11 subjects. Preoperative 3T DSC used 6 sequential evenly timed acquisitions, each by using a 0.05-mmol/kg gadodiamide bolus. Preload dosing (PLD) and baseline subtraction (BLS) techniques corrected T1-weighted leakage and T2/T2*WI residual effects, respectively. PLD amount and incubation time increased with each sequential acquisition. Corresponding tissue specimen stereotactic locations were coregistered to DSC to measure localized rCBV under varying PLD amounts, incubation times, and the presence of BLS. rCBV thresholds were determined to maximize test accuracy (average of sensitivity and specificity) in distinguishing tumor (n = 21) and PTRE (n = 15) samples under the varying conditions. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) areas under the curve (AUCs) were statistically compared.
   RESULTS: The protocol that combined PLD (0.1-mmol/kg amount, 6-minute incubation time) and BLS correction methods maximized test AUC (0.99) and accuracy (95.2%) compared with uncorrected rCBV AUC (0.85) and accuracy (81.0%) measured without PLD and BLS (P = .01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Combining PLD and BLS correction methods for T1-weighted and T2/T2*WI errors, respectively, enables highly accurate differentiation of PTRE and tumor growth.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Four-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography (4D-CE-MRA) at 3T may replace digital subtraction angrography (DSA) for certain diagnostic purposes in patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 4D-CE-MRA at 3T enables the same characterization of intracranial DAVFs as DSA.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 18 consecutive patients with intracranial DAVFs (11 women, 7 men; age range, 35-82 years; mean age, 64.8 years). They underwent 4D-CF-MRA at 3T and DSA. The 4D-CE-MRA series combined randomly segmented central k-space ordering, keyhole imaging, sensitivity encoding, and half-Fourier imaging. We obtained 30 dynamic scans every 1.9 seconds with a spatial resolution of 1 X 1 X 1.5 mm. Two independent readers reviewed the 4D-CE-MRA images for main arterial feeders, fistula site, and venous drainage. Interobserver and intermodality agreement was assessed by kappa statistics.
   RESULTS: At DSA, 8 fistulas were located at the transverse sigmord sinus; 8, at the cavernous sinus; and 2, at the sinus adjacent to the foramen magnum. Interobserver agreement was fair for the main arterial feeders (kappa = 0.59), excellent for the fistula site (kappa = 0.91), and good for venous drainage (kappa = 0,86). Intermodality agreement was moderate for the main arterial feeders (kappa = 0.68) and excellent for the fistula site (kappa = 1.0) and venous drainage (kappa = 1.0).
   CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between 4D-CE-MRA and DSA findings was good to excellent with respect to the fistula site and venous drainage.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fetal ventriculomegaly (VM) is important because of its high prevalence and high risk of association with other brain abnormalities. The purpose of this article was to investigate the hypotheses that including in utero MR imaging (iuMR) in the diagnostic pathway for fetuses with isolated VM on antenatal imaging will show other brain abnormalities in a high proportion of cases and that these will have a significant effect on clinical management.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-seven pregnant women were recruited prospectively from 8 fetomaternal centers in Britain. All of the fetuses had VM diagnosed on sonography but no other abnormality. iuMR was performed, and the results of the examinations were compared with those of sonography. Two fetomaternal experts made independent assessments of the effects of any new diagnoses on clinical management,
   RESULTS: Categoric assessments of ventricular size were the same in approximately 90% of fetuses. Other abnormalities were shown in 17% of fetuses. The most frequent additional brain abnormality shown on iuMR was agenesis of the corpus callosum. Severe VM was associated with an approximately 10-fold increase in the risk of another brain abnormality being present when compared with fetuses with mild VM. The most profound effects on clinical management, however, were found in cases of mild VM.
   CONCLUSIONS: This work supports our hypotheses by showing a high detection rate of other brain pathology when iuMR was used to supplement antenatal sonography (17%). In a high proportion of cases, the detection of the extra pathology would have led to significant changes in clinical management.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Region-of-interest (ROI) and tract-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses have detected increased apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in callosal and projection systems of adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We explored whether similar changes occur in pediatric patients with MS, assessing 3 major white matter pathways (interhemispheric, projection, and intrahemispheric) in both visibly involved and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI datasets from 10 patients with established pediatric MS and 10 age-sex-, and imaging technique-matched controls were analyzed. Tracts were reconstructed by using a fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm with a diffusion-weighted imaging mask and a 35 degrees angular threshold. Tracts were selected by using standard ROI placements on color FA maps cross-referenced to b = 0 T2-weighted images for studying white matter pathways. Ten identical ROIs were placed in NAWM on b = 0 T2-weighted images to ensure that both ROIs and resulting tracts passed through NAWM.
   RESULTS: In pediatric MS, all tracts had higher mean ADC values (P = .002 to P < .04) and lower mean FA(P = .009 to P < .02) than those in healthy controls. Even when the tracts were confined to NAWM, the mean ADC was higher (P < .004 to P < .05) and the mean FA was lower (P = .002 to P < .02). T2 lesion burden correlated with tract-based mean ADC. ROI mean ADC increased, and both tract and 1901 mean FA decreased with increasing T2 lesion burden, however with a statistically nonsignificant correlation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increased mean ADC and decreased mean FA occur in all 3 major white matter pathways, both in visibly involved white matter and NAWM in pediatric MS.

   ACTIVATION; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; CHILDHOOD AUTISM; CHILDREN; BRAIN;
   LATERALIZATION; FMRI; COMMUNICATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often exhibit atypical language patterns, including delay of speech onset, literal speech interpretation, and poor recognition of social and emotional cues in speech. We acquired functional MR images during an auditory language task to evaluate systematic differences in language-network activation between control and high-functioning autistic populations.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one right-handed male subjects (26 high-functioning autistic subjects, 15 controls) were studied by using an auditory phrase-recognition task, and areas of differential activation between groups were identified. Hand preference, verbal intelligence quotient (10), age, and language-function testing were included as covariables in the analysis.
   RESULTS: Control and autistic subjects showed similar language-activation networks, with 2 notable differences. Control subjects showed significantly increased activation in the left posterior insula compared with autistic subjects (P < .05, false discovery rate), and autistic subjects showed increased bilaterality of receptive language compared with control subjects. Higher receptive-language scores on standardized testing were associated with greater activation of the posterior aspect of the left Wernicke area. A higher verbal 10 was associated with greater activation of the bilateral Broca area and involvement of the prefrontal cortex and lateral premotor cortex.
   CONCLUSIONS: Control subjects showed greater activation of the posterior insula during receptive language, which may correlate with impaired emotive processing of language in autism. Subjects with autism showed greater bilateral activation of receptive-language areas, which was out of proportion to the differerces in hand preference in autism and control populations.

SO JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING
LA English
DT Article
DE Posterior reversible encephalopathy; brain; MRI;
   diffusion-weighted-imaging
ID DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MRI; LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME; UTILITY; PRES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   We report the clinical and radiological features of posterior reversible encephalopathy and compare our findings to the literature.
   METHODS
   The brain magnetic resonance imaging and clinical records of 33 patients were retrospectively evaluated. Twenty-four patients had follow-up imaging, which confirmed the reversibility of the lesions; 9 patients were clinically followed and recovered. The clinical records were analyzed for the age, sex, gender, underlying etiology, and clinical symptoms. MR images were evaluated for the distribution of the lesions, contrast enhancement and diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI) features, reversibility, and complications.
   RESULTS
   The most commonly involved localizations were frontal lobe in 51.5%, parietal lobe in 84.8%, occipital lobe in 72.7%, temporal lobe in 33.3%, and cerebellum in 33.3%. Nineteen patients had DWI, which showed vasogenic edema in 17 and cytotoxic edema in 2. Sixteen patients had contrast-enhanced images; 4 of them showed focal enhancement. Nine patients had the complication of hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSION
   The involvement of different localizations formerly known as atypical is now commonly encountered. Intravenous contrast administration may be of use to demonstrate focal enhancement and exclude other diseases in the differential. DWI is essential to distinguish the type of edema. Repeat imaging including DWI should be performed to follow the response to therapy.

DT Article

ID CLOPIDOGREL RESISTANCE; ASPIRIN
AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE
   Symptomatic thromboembolic events are the most common complications associated with aneurysm coiling, and carotid and intracranial stenting. Our objective is to assess the effect of aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel dose and duration on platelet inhibition using a point of care assay in neurointerventional (NI) suite.
   METHOD
   The dose, duration, and point of care platelet function assay data for clopidogrel and aspirin therapy were prospectively collected between February 2006 and November 2007. Inadequate platelet inhibition for ASA was defined as >= 550 ASA reaction units (ARU), and for clopidogrel was defined as <= 50% inhibition of the P2Y12/ADP receptor
   RESULTS
   We collected data from 216 consecutive patients. Inadequate platelet inhibition was noted in 13% of patients on aspirin and 66% of patients on clopidogrel (P-value < .0001). Patients taking clopidogrel 75 mg for >= 7 days, 300 mg for 24 hours, and 600 mg same day load had a mean P2Y12/ADP inhibition of 45%, 35% (P-value = .09), and 16%, respectively (P-value = .005).
   CONCLUSION
   Premedication with clopidogrel, in contrast to aspirin, does not achieve adequate platelet inhibition in about two-third of the patients. Same day antiplatelet loading may be insufficient to achieve adequate platelet inhibition and should be avoided if clinically feasible.

TI The Effect of Exercise on the Cerebral Vasculature of Healthy Aged

LA English
DT Article
ID WHITE-MATTER; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; AEROBIC FITNESS; VALIDITY; BRAIN;
   RELIABILITY; TORTUOSITY; LEUKOARAIOSIS; PATHOLOGY; LESIONS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prior studies suggest that aerobic exercise may reduce both the brain atrophy and the decline in fractional anisotropy observed with advancing age. It is reasonable to hypothesize that exercise-induced changes to the vasculature may underlie these anatomic differences. The purpose of this blinded study was to compare high-activity and low-activity healthy elderly volunteers for differences in the cerebrovasculature as calculated from vessels extracted from noninvasive MR angiograms (MRAs).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen healthy elderly subjects underwent MRA. Seven subjects reported a high level of aerobic activity (64 +/- 5 years of age; 5 men, 2 women) and 7, a low activity level (68 +/- 6 years of age; 5 women, 2 men). Following vessel segmentation from MRA by an individual blinded to subject activity level, quantitative measures of vessel number, radius, and tortuosity were calculated and histogram analysis of vessel number and radius was performed.
   RESULTS: Aerobically active subjects exhibited statistically significant reductions in vessel tortuosity and an increased number of small vessels compared with less active subjects.
   CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic activity in elderly subjects is associated with lower vessel tortuosity values and an increase in the number of small-caliber vessels. It is possible that an aerobic exercise program may contribute to healthy brain aging. MRA offers a noninvasive approach to visualizing the cerebral vasculature and may prove useful in future longitudinal investigations.

   COILS; MR-ANGIOGRAPHY; SACCULAR ANEURYSMS; BERRY ANEURYSMS; TRIAL ISAT;
   EXPERIENCE; ELECTROTHROMBOSIS; EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The endovascular treatment (EVT) of cerebral aneurysms has experienced a revolution since 1991 with the introduction of platinum coil technology. During the past 10 years, there has been significant study of the feasibility of this technique, and clinical results of EVT have been published. The long-term durability of Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization of cerebral aneurysms still remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability of anatomic occlusion of aneurysms and to assess the rate of recanalization and retreatment of these aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and December 2003, 1036 aneurysms (804 ruptured and 232 nonruptured) were treated consecutively with GDC coils in 5 neuroradiology centers, Procedural feasibility, acute angiographic occlusion results, morbidity, and mortality associated with this technique were assessed. All patients were regularly followed by digital subtraction angiography and MR imaging each year after treatment.
   RESULTS: Initial acute angiographic results in 1036 aneurysms demonstrated total occlusion in 731 patients (70.5%), subtotal occlusion in 252 (24.3%), incomplete occlusion in 20 (1.9%), and failures in 33% (3.3%) aneurysms. A remodeling technique was used in 10%. A second procedure was performed for 72 aneurysms (7%). The total aneurysm follow-up time was 49,923 months (4160.25 aneurysm-years). The retreatment period was either in the months following initial treatment in aneurysms incompletely occluded or in years due to recanalization or de novo aneurysms. Fewer than 5 patients rebled during 10 years of follow-up. Long-term follow-up angiograms were obtained in 899 aneurysms, with 646 total, 230 subtotal, and 23 incomplete results.
   CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of cerebral aneurysms is necessary to depict recanalization. Only 7% of the aneurysms were retreated. Use of bare coils gives a good long-term level of occlusion.

ID MULTIFOCAL INFLAMMATORY LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY; RECURRENT APHTHOUS ULCERS;
   THERAPY; 5-FLUOROURACIL
AB OBJECTIVE
   To study the clinical and radiological characteristics of levamisole-induced leukoencephalopathy (LILE) in patients with recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) or infected with Ascaris.
   METHODS
   The medical histories of 16 patients with LILE were analyzed, including clinical manifestations, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain biopsy findings.
   RESULTS
   The main clinical manifestations of LILE were motor weakness (75.0%), dysphasia or aphasia (50.0%), cognitive disorder (50.0%), and facial palsy (43.8%). The MRI of 16 cases showed plaque and round or oval demyelinating lesions in white matter, which revealed a signal hypointensity on T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and demonstrated hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The MRI revealed peripheral ring-type enhancement about the focus after Gd-DTPA administration and edema around some lesions, without mass effect. T2-weighted and FLAIR images were highly sensitive to the lesions. Brain biopsy in 1 patient showed multifocal demyelinating lesions without perivascular cuffing by lymphocytes. Treatment generally consisted of steroids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and patients recovered to normal condition.
   CONCLUSIONS
   A single normal dose of levamisole can induce leukoencephalopathy in patients with RAU or Ascaris. The diagnosis depends on the clinical features and imaging appearances. Steroid therapy might be a good choice of treatment.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), postmortem studies show different topographic involvement of the thalamus, basal ganglia, and their cortical connections. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MR imaging technique sensitive to gray and white matter microstructure integrity. This study was performed to determine whether DTI may demonstrate microstructural differences between PSP and CBD, particularly within the thalamus and its cortical connections.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients with probable PSP, 11 with probable CBD, and 7 controls formed the study group. Apparent diffusion coefficient average (ADC(ave)) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured in regions of interest positioned in the ventrolateral (motor), medial, anterior, and posterior regions of the thalami, basal ganglia, fronto-orbital white matter, cingulum, supplementary motor area (SMA), and precentral and postcentral gyri in patients and controls.
   RESULTS: In PSP, ADC v. values were increased in several areas: the thalamus, particularly in its anterior and medial nuclei; cingulum; motor area; and SMA. FA values were particularly decreased in the fronto-orbital white matter, anterior cingulum, and motor area. In CBD, ADC,,. was increased in the motor thalamus, in the precentral and postcentral gyri, ipsilateral to the affected frontoparietal cortex, and in the bilateral SMA. FA was mainly decreased in the precentral gyrus and SMA, followed by the postcentral gyrus and cingulum.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PSP, thalamic involvement was diffuse and prevalent in its anterior part, whereas in CBD involvement was asymmetric and confined to the motor thalamus. DTI may be useful in the differential diagnosis of these 2 parkinsonian disorders.

TI Cranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistula: Diagnosis and Classification with
   Time-Resolved MR Angiography at 3T
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DIGITAL-SUBTRACTION-ANGIOGRAPHY; VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS; CLINICAL
   PRESENTATION; VENOUS DRAINAGE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) remains one of the few uncontested indications for catheter based cerebral angiography. We report our experience of using a commercially available form of time-resolved MR angiography (trMRA) at 3T for the diagnosis and classification of a cranial DAVF compared with the reference standard of digital subtraction angiography (DSA).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of our patient records identified patients who had undergone trMRA at 3T and DSA for the evaluation of DAVF. The trMRA consisted of whole-head, contrast-enhanced "time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics" (TRICKS) MRA. Image sets were independently reviewed by 3 readers for the presence, location, and classification of a DAVF. The reported result of the DSA was used as the gold standard against which the performance of the trMRA was measured.
   RESULTS: Forty patients were identified who had undergone DSA and trMRA for evaluation of DAVF, yielding a total of 42 cases. On DSA, the results of 7 cases were normal, 15 cases were performed for surveillance of a previously cured fistula, and a new fistula (14) or persistent (6) fistula was found in 20 cases. Of these 20 fistulas, on DSA, 13 were Borden 1, 2 were Borden II, and 5 were Borden III. In 93% (39/42) of DAVF cases, the 3 readers were unanimous and correct in their independent interpretation of the trMRA, correctly identifying (or excluding) all fistulas and accurately classifying them when encountered.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this small series, trMRA at 3T seems be a reliable technique in the screening and surveillance of DAVF in specific clinical situations.

TI CT Angiography for Brain Death Diagnosis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC ANGIOGRAPHY; TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER; SPIRAL CT;
   ULTRASONOGRAPHY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lack of cerebral circulation is an important confirmatory test for brain death (BID). Conventional angiography remains the standard imaging method, but CT angiography (CTA) is emerging as an alternative. France accepts BID diagnoses relying on a score based on lack of opacification of 7 intracerebral vessels in CTA images. The purpose of this study was to validate the efficiency of this score and to evaluate the sensitivity of a novel 4-point CTA score in confirming BD.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective multicentric study was conducted during 12 months with 105 patients referred for CTA to confirm a clinical diagnosis of BID. Clinical data were recorded. CTA images were interpreted first by local radiologists at the referent center, resulting in a 7-point score based on lack of opacification of the pericallosal and cortical segments of the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs), internal cerebral veins (ICVs), and 1 great cerebral vein per patient and, second, by a consensus panel of 3 expert radiologists, blinded to the initial scores, resulting in novel 4-point scores based on the lack of opacification of the cortical segments of the MCAs and ICVs.
   RESULTS: Injection of contrast medium did not alter renal function. With the initial 7-point score, sensitivity was 62.8%. With the simplified 4-point score, sensitivity was 85.7% and specificity was 100%. Opacification of ICVs was absent in 98.1% of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lack of opacification in the cortical segments of the MCAs and internal veins in CTA is efficient and reliable for confirming BD.

LA English
DT Article
ID ANGIOGRAPHY FOLLOW-UP; ARTERIAL ANEURYSMS; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE;
   CHILDREN; RISK; ENLARGEMENT; FREQUENCY; COILING
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pediatric aneurysms are rare and, thus, relatively poorly understood as compared to those in adults. Our aim was to characterize the clinical, imaging, treatment, and outcome data of patients younger than 19 years diagnosed with intracranial aneurysms at a tertiary care institution.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review of pediatric patients examined at our university hospital between 1981 and 2008.
   RESULTS: We evaluated 77 patients (mean age, 12 years; 40 female, 37 male) with 103 intracranial aneurysms. Patients presented with headache (45%), cranial neuropathies (16%), nausea/vomiting (15%), vision changes (13%), trauma (13%), seizure (4%), or sensory changes (3%). Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred in 25 patients. Thirty-one fusiform aneurysms occurred in 25 patients. Forty-seven saccular aneurysms occurred in 35 patients. Twelve infectious aneurysms occurred in 6 patients. Fifteen traumatic aneurysms occurred in 12 patients. Fifty-nine patients underwent treatment of their aneurysms; 18 patients' conditions were managed conservatively, Nineteen patients underwent primary endovascular coiling, 1 patient had endovascular stent-assisted coiling, 11 patients underwent endovascular parent artery occlusion, 19 patients underwent surgical clipping, and 10 patients had aneurysms trapped and bypassed. Mortality was 1.3%. Morbidity included 8% infarction and 4% new-onset seizures. Six patients developed new aneurysms or had enlargement of untreated aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, intracranial aneurysms of childhood show a female predilection and predominantly saccular morphology. In neurovascular centers where microneurosurgical and endovascular options are available, most children with intracranial aneurysms can be successfully treated with low morbidity and mortality. Fusiform aneurysms require a combined microneurosurgical and endovascular approach more often than saccular aneurysms. The development of new aneurysms in pediatric patients during limited follow-up warrants further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little has been known about the clinical and angiographic follow-up results of stent-only therapy for intracranial vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms (VBDA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, clinical, and angiographic follow-up of stent-only therapy for VBDA.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with 29 VBDAs (11 ruptured, 18 unruptured), not suitable for deconstructive treatment, underwent stent-only therapy. Feasibility, safety, clinical, and angiographic follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. Angiographic outcomes were compared between single-stent and multiple-stent groups.
   RESULTS: All attempted stent placements were successfully accomplished without any treatment-related complication. Of the 11 ruptured VBDAs, 4 were treated by single stents, 6 by double overlapping stents, and I by triple overlapping stents, Of the 18 unruptured VBDAs, 6 were treated by stents, and 12 by double overlapping stents. One patient with a ruptured VBDA, treated by single stent, had rebleeding and died. None of the remaining patients had posttreatment bleeding during follow-up (mean, 28 months; range, 7-50 months). Eight patients with ruptured VBDA and all patients with unruptured VBDA had excellent outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, 0-1). The remaining 2 patients with ruptured VBDA were moderately disabled because of the initial damage. Angiographic follow-up was available in 27 VBDAs, 4 to 42 months (mean, 12 months) after treatment. Follow-up angiograms revealed complete obliteration of the dissecting aneurysm in 12, partial obliteration in 12, stable in 1, enlargement in 1, and in-stent occlusion in 1. Angiographic improvement (complete or partial obliteration) was more frequent in the multiple-stent group (17/17) than in the single-stent group (7/9; P < .05).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this small series, stent-only therapy was safe and effective in the treatment of VBDAs that were not deemed suitable for treatment with parent-artery occlusion.

AB Introduction We aimed to devise a rating method for key frontal and temporal brain regions validated against quantitative volumetric methods and applicable to a range of dementia syndromes.
   Methods Four standardised coronal MR images from 36 subjects encompassing controls and cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were used. After initial pilot studies, 15 regions produced good intra-and inter-rater reliability. We then validated the ratings against manual volumetry and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and compared ratings across the subject groups.
   Results Validation against both manual volumetry (for both frontal and temporal lobes), and against whole brain VBM, showed good correlation with visual ratings for the majority of the brain regions. Comparison of rating scores across disease groups showed involvement of the anterior fusiform gyrus, anterior hippocampus and temporal pole in semantic dementia, while anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal regions were involved in behavioural variant FTD.
   Conclusion This simple visual rating can be used as an alternative to highly technical methods of quantification, and may be superior when dealing with single cases or small groups.

AB Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) are long-term epilepsy associated tumors subdivided into simple and complex variants. The purpose of this study was to relate different DNT components identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to histopathological features and to test the hypothesis that glial nodules as a histopathological feature of complex variants induce an occasional glioma misdiagnosis.
   Clinical, MRI, and histopathologic features of DNTs operated between 1988 and 2008 were reviewed.
   From a total of 61 DNTs, 48 simple and 13 complex variants were identified. Multiple or single pseudocysts in a cortical/subcortical location with small cysts sometimes separated from the tumor represented the glioneuronal element and were found in all DNTs. FLAIR hyperintense tissue was found between pseudocysts but-in neocortical DNTs-also circumscript in deeper tumor parts. Calcification and hemorrhages in this location occurred in four of 13 complex variants, and one of these patients was also the only one with tumor growth. Patients with complex variants had earlier seizure onset, and complex variants were more often located outside the temporal lobe. Although complex variants represented a higher diagnostic challenge, misdiagnoses also occurred in simple variants. One of five of DNTs showed contrast enhancement, which varied on follow-up studies with enhancing parts becoming nonenhancing and vice versa.
   The glioneuronal element is readily identifiable on MRI and should be considered to support the DNT diagnosis. Complex DNT variants have a different clinical profile and a more variable histopathological and MRI appearance; however, misdiagnoses occasionally also occur in simple variants.

   OCTOGENARIANS; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have demonstrated limited benefit with endovascular procedures such as stent placement in octogenarians. We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of intra-arterial recanalization techniques to treat ischemic stroke in patients 80 years or older presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We pooled the data from 4 prospective studies by evaluating intra-arterial recanalization techniques for treatment of ischemic stroke. Clinical and rachologic evaluations were performed before treatment and at 24 hours, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months after treatment, We performed multivariate analyses to evaluate the effect of ages 80 years and older on angiographic recanalization, favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale of 0-2), and mortality rate at I to 3 months.
   RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were treated in the 4 protocols. Of these, 24 were 80 years or older. There was no significant difference between the 2 age groups in sex, initial stroke severity, time to treatment, site of vascular occlusion, and rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In logistic regression analysis, age 80 years or older was associated with a lower likelihood of a favorable outcome (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-1.2; P = 11) and recanalization (OR, 0.36; 95% Cl, 0.12-1.1; P = .07) and with higher mortality rate (OR, 3.17; 95% Cl, 1.05-9.55; P = .04) after adjusting for study protocol. After adjusting for recanalization in addition to study protocol, the older age group still had a lower likelihood of favorable outcomes (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1; P = .07) and higher mortality rates (OR, 3,62; 95% Cl, 1.15-11.36; P = .027.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that patients 80 years and older are at higher risk for poor outcome at 1 to 3 months following intra-arterial recanalization techniques. This relationship is independent of recanalization rate and symptomatic ICH supporting the role of other mechanisms.

   COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity is hypothesized to represent irreversibly infracted tissue (ischemic core) in the setting of acute stroke, Measurement of the ischemic core has implications for both prognosis and therapy. We wished to assess the level of evidence in the literature supporting this hypothesis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature relating to tissue outcomes of DWI hyperintense stroke lesions in humans. The methodologic rigor of studies was evaluated by using criteria set out by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Data from individual studies were also analyzed to determine the prevalence of patients demonstrating lesion progression, no change, or lesion regression compared with follow-up imaging.
   RESULTS: Limited numbers of highly methodologically rigorous studies (Oxford levels 1 and 2) were available. There was great variability in observed rates of DWI lesion reversal (0%-83%), with a surprisingly high mean rate of DWI lesion reversal (24% of pooled patients). Many studies did not include sufficient data to determine the precise prevalence of DWI lesion growth or reversal.
   CONCLUSIONS: The available tissue-outcome evidence supporting the hypothesis that DWI is a surrogate marker for ischemic core in humans is troublingly inconsistent and merits an overall grade D based on the criteria set out by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

TI Cerebellar Atrophy in Essential Tremor Using an Automated Segmentation
   Method
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; DISORDER; VOLUMES; MATTER
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Essential tremor (ET) is a slowly progressive disorder characterized by postural and kinetic tremors most commonly affecting the forearms and hands. Several lines of evidence from physiologic and neuroimaging studies point toward a major role of the cerebellum in this disease. Recently, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been proposed to quantify cerebellar atrophy in ET. However, VBM was not originally designed to study subcortical structures, and the complicated anatomy of the cerebellum may hamper the automatic processing of VBM. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and utility of using automated subcortical segmentation to identify atrophy of the cerebellum and other subcortical structures in patients with ET.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a recently developed automated volumetric method (FreeSurfer) to quantify subcortical atrophy in ET by comparing results obtained with this method with those provided by previous evidence. The study included T1-weighted MR images of 46 patients with ET grouped into those having arm ET (n = 27, a-ET) or head ET (n = 19, h-ET) and 28 healthy controls.
   RESULTS: Results revealed the expected reduction of cerebellar volume in patients with h-ET with respect to healthy controls after controlling for intracranial volume. No significant difference was detected in any other subcortical area.
   CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric data obtained with automated segmentation of subcortical and cerebellar structures approximate data from a previous study based on VBM. The current findings extend the literature by providing initial validation for using fully automated segmentation to derive cerebellar volumetric information from patients with ET.

AB Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-neuroradiological entity, characterized by typical neurological deficits, distinctive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and a usually benign clinical course. Although frequently seen in association with hypertensive conditions, many other predisposing factors, notably cytotoxic and immunosuppressant drugs have been associated with PRES. The aim of this study was to determine differences in the MR appearance of PRES according to various risk factors.
   Thirty consecutive patients with clinical and MRI findings consistent with PRES were included. We identified 24 patients with hypertension-related conditions, including 14 patients with preeclampsia-eclampsia, and six patients without hypertension, in whom PRES was associated with exposition to neurotoxic substances. Lesion distribution, extent of disease, and number of affected brain regions were compared between patients with PRES with and without hypertension, and patients with PRES with and without preeclampsia-eclampsia, respectively.
   No statistically significant differences in distribution of lesions and extent of disease were observed between patients with PRES with or without hypertension, and patients with or without preeclampsia-eclampsia, respectively. The number of affected brain regions was significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia-eclampsia (p = 0.046), and the basal ganglia region was more frequently involved in these patients (p = 0.066).
   Apart from a significant higher number of involved brain regions and a tendency for basal ganglia involvement in patients with PRES associated with preeclampsia-eclampsia, the MRI appearance of patients with PRES does not seem to be influenced by predisposing risk factors.

DT Article
ID LOW-GRADE GLIOMA; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; ADULT PATIENTS; SURVIVAL;
   ASTROCYTOMAS; EXPRESSION; THERAPY; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current classification and grading of primary brain tumors has significant limitations. Our aim was to determine whether the relative cerebral volume (rCBV) measurements in gliomas may serve as an adjunct to histopathologic grading, with a hypothesis that rCBV values are more accurate in predicting 1-year survival and recurrence.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-tour patients with gliomas (WHO grade I-IV, 27 astrocytomas, 7 tumors with oligodendroglial components) underwent contrast-enhanced MR rCBV measurements before treatment. The region of interest and the single pixel with the maximum CBV value within the tumors were normalized relative to the contralateral normal tissue (rCBV(mean) and rCBV(max), respectively). Karnofsky performance score and progression-free survival (PFS) were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curves and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were conducted for CBV and histologic grade (WHO grade).
   RESULTS: Significant correlations were detected only when patients with oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas were excluded. The rCBV(mean) and rCBV(max) in the astrocytomas were 3.5 +/- 2.9 and 3.7 +/- 2.7. PFS correlated with rCBV parameters (r = -0.54 to -0.56, P <= .009). WHO grade correlated with rCBV values (r = 0.65, P <= .0002). rCBV(max) >4.2 was found to be a significant cutoff value for recurrence prediction with 77.8% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity (P = .0001). rCBV(max) <= 3.8 was a significant predictor for 1-year survival (93.7% sensitivity, 72.7% specificity, P = .0002). The relative risk for shorter PFS was 11.1 times higher for rCBV(max) >4.2 (P = .0006) and 6.7 times higher for WHO grade >II (P = .05). The combined CBV-WHO grade classification enhanced the predictive value for recurrence/progression (P < .0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: rCBV values in astrocytomas but not tumors with oligodendroglial components are predictive for recurrence and 1-year survival and may be more accurate than histopathologic grading.

TI Crossed Cerebellar Diaschisis in Acute Stroke Detected by Dynamic
   Susceptibility Contrast MR Perfusion Imaging
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOOD-FLOW; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; HYPOPERFUSION; INFARCTION; ACETAZOLAMIDE;
   TIME
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD), the decrease in blood flow and metabolism in the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to a supratentorial stroke, is frequently reported on positron-emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) but is rarely described with MR perfusion techniques. This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of CCD observed in acute stroke by retrospective review of a research data base of patients with acute stroke evaluated by diffusion-weighted (DWI) and dynamic contrast susceptibility perfusion MR imaging (PWI).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: PWI scans of 301 consecutive patients with acute stroke and positive DWI abnormality from a research data base were reviewed. Contralateral cerebellar hypoperfusion was identified by inspection of time-to-peak (TTP) maps for asymmetry with an absence of cerebellar abnormalities on T2-weighted scans, DWI, or disease of the vertebrobasilar system on MR angiography. In a subset of the cases, quantitative analysis of perfusion scans was performed using an arterial input function and singular value decomposition (SVD) to generate cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps.
   RESULTS: A total of 47 of 301 cases (15.61 %) met the criteria of CCD by asymmetry of cerebellar perfusion on TTP maps. On quantitative analysis, there was corresponding reduction of CBF by 22.75 +/- 10.94% (range, 7.45% to 52.13%) of the unaffected cerebellar hemisphere).
   CONCLUSIONS: MR perfusion techniques can be used to detect CCD, though the frequency presented in this series is lower than that commonly reported in the PET/SPECT literature. Nevertheless, with its role in acute stroke and noninvasive nature, MB perfusion may be a viable alternative to PET or SPECT to study the phenomenon and clinical consequences of supratentorial stroke with CCD.

TI Clinical and Angiographic Results of Coiling of 196 Very Small (<= 3 mm)
   Intracranial Aneurysms
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English

ID GUGLIELMI DETACHABLE COILS; ENDOVASCULAR COILING; RUPTURE; EMBOLIZATION;
   OUTCOMES; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coiling of very small (<= 3 mm) aneurysms is considered controversial because of technical difficulties and a higher rate of procedural aneurysm ruptures. In this study, we report clinical and angiographic results Of Coiling of aneurysms 3 mm or smaller in comparison with larger aneurysms in a large, single-center cohort of patients,
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and July 2008, a total of 1295 aneurysms were selectively occluded with coils. Of 1295 aneurysms, 196 (15.1%) in 187 patients were very small. Of 196 aneurysms, 149 (76%) had ruptured and 47 (24%) had not ruptured. There were 51 males (27%) and 136 females (73%). Mean age was 54.7 years (age range, 11-78 years).
   RESULTS: Procedural morbidity rate was 2.1% and mortality rate, 1.1%. Procedural rupture occurred in 15 of 196 aneurysms (7.7%). In 13 of 15 procedural ruptures, this had no adverse effect oil outcome. Early recurrent hemorrhage of the coiled aneurysm occurred in 2 patients (1.1%). Compared with larger aneurysms, in very small aneurysms more often a procedural rupture occurred (7.7% versus 3.6%; P=.018). Procedural morbidity rate was lower (3.2% versus 5.5%), but this was not significant (P=.26). Retreatment rate consisted predominantly of clipping soon after incomplete coiling and was lower than in larger aneurysms (5.1% versus 10.0%; P=.041). Other characteristics were not significantly different.
   CONCLUSIONS: Coiling of very small aneurysms was technically feasible, with good results. Although procedural aneurysm rupture was significantly more frequent in very small aneurysms, this did not lead to increased overall morbidity and mortality rates. Retreatment rate was lower than for larger aneurysms.

   ANTERIOR
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An increasing number of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are amenable to endovascular treatment with Onyx. However, reports on complications caused by this technique have been limited. We present the initial Beijing Tiantan Hospital experience with adverse events related to transarterial Onyx embolization for DAVFs.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2005 and February 2008, a total of 40 patients with DAVFs were treated at our institute with Onyx-18. There were 11 women and 29 men with a mean age of 43.15 years (age range, 23-60 years). We reviewed the clinical presentation, angiographic features, treatment, and outcome.
   RESULTS: In 40 patients, total obliteration was achieved in 25 DAVFs (62.5%), with the remaining 15 patients not cured with residual shunts. Complications occurred in 9 patients, 5 DAVFs were located at tentorium, 2 were located at the transverse-sigmoid sinus, 1 was found at the inferior petrosal sinus, and 1 was found at the cavernous sinus, leading to permanent disability in 3 patients (morbidity, 7.5%). Complications included reflexive bradyarrhythmia in 3 (7.5%) patients, hemifacial hypoesthesia in 3 (7.5%) patients, hemifacial palsy in 2 (5%) patients, posterior fossa infarction in 2 (5%) patients, jaw pain in 1 (2.5%) patient, microcatheter gluing in 1 (2.5%) patient, hallucinations in 1 (2.5%) patient, and Onyx migration in 1 (2.5%) patient.
   CONCLUSION: Although complete cure can be achieved by transarterial embolization with Onyx, the potential for serious complications exists with this procedure.

   ASSOCIATION; CONNECTIONS; CONVERSION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional state between normal aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Our goal was to determine if specific temporoparietal regions can predict the time to progress from MCI to AD.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR images from 129 individuals with MCI were analyzed to identify the volume of 14 neocortical and 2 non-neocortical brain regions, comprising the temporal and parietal lobes. In addition, 3 neuropsychological test scores were included to determine whether they would provide independent information. After a mean follow-up time of 5 years, 44 of these individuals had progressed to a diagnosis of AD.
   RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated significant effects for 6 MR imaging regions with the greatest differences being the following: the entorhinal cortex (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, P <.001), inferior parietal lobule (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64, P <.005), and middle temporal gyrus (HR = 0.64, P <.004), indicating decreased risk with larger volumes. A multivariable model showed that a combination of the entorhinal cortex (HR = 0.60, P <.001) and the inferior parietal lobule (HR = 0.62, P <.01) was the best predictor of time to progress to AD. A multivariable model reiterated the importance of including both MR imaging and neuropsychological variables in the final model.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings reaffirm the importance of the entorhinal cortex and present evidence for the importance of the inferior parietal lobule as a predictor of time to progress from MCI to AD. The inclusion of neuropsychological performance in the final model continues to highlight the importance of using these measures in a complementary fashion.

   SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiating between tumors and pseudotumoral lesions by conventional MR imaging may be a challenging question. This study aims to evaluate the potential usefulness and the added value that single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy could provide on this discrimination.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 solid brain lesions were retrospectively included in the study (68 glial tumors and 16 pseudotumoral lesions). Single-voxel spectra at TE 30 ms (short TE) and 136 ms (long TE) were available in all cases. Two groups were defined: "training-set" (56 cases) and "test-set" (28 cases). Tumors and pseudotumors were compared in the training-set with the Mann-Whitney U test. Ratios between resonances were defined as classifiers for new cases, and thresholds were selected with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The added value of spectroscopy was evaluated by 5 neuroradiologists and assessed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
   RESULTS: Differences between tumors and pseudotumors were found in myo-inositol (mlns); P<.01) at short TE, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA; P <.001), glutamine (Glx; P <.01), and choline (CHO; P <.05) at long TE. Classifiers suggested tumor when mlns/NAA ratio was more than 0.9 at short TE and also when CHO/NAA ratio was more than 1.9 at long TE. Classifier accuracy was tested in the test-set with the following results: short TE, 82% (23/28); long TE, 79% (22/28). The neuroradiologists' confidence rating of the test-cases on a 5-point scale (0-4) improved between 5% (from 2.86-3) and 27% (from 2.25-2.86) with spectroscopy (mean, 17%; P <.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ratios of mlns/NAA at short TE and CHO/NAA at long TE provide valuable information to discriminate between brain tumor and pseudotumor by improving neuroradiologists' accuracy and confidence.

TI Angiography Reveals That Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Vascular
   Hyperintensities Are Due to Slow Flow, Not Thrombus
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FLAIR MRI; INTRAARTERIAL SIGNAL; STROKE; VESSELS; IMAGES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) vascular hyperintensities (FVH) are commonly encountered on MR imaging studies performed shortly after the onset of acute ischemic stroke. Prior reports have speculated regarding the pathogenesis of this finding, yet definitive correlative angiographic studies have not been performed. We studied the pathophysiologic and hemodynamic correlates of FVH on conventional angiography and concurrent MR imaging sequences.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of FLAIR and gradient-refocused echo MR imaging sequences acquired immediately before conventional angiography for acute stroke was conducted in a blinded fashion. The presence, location, and morphology of FVH were noted and correlated with markers of thrombotic occlusion and collateral flow on angiography. Angiographic collaterals were graded on a 5-point scale incorporating extent and hemodynamic aspects.
   RESULTS: A prospective ischemic stroke registry of 632 patients was searched to identify 74 patients (mean age, 63.4 +/- 20 years; 48% women) having undergone FLAIR sequences immediately before angiography. Median time from FLAIR to angiography was 2.9 hours (interquartile range, 1.1-4.7 hours). FVH were present in 53/74 (72%) of all acute stroke cases with subsequent angiography. FVH distal to an arterial occlusion were associated with a high grade of leptomeningeal collateral blood flow.
   CONCLUSIONS: FVH are observed in areas of blood flow proximal and distal to stenosis or occlusion and are noted with more extensive collateral circulation.

AB Extraventricular neurocytoma (EVN) is rare entity with similar biologic behavior and histopathologic characteristics to neurocytomas that occur in the lateral ventricles, according to the 2007 World Health Organization classification. We report the cases of 3 patients with extraventricular neurocytoma, which presented as large tumors in the left frontal and parietal lobes and in the sellar region. MR imaging showed cystic degeneration, calcification and/or hemorrhage, intense enhancement, and perilesional edema. EVN should be considered in the differential diagnosis for large, heterogeneous, enhancing brain tumors that occur in young people.

Image analysis was performed by 2 radiologists independently, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was computed. Histologic diagnosis was obtained in every patient. For comparison of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), a paired 2-tailed Student t test with a Bonferroni correction was used.
   RESULTS: In 136 patients, a primary parotid gland tumor was confirmed by histology. Among the observers, a high correlation was calculated (0.98). ADC values of pleomorphic adenomas were significantly higher than those of all other entities, except for myoepithelial adenomas (P = .054). ADC values of Warthin tumors were different from those of myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas (P < .001, 0,013, and .037, respectively). Mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas were not differentiable from Warthin tumors (P = .094, .396, and .604, respectively).
   CONCLUSION: epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.

TI Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum: An MR Imaging Analysis of Associated
   Abnormalities in the Fetus
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS; FETAL AGENESIS;
   CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ANOMALIES; MALFORMATIONS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anomalies associated with callosal agenesis (ACC) found postnatally have been well documented. However, to our knowledge, no detailed MR imaging analysis of associated anomalies has been reported in a large cohort of fetuses with ACC. This study will assess those anomalies and compare them with postnatal cohorts of ACC, to identify associated fetal brain abnormalities that may give insight into etiology and outcome.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of ACC diagnosed on fetal MR imaging during an 11-year period were retrospectively reviewed, including fetal MR imaging, postnatal MR imaging, and autopsy findings. Neurodevelopmental outcome was classified as poor in children with seizures and/or severe neurodevelopmental impairment or in cases of neonatal death.
   RESULTS: Twenty-nine cases of ACC were identified. Median gestational age was 26.14 weeks (range, 19.71-36.43 weeks). Twenty-three fetuses had delayed sulcation and/or too-numerous cortical infoldings (abnormal morphology). Fifteen fetuses had cerebellar and/or brain stem abnormalities. Fetal MR imaging findings suggested a genetic syndrome in 5 fetuses and an acquired etiology or genetic/ metabolic disorder in 2 fetuses. Findings were confirmed in 8 cases with postnatal MR imaging, except for delayed sulcation and small vermis, and in 4 cases with autopsy, except for periventricular nodular heterotopia and abnormalities in areas not examined by autopsy. Neurodevelopmental outcome was good in 7 and poor in 9 children. Abnormal sulcal morphology and/or infratentorial abnormalities were present in those with poor outcome and absent in those with good outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACC is infrequently isolated in fetuses. Abnormal sulcation is common and suggests more diffuse white matter dysgenesis in these fetuses.

TI Variability of Homotopic and Heterotopic Callosal Connectivity in
   Partial Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum: A 3T Diffusion Tensor Imaging
   and Q-Ball Tractography Study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WHITE-MATTER ARCHITECTURE; LIVING HUMAN BRAIN; FIBER TRACTOGRAPHY;
   TRACKING; TOPOGRAPHY; MATURATION; PATHWAYS; ANATOMY; TRACTS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known about the anatomic connectivity of callosal axons in individuals with partial agenesis of the corpus callosum (pAgCC). We used tractography based on both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) to investigate interhemispheric white matter connectivity in pAgCC.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and HARDI were performed at 3T on 6 individuals with pAgCC and 8 control subjects. For HARDI analysis, a Q-ball reconstruction method capable of visualizing multiple intravoxel fiber orientations was used. In both DTI and HARDI, whole-brain 3D fiber tractography was performed by using deterministic streamline algorithms. Callosal fibers were then segmented to identify separately connections between homologous cortical regions (homotopic fibers) and nonhomologous regions (heterotopic fibers) by using manually drawn regions of interest.
   RESULTS: In control individuals, we observed densely connected homotopic fibers. However, in individuals with pAgCC, we identified not only homotopic connections but also heterotopic connections in 4 of 6 subjects. Furthermore, the observed homotopic connections in pAgCC did not necessarily correlate with the position or size of the residual callosum. The nature of homotopic and heterotopic connectivity varied considerably among subjects with pAgCC, and HARDI recovered more callosal fibers than DTI.
   CONCLUSION: Individuals with pAgCC demonstrate a remarkable diversity of callosal connectivity, including a number of heterotopic tracts that are absent in healthy subjects. The patterns of their callosal connections cannot be predicted from the appearance of their callosal fragments on conventional MR imaging. More tracts and more extensive fibers within tracts are recovered with HARDI than with DTI.

TI MR Imaging Features of Isolated Cortical Vein Thrombosis: Diagnosis and
   Follow-Up
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS; DURAL SINUS THROMBOSIS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To our knowledge, very few MR imaging data have been reported in isolated cortical venous thrombosis (ICoVT). The purpose of this study was to describe MR imaging features, including T2*gradient-echo (GE) sequence, in presumed ICoVT.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging examinations were performed in 8 patients with ICoVT (MR venography was performed in all patients and digital substraction angiography in 4) at the time of diagnosis and during the follow-up at 15 days (4 patients) and at 3 (8 patients), 6 (6 patients), 12 (3 patients), and 18 months (1 patient). We assessed the presence of a magnetic susceptibility effect (MSE) on T2*GE imaging at each site of cerebral venous thrombosis and the presence or absence of a normal flow void and iso-, hypo-, or hyperintense signal intensity on T1, T2, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Parenchymal signal-intensity changes were also assessed on the same sequences.
   RESULTS: MSE was detected on T2*GE imaging at the site of a cortical vein in all subjects at the first MR imaging examination. The occluded vein appeared as hyperintense in 3 patients, iso- to slightly hyperintense in 1 on T1, hypointense in 6 on FLAIR images, and as signal-intensity loss on DWI in 3. At follow-up, persisting signal-intensity abnormalities on T2*GE imaging were detected at the venous sites in all patients, whereas signal-intensity changes on T1- and T2-weighted images were no longer present. Parenchymal hyperintensities on FLAIR and DWI (increased apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) were observed in close vicinity to the thrombosis in 6/8 patients. Petechial hemorrhages (n = 3) or hematoma (n = 2) was present on T2*GE imaging in 5/8 patients. During the follow-up, all cerebral tissue signal-intensity changes on T1, T2, and FLAIR images decreased both in volume and intensity. ADC values normalized within the tissue after 3 months in all patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: On T2*GE imaging, MSE of hemoglobin products within the thrombus was observed both at the early and late phases of ICoVT and appears to be of high diagnostic value compared with the other signal intensity changes detected on standard MR imaging.

TI 3T MR Imaging of Postoperative Recurrent Middle Ear Cholesteatomas:
   Value of Periodically Rotated Overlapping Parallel Lines with Enhanced
   Reconstruction Diffusion-Weighted MR Imaging
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TURBO SPIN-ECHO; RESIDUAL CHOLESTEATOMA; SINGLE-SHOT; SURGERY;
   OPERATION; PLANAR
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR diagnostic of postoperative recurrent cholesteatomas is difficult, Our purpose was to compare multishot fast spin-echo periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) with array spatial sensitivity encoding technique (ASSET) single-shot echo-planar DWI and late postgadolinium T1-weighted MR imaging for the detection of postoperative recurrent middle ear cholesteatomas with a 3T imaging unit.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with suggested postoperative recurrent middle ear cholesteatoma underwent 3T MR imaging with PROPELLER DWI, ASSET echo-planar DWI, and late postgadolinium T1-weighted MR imaging. Three radiologists (2 seniors, 1 fellow) analyzed unlabeled images for Visualization of recurrence. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement was assessed by using the Cohen kappa statistic test. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were assessed for the 3 observers.
   RESULTS: Nineteen recurrent cholesteatomas were diagnosed. PROPELLER interobserver agreement was very good (1, 0.89, 0.89) among the 3 observers, Intraobserver agreement between PROPELLER and T1-weighted imaging was very good to moderate (0.88, 0.57, 0.58). PROPELLER DWI provided less interobserver variability than other sequences, and the best sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value.
   CONCLUSIONS: On a 3T imaging unit, multishot fast spin-echo PROPELLER DWI allows an easier detection of postoperative recurrent middle ear cholesteatoma than T1-weighted imaging by reducing artifacts and by its better contrast, DWI with PROPELLER is diagnostically robust and accurate.

ID CEREBRAL VASOSPASM; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; ANEURYSM; INFARCTS
AB We retrospectively evaluated computed tomography angiography (CTA) and perfusion imaging (CTP) of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) for any correlation between degree of vasospasm and perfusion deficit.
   Sequentially performed CTP and CTA of 41 patients at least at the third day of postbleeding were reviewed for vasospasm and perfusion deficit throughout the anterior and middle cerebral arteries and corresponding territories. Vasospasm was noted comparing the contralateral normal ones or extradural components of the vessel itself and graded to negative, mild, moderate, and severe as luminal narrowing none, < 25%, between 25% and 50%, and a parts per thousand yen50%, respectively. CTP abnormality was noted using cerebral blood flow and volume and mean transit time maps.
   Of 41 patients, 20 had no vasospasm; 15 had mild to moderate and six had severe vasospasm. Three of 20 patients with no vasospasm (15%), four of 15 patients with mild to moderate vasospasm (26%), and five of six patients with severe vasospasm (83%) had perfusion abnormality. Perfusion abnormalities noted were ischemia, infarction, and hyperperfusion. Perfusion abnormality without vasospasm was observed in the watershed areas and adjacent to sulcal clots.
   In SAH patients, if there is a macrovascular vasospasm with luminal narrowing a parts per thousand yen50%, there is a high likelihood (83%) of perfusion abnormality in the territory of the vasospastic vessel. There may also be perfusion abnormality without macrovascular vasospasm in the watershed areas or in the vicinity of sulcal clots.

TI MR Imaging of Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome, Orbital Cellulitis, and
   Orbital Lymphoid Lesions: The Role of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID GRADE CEREBRAL GLIOMAS; ECHO-PLANAR; SPIN-ECHO; BRAIN; DIFFERENTIATION;
   COEFFICIENTS; PSEUDOTUMOR; DISORDERS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Orbital inflammatory syndrome (OIS) has clinical features that overlap with orbital lymphoid lesions and orbital cellulitis. Prompt diagnosis is needed in all 3 conditions because the management of each one differs greatly. CT and MR imaging, though useful, do not always distinguish among these conditions. The aim of this study was to identify the role of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in differentiating these 3 diagnoses.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of orbital MR imaging was conducted. T1- and T2-weighted and postcontrast images were analyzed. Region-of-interest analysis was performed by using measurements in areas of abnormality seen on conventional MR imaging sequences and measurements of the ipsilateral thalamus for each patient. The DWI signal intensity of the lesion was expressed as a percentage of average thalamic intensity in each patient. Similarly, lesion apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and lesion-thalamus ADC ratios were calculated. Statistical significance was determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test, and post hoc pairwise comparisons, by the Mann-Whitney U test for DWI-intensity ratio, ADC, and ADC ratio.
   RESULTS: A significant difference was noted in DWI intensities, ADC, and ADC ratio between OIS, orbital lymphoid lesions, and orbital cellulitis (P <.05). Lymphoid lesions were significantly brighter than OIS, and OIS lesions were significantly brighter than cellulitis. Lymphoid lesions showed lower ADC than OIS and cellulitis. A trend was seen toward lower ADC in OIS than in cellulitis (P = .17).
   CONCLUSIONS: DWI may help differentiate OIS from lymphoid lesions and cellulitis and may allow more rapid management.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whether treatment of small asymptomatic aneurysms is appropriate or not remains controversial. We performed a retrospective study on the procedural morbidity and mortality of coil embolization of small asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) to obtain a more generalized estimate of procedural risk.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 435 small (maximum diameter <= 7 mm) asymptomatic UIAs in 370 patients were treated by coil embolization. Aneurysm sizes were determined by using 3D angiograms. We assessed procedure-related morbidity and mortality, immediate postprocedural angiographic results, short-term imaging follow-up results, and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: Initial aneurysm occlusion was complete in 334 aneurysms, near complete in 78, and incomplete in 22. One internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that ruptured during the procedure was treated with parent artery occlusion, Two hundred wide-neck aneurysms were coiled with the aid of various neck-remodeling techniques, The 44 procedure-related complications were the following: 24 thromboembolisms, 11 coil protrusions or prolapses into the parent vessel, 4 intraprocedural ruptures, 3 device-related complications, and 2 femoral-access complications. We had a total of 44 (10.1 %) procedure-related complications with only I leading to persistent neurologic deficit. Procedure-related permanent morbidity and mortality were 0.27% (1/370) and 0%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this series of small unruptured asymptomatic aneurysms, endovascular treatment was achieved with good short-term angiographic outcome and low permanent neurologic impairment. The goal of this study was not to provide a conclusion about treatment guidelines for small UIA but rather to help guide future recommendations by presenting a more generalized estimate of endovascular treatment risk than is currently available.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microinvasive tumor cells, which are not detected on conventional imaging, contribute to poor prognoses for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO grade IV). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise in being able to detect this infiltration. This study aims to detect a difference in diffusion properties between GBM (infiltrative) and brain metastases (noninfiltrative).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 49 tumors (30 GBM, 19 metastases), DTI measures (p, q, L, and fractional anisotropy [FA]) were calculated for regions of gross tumor (excluding hemorrhagic and necrotic core), periturnoral edema, peritumoral margin (edema most adjacent to tumor), adjacent normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and contralateral white matter. Parametric and nonparametric statistical tests were used to determine significance, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: Mean values of p, L, and FA from regions of signal-intensity abnormality differed from those of normal brain in both tumors. The mean q value did not differ significantly compared with that in normal brain in any region in metastases or in adjacent NAWM of GBM. For GBM compared with metastases, q and FA were significantly lower in gross tumor (P < .001) and q was significantly lower in periturnoral margin (P < .001), which may be due to tumor infiltration. Significant overlap was present, which was reflected in the ROC curve analyses (area under the curve values from 0.732 to 0,804).
   CONCLUSIONS: DTI may be used to help differentiate between GBM and brain metastases. The results also suggest that DTI has the potential to assist in detecting infiltrative tumor cells in surrounding brain.

AB We aim to establish norms of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in 20 different regions of the brain in healthy human volunteers.
   Thirty-one individuals were examined for ADC and FA in 20 regions of the brain using a single-shot, spin echo, echo planar diffusion tensor imaging sequence with 32 directions at 3 T. FA and ADC maps were computed using the Philips PRIDE tool, and regions of interest were drawn at 20 different locations in the brain. Relationships of FA and ADC with age and gender were explored.
   We found a negative correlation between age and FA in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and forceps minor. There were no gender differences. The cerebral peduncle, the middle cerebellum, and cingulum had the highest variation in FA, while fornix, optic radiation, and optic tract had the highest variation in ADC.
   We provide a table of normative FA and ADC measurements in 20 brain regions of potential clinical relevance to the diagnosis and monitoring of specific neurological diseases.

AB Introduction Despite the high grade of standardisation of study protocols, there is still room for variability among the centres in specific treatment aspects. We evaluated the treatment risk in stent-protected angioplasty of the carotid versus endarterectomy (SPACE) associated with the specific patient enrolment rates of the centres.
   Materials and methods The analysed endpoints were ipsilateral stroke or death [primary outcome event (pOE)] and any stroke or death [secondary outcome event (sOE)] until 30 days after treatment. A binary logistic regression analysis with random effects was performed separately for each treatment arm. The centres were secondarily categorised in three classes: I) >= 25 patients enrolled, II) ten to 24 patients and III) <10 patients and a hierarchic log linear model was fitted to test the three-way interaction of treatment, number of patients per class and outcome.
   Results The random effects logistic regression analysis in the carotid artery stenting (CAS) arm proved a significant increase in pOE with decreasing number of patients enrolled (-0.0190 +/- 0.0085, p=0.025, deviance 35.7 with 32 df), whereas no such effect was found in the carotid endartectomy (CEA) arm (-0.0190 +/- 0.008, p=0.24, deviance 39.78 with 32 df). In the log linear model, there was a significant interaction between treatment, number of patients per centre and sOE (p=0.023). The odds ratios for sOE in the enrolment classes (CAS vs. CEA) were 0.98 (95% CI 0.50-1.94, p=0.95) for class I, 1.13 (95% CI 0.47-2.77, p=0.77) for class II and 11.56 (95% CI 1.40-253.45, p=0.01) for class III centres.
   Conclusion Despite rigorous standardisation and quality requirements for operator qualification, there seemed to be a decrease in complication rate with increasing patient enrolment numbers in the CAS arm while this signal could not be detected in the CEA arm of SPACE.

   SIZE; RISK
AB BACKGROUND
   International Consensus Criteria (ICC) consider right-to-left shunt (RLS) present when Transcranial Doppler (TCD) detects even one microbubble (mu B). Spencer Logarithmic Scale (SLS) offers more grades of RLS with detection of >30 mu B corresponding to a large shunt. We compared the yield of ICC and SLS in detection and quantification of a large RLS.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS
   We prospectively evaluated paradoxical embolism in consecutive patients with ischemic strokes or transient ischemic attack (TIA) using injections of 9 cc saline agitated with 1 cc of air. Results were classified according to ICC [negative (no mu B), grade I (1-20 mu B), grade II (>20 mu B or "shower" appearance of mu B), and grade III ("curtain" appearance of mu B)] and SLS criteria [negative (no mu B), grade I (1-10 mu B), grade II (11-30 mu B), grade III (31100 mu B), grade IV (101300 mu B), grade V (>300 mu B)]. The RLS size was defined as large (>4 mm) using diameter measurement of the septal defects on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).
   RESULTS
   TCD comparison to TEE showed 24 true positive, 48 true negative, 4 false positive, and 2 false negative cases (sensitivity 92.3%, specificity 92.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) 85.7%, negative predictive value (NPV) 96%, and accuracy 92.3%) for any RLS presence. Both ICC and SLS were 100% sensitive for detection of large RLS. ICC and SLS criteria yielded a false positive rate of 24.4% and 7.7%, respectively when compared to TEE.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Although both grading scales provide agreement as to any shunt presence, using the Spencer Scale grade III or higher can decrease by one-half the number of false positive TCD diagnoses to predict large RLS on TEE.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visual field defects sometimes occur after temporal resection surgery. Our purpose was to evaluate the correlation between visual field defects caused by temporal lobe resection and the degree of resection of the Meyer loop, as assessed by diffusion tensor tractography.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 14 patients who underwent temporal resection for temporal lobe epilepsy. We obtained presurgical tractographies and then measured the distance between the temporal tip and the anterior limit of the Meyer loop (T-M distance). The degree of resection of the Meyer loop was defined as the distance from the anterior limit of the Meyer loop to the posterior limit of the temporal lobe resection (M-R distance). This was calculated by subtracting the T-M distance from the measured distance between the temporal tip and the posterior limit of the resection (T-R distance).
   RESULTS: The mean T-M distance was 36.6 mm. The interindividual variation of the distance ranged from 30.0 to 43.2 mm. Although there was no statistically significant correlation between the extent of the visual field defect and the T-R distance, there was a statistically significant correlation between the degree of the visual field defect and the M-R distance.
   CONCLUSION: The range of interindividual variation for the position of the Meyer loop was rather large, indicating that this variation is the key factor in visual field defects after temporal lobectomy, and the visual field defect appears to be predicted by presurgical tractography. Evaluation of the Meyer loop through the use of tractography seems to be a feasible method, which can be used to predict the visual field defect after temporal lobe resection.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent systems for intracranial use are continuously improved. We report our initial experience using a new self-expanding easy-to-place nitinol stent (Enterprise) in the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January and October 2007, 16 aneurysms in 15 patients were treated with stent assistance, Aneurysm size was a mean of 13.2 mm (median, 12 mm; range, 7-30 mm). Eight aneurysms had reopened after prior coiling, and 8 aneurysms were primarily treated, 1 after acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Response to antiplatelet premedication was tested with a P2Y12 assay before stent placement. On a 3D angiographic workstation, stent placement was simulated to assess vessel caliber and appropriate stent length.
   RESULTS: In all aneurysms, the stent could be placed at the exact location as predicted from the computer simulation. Stent placement proved to be technically easy without the need for recapture in all patients, Although placement of the microcatheter through the stent struts and subsequent coil placement was challenging in some patients, coiling after stent placement resulted in complete or near-complete occlusion in all aneurysms. There were no technical or clinical complications. At 6 months, angiographic follow-up in 14 aneurysms revealed 4 aneurysms recanalized to 80% occlusion, 3 of which were additionally coiled.
   CONCLUSION: In this small series, delivery and deployment of the Enterprise stent was technically easy. There were no technical or clinical complications. The device was valuable in the treatment of wide-neck aneurysms. The need for antiplatelet medication in patients treated with this and other stents remains a significant disadvantage.

AB Introduction We report our first clinical experience with a CE-marked flexible monorail balloon-expandable stent for treatment of high-grade intracranial stenoses.
   Methods Between April 2006 and November 2007 21 patients with symptomatic intracranial stenoses (> 70%) were treated with the PHAROS stent. In seven patients, the procedure was performed during acute stroke intervention. Procedural success, clinical complication rates and midterm follow-up data were prospectively recorded.
   Results During a median follow-up period of 7.3 months one additional patient died of an unknown cause 3 months after the intervention. A patient with a significant residual stenosis presented with a new stroke after further progression of the residual stenosis. None of the successfully treated patients experienced ipsilateral stroke.
   Conclusion Recanalization of intracranial stenoses with the balloon-expandable Pharos stent is technically feasible. The periprocedural complication rate and mid-term follow-up results were in the range of previously reported case series. This pilot study was limited by the small sample size and severe morbidity of the included patients. Final evaluation of the efficacy of Pharos stent treatment demands further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND
   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can aid clinical. assessment of brain changes potentially correlated with Alzheimer disease (AD). MRI traits may improve our ability to identify genes associated with AD-outcomes. We evaluated semi-quantitative MRI measures as endophenotypes for genetic studies by assessing their association with AD in families from the Multi-Institutional Research in Alzheimer Genetic Epidemiotogy (MIRAGE) Study.
   METHODS
   Discordant siblings from multiple ethnicities were ascertained through a single affected proband. Semi-quantitative MRI measures were obtained for each individual. The association between continuous/ordinal MRI traits and AD were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Medical. history and Apolipoprotein E (APOE)epsilon 4 status were evaluated as potential confounders.
   RESULTS
   Comparisons of 214 affected and 234 unaffected subjects from 229 sibships reveated that general cerebral atrophy, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and mediotemporat atrophy differed significantly between groups (each at P < .0001) and varied by ethnicity. Age at MRI and duration of AD confounded all associations between AD and MRI traits. Among unaffected sibs, the presence of at least one APOE epsilon 4 allele and MRI infarction was associated with more WMH after adjusting for age at MRI.
   CONCLUSION
   The strong association between MRI traits and AD suggests that MRI traits may be informative endophenotypes for basic and clinical. studies of AD. In particular, WMH may be a marker of vascular disease that contributes to AD pathogenesis.

   TISSUES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   We attempted to measure DTI parameters of the brainstem pyramidal tract using two approaches, ie, simple ROI and tract-specific analyses. Results obtained for healthy subjects and ALS patients were compared.
   METHODS
   DTI was performed using a single shot SE-EPI with 25 noncollinear diffusion gradient directions (b = 1000 second/mm(2)) and with no diffusion gradient on a 3.0-T MR system in 10 ALS patients and in 8 age- and sex-matched normal controls. To delineate the brainstem pyramidal tract, tractography was performed using two ROIs, ie, a seed ROI at the cerebral peduncle (ROI-1) and a target ROI at the Lower pons (ROI-2). ROI-1 was subsequently restricted to voxels that contained streamlines in the tract reconstruction, thus creating a sub-ROI.
   RESULTS
   Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity values were highly reproducible by tract specific analysis, whereas simple ROI analysis yielded larger variabilities between operators. FA values were significantly tower in ALS patients than in normal controls in the tractography-derived sub-ROI (P =.01), but not in the seed or target ROIs.
   CONCLUSIONS
   These results suggest, compared with simple ROI analysis, that tract-specific analysis using DTI fiber-tracking is more reliable and sensitive for detecting upper motor neuron pathology in ALS.

AB PURPOSE
   This study aims to assess cerebral metabolites in school-aged autistic patients through proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
   METHODS
   This case-control study included 10 right-handed mate children (median age, 9.53 years +/- 1.80) with autism according to DSM-IV criteria, and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched healthy controls (median age, 8.52 years +/- 1.42). Imaging was performed on a 1.5-T scanner utilizing a single voxel point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) technique (TR = 1,500 ms, TE = 30 ms). Four cerebral areas were evaluated: bilateral anterior cingulate, left striatum, left cerebellar hemisphere, and left frontal lobe. Peak areas and ratios to creatine (Cr) of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and myo-inositol (mI) were analyzed.
   RESULTS
   Compared with controls, autistic children showed a significant increase in ml (P = .021) and Cho (P = .042) peak areas in anterior cingulate and in mI/Cr ratio in anterior cingulate (P = .037) and left striatum (P = .035). The remaining metabolites and ratios were not significantly different between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS
   This study found a statistically significant increase in myo-inositol and choline in anterior cingulate and left striatum of autistic children compared with controls. In contrast to previous studies, NAA peak area and NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios had, no statistically significant decrease in any of the 4brain regions.

AB Introduction We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study white matter integrity in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
   Methods The subjects comprised 20 patients (9 men, 11 women) with FTD and 17 age-matched healthy controls (9 men, 8 women). Based on the data obtained from DTI, we performed tractography of the major cerebral pathways, including the pyramidal tracts, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF) and uncinate fasciculi (UF). We measured the values of fractional anisotropy (FA) in each fiber and statistically compared the findings in patients with those in controls.
   Results We found a significant decrease in FA values in the selected association fibers as well as anterior fibers of the CC in the patients with FTD. The greatest decrease in mean FA of the UF was seen in advanced FTD. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in FA in the bilateral pyramidal tracts.
   Conclusion The features of FTD from the view point of cerebral white matter damage were revealed by tractography based on DTI. DTI is therefore considered to be a useful method, and may provide clues to elucidating the pathogenesis of FTD.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the treatment of carotid atherosclerosis, the rate of stenosis and characteristics of plaque should be assessed to diagnose vulnerable plaques that increase the risk for cerebral infarction. We performed carotid black-blood (BB) MR imaging to diagnose plaque components and assess plaque hardness based on MR signals.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three images of BB-MR imaging per plaque were obtained from 70 consecutive patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to generate T1- and T2-weighted images. To evaluate the relative signal intensity (rSI) of plaque components and the relationship between histologic findings and symptoms, we prepared sections at 2-mm intervals from 34 intact plaques. We then calculated the relative overall signal intensity (roSI) of 70 plaques to assess the relationship between MR signal intensity and plaque hardness and symptoms.
   RESULTS: The characteristics of rSI values on T1- and T2-weighted images of fibrous cap (FC), fibrosis, calcification, myxomatous tissue, lipid core (LC) with intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), and LC without IPH differed. Symptomatic plaques were associated with FC disruption (P < .001) and LC with IPH (P < .05). The roSI on T1-weighted images was significantly higher for soft than nonsoft plaques. When the roSI cutoff value was set at 1.25 (mean of the roSI), soft plaques were diagnosed with 79.4% sensitivity and 84.4% specificity. The roSI was also significantly higher for symptomatic than for asymptomatic plaques. Soft and nonsoft plaques as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques did not significantly differ on T2-weighted images.
   CONCLUSION: BB-MR imaging can diagnose plaque components and predict plaque hardness. This procedure provides useful information for planning therapeutic strategies of carotid atherosclerosis.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a reliable method of delineating the extent of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Our aim was to retrospectively compare the accuracy of ASPECTS on noncontrast CT, CT angiography (CTA) source images, and CT perfusion maps of cerebral blood volume (CBV) during the first 3 hours of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: First-time patients with MCA stroke who presented <3 hours from symptom onset and were evaluated by noncontrast CT/CTA/CT perfusion, had confirmed acute nonlacunar MCA infarct on diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) within 7 days, and had follow-up angiography were included. Patients were excluded for persistent MCA occlusion or stenosis. Two raters through consensus assigned an ASPECTS on the noncontrast CT, CTA source images, and the section-selective (2 x 12 mm coverage) CT perfusion CBV maps. ASPECTS on follow-up DWI served as the reference standard. For each CT technique, the detection rates of regional infarction, the mean ASPECTS, and the linear correlation to final ASPECTS were determined and compared. P values < .05 were considered significant.
   RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients satisfied the criteria with DWI performed at a mean of 50.3 hours (range, 22-125 hours) post-CT imaging. Of 280 ASPECTS regions, 100 were infarcted on DWI. The accuracy of noncontrast CT, CTA source images, and CT perfusion CBV for detecting regional infarct was 80.0%, 84.3%, and 96.8%, respectively (P < .0001). The mean ASPECTSs of noncontrast CT, CTA source images, CT perfusion CBV, and DWI were 8.4 +/- 1.8, 8.0 +/- 1.8, 6.8 +/- 1.9, and 6.5 +/- 1.8, respectively. The mean noncontrast CT and CTA source image ASPECTS was different from that of DWI (P < .05). Correlation of noncontrast CT, CTA source images, and CT perfusion CBV ASPECTS with final ASPECTS was r(2) = 0.34, r(2) = 0.42, and r(2) = 0.91, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: In a retrospective cohort of MCA infarcts imaged <3 hours from stroke onset, ASPECTS was most accurately determined on CT perfusion CBV maps.

AB Introduction Since digital subtraction angiography (DSA) carries a low risk of morbidity, and is associated with patient discomfort and higher cost, our objective was to determine whether high-resolution 3-D time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) at 3 T may replace DSA in the follow-up of patients after coiling of an intracranial aneurysm.
   Methods This prospective study included 50 consecutive patients with a ruptured and subsequently coiled intracranial aneurysm. All patients were followed up at a mean of 14 months after coiling with DSA and high-resolution 3-D TOF-MRA at 3 T generating 0.02 mm(3) isotropic voxels. One examiner used DSA and TOF-MR angiograms to assess the need for and risk of retreatment; these data were used to calculate intermodality agreement. Another two examiners independently assessed aneurysm occlusion by DSA and TOF-MRA according to the Raymond scale; these data were used to calculate interobserver agreement.
   Results Discrepancies between DSA and TOF-MRA were found in three patients (intermodality agreement kappa=0.86). While DSA indicated complete aneurysm occlusion, TOF-MRA showed small neck remnants in the three patients. Coils on all DSA projections obscured these three neck remnants. Interobserver agreement was higher for DSA (kappa=0.82) than for TOF-MRA (kappa=0.68), which was in part due to the complexity of the information provided by TOF source images and reconstructions.
   Conclusion 3-D TOF-MRA at 3 T is not only an adjunctive tool but is ready to replace DSA in the follow-up of patients with previously coiled intracranial aneurysms. Additional DSA may only be performed in complex and not clearly laid out aneurysms.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CORD-INJURY; COEFFICIENT; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to investigate the extent and severity of changes in spinal cord diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters in patients with cervical cord injury.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI was performed in 20 symptomatic patients (mean, 45.7 +/- 17.7 years of age; 2 women, 18 men) with cervical spine trauma and 8 volunteers mean, 34.2 +/- 10.7 years of age; 6 men, 2 women). The whole cord and regional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), relative anisotropy (RA), and volume ratio (VR) of patients and volunteers were compared. DTI parameters were calculated in 16 patients. MR imaging demonstrated hemorrhagic cord contusions (n = 6), nonhemorrhagic cord contusions (n = 4), and soft-tissue injury (n = 6). Medical records were reviewed for extent of neurologic deficit.
   RESULTS: Regional ADC values differed significantly between upper and mid and upper and lower (both, P < .004) cervical cord sections. FA was significantly different between upper and lower sections (P < .03). Whole cord ADC values were significantly lower in patients than involunteers (P < .0001). Whole spine FA was not significantly decreased inpatients (P < .06). ADC and FA values were significantly decreased at injury sites when compared with volunteers (P < .031 and .0001, respectively). The greatest differences in whole cord ADC, FA, RA, and VR were in patients with hemorrhagic cord contusions compared with healthy volunteers (P < .0001, .003, .0005, and .008, respectively).
   CONCLUSION: DTI parameters are sensitive markers of cervical cord injury, with ADC showing the greatest sensitivity. Changes in DTI parameters are most marked at injury sites and reflect the severity of cord injury.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the relationship between tumor blood-flow measurement based on perfusion imaging by arterial spin-labeling (ASL-PI) and histopathologic findings in brain tumors.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ASL-PI to examine 35 patients with brain tumors, including 11 gliomas, 9 meningiomas, 9 schwannomas, 1 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 4 hemangioblastomas, and 1 metastatic brain tumor. As an index of tumor perfusion, the relative signal intensity (SI) of each tumor (%Signal intensity) was determined as a percentage of the maximal SI within the tumor per averaged SI within normal cerebral gray matter on ASL-PI. Relative vascular attenuation (%Vessel) was determined as the total microvessel area per the entire tissue area on CD-34-immunostained histopathologic specimens. MIB1 indices of gliomas were also calculated. The differences in %Signal intensity among different histopathologic types and between high- and low-grade gliomas were compared. In addition, the correlations between %Signal intensity and %Vessel or MIB1 index were evaluated in gliomas.
   RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in %Signal intensity were observed between hemangioblastomas versus gliomas (P < .005), meningionnas (P < .05), and schwannomas (P < .005). Among gliomas, %Signal intensity was significantly higher for high-grade than for low-grade tumors (P < .05). Correlation analyses revealed significant positive correlations between %Signal intensity and %Vessel in 35 patients, including all 6 histopathologic types (rs = 0.782, P < .00005) and in gliomas (rs = 0.773, P < .05). In addition, in gliomas, %Signal intensity and MIB1 index were significantly positively correlated (rs = 0.700, P < .05).
   CONCLUSION: ASL-PI may predict histopathologic vascular densities of brain tumors and may be useful in distinguishing between high- and low-grade gliomas and in differentiating hemangioblastomas from other brain tumors.

   IN-VIVO; KINETIC-PARAMETERS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glioma angiogenesis and its different hemodynamic features, which can be evaluated by using perfusion CT (PCT) imaging of the brain, have been correlated with the grade and the aggressiveness of gliomas. Our hypothesis was that quantitative estimation of permeability surface area product (PS), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT) in astroglial brain tumors by using PCT will correlate with glioma grade. High-grade gliomas will show higher PS and CBV as compared with low-grade gliomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCT was performed in 32 patients with previously untreated astroglial tumors (24 high-grade gliomas and 8 low-grade gliomas) by using a total acquisition time of 170 seconds. World Health Organization (WHO) glioma grades were compared with PCT parameter absolute values by using Student or nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were also done for each of the parameters.
   RESULTS: The differences in PS, CBV, and CBF between the low- and high-grade tumor groups were statistically significant, with the low-grade group showing lower mean values than the high-grade group. ROC analyses showed that both CBV (C-statistic 0.930) and PS (C-statistic 0.927) were very similar to each other in differentiating low- and high-grade gliomas and had higher predictability compared with CBF and MTT. Within the high-grade group, differentiation of WHO grade III and IV gliomas was also possible by using PCT parameters, and PS showed the highest C-statistic value (0.926) for the ROC analyses in this regard.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both PS and CBV showed strong association with glioma grading, high-grade gliomas showing higher PS and CBV as compared with low-grade gliomas. Perfusion parameters, especially PS, can also be used to differentiate WHO grade III from grade IV in the high-grade tumor group.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clopidogrel and aspirin are antiplatelet medications used in patients intended for endovascular stent placement. Although various studies have investigated individual responsiveness to clopidogrel in patients undergoing coronary interventions, there are no studies regarding patients undergoing stent placement of supra-aortic arteries supplying the brain. We analyzed platelet function in a near-patient setting to determine the effects of antiplatelet treatment in neurologic patients and correlated the results with clinical outcome after stent placement.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The platelet function of 50 consecutive patients scheduled for neurointerventional stent placement procedures was assessed by using point-of-care testing. All of the patients had symptomatic arteriosclerotic lesions. Clopidogrel effects were tested by impedance aggregometry. Fifty healthy blood donors without clopidogrel medication served as the control group.
   RESULTS: Reference values for responders and nonresponders were established from the results of the healthy control group. Fourteen (28%) of 50 neurologic patients were stratified as clopidogrel nonresponders. Adverse events were registered in 5 (10%) of 50 patients, I of them with a permanent neurologic deficit (1 of 50 [2%]). All 5 of the patients with adverse events were nonresponders. There was a statistically significant correlation between adverse events and clopidogrel nonresponse (Fisher exact test, P =.001).
   CONCLUSION: A significant rate of clopidogrel nonresponders could be identified in the treated patients. Our data strongly suggest a correlation of insufficient clopidogrel-related platelet inhibition with an increased risk of thromboembolic events in supra-aortic stent placement.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To our knowledge, no published studies have examined whole-brain regional differences to identify more discrete volumetric changes in the brains of childhood leukemia survivors. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine regional gray and white matter differences in a group of long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared with a group of healthy controls. Differences in regional white matter volume were expected, given previous reports of white matter changes during treatment for ALL and reduced brain white matter volumes in long-term survivors. Follow-up analyses examined the relationship of regional brain volumes to cognitive function.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 9 long-term survivors of ALL with 14 healthy controls. Survivors of ALL were treated with systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy only, T1 -weighted axial 3D spoiled gradient high-resolution images collected on a 1.5T MR imaging scanner were used for the VBM analysis. Neuropsychological evaluations were conducted within 2 months of the MR imaging to assess cognitive function.
   RESULTS: VBM analysis revealed 2 specific regions of reduced white matter in the right frontal lobes of survivors of ALL compared with healthy controls. Survivors of ALL had lower performances on tests of attention, visual-constructional skills, mental flexibility, and math achievement compared with healthy individuals. Decreased performance on neuropsychological measures was associated with decreased regional white matter volumes. No differences were found between the groups with respect to gray matter regions.
   CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with previous literature describing the long-term cognitive, academic, and imaging findings of survivors of ALL and suggest that right frontal white matter is particularly vulnerable to disruption following intensive chemotherapy for ALL. Future studies should focus on further clarifying the white matter changes observed.

AB Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a severe neurological disorder caused by a dietary deficiency of Vitamin B1 and characterized by consciousness changes, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia. Wernicke's encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency and treatment consists of intravenous thiamine administration. Typically in alcoholic and nonalcoholic patients magnetic resonance shows alterations in the mamillary bodies, medial thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal regions. We report here on a nonalcoholic atypical case of WE which presented with reversible symmetrical lesions in the cranial nerves nuclei and in the cerebellum alongside the classic neuroradiological findings.

AB Intracranial angioplasty and stenting (ICAS) is a therapeutic option in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Adequate follow-up examination is necessary to exclude in-stent restenosis. Conventional intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (ia-DSA) is the current gold standard, but it is an invasive technique and carries the risk of neurological complications. Angiographic CT (ACT) is a new technique that provides a volume dataset of the highest spatial resolution and high contrast resolution derived from a rotational acquisition of a c-arm-mounted flat-panel detector. The feasibility of ACT with intravenous administration of contrast medium (iv-ACT) for follow-up after ICAS is demonstrated. In two patients iv-ACT was performed as a follow-up examination 12 months after ICAS. High-resolution volume data from the rotational acquisitions were processed to provide delineation of the stent lumen as well as imaging of the brain parenchyma and vessels. In both patients the patency of the stent lumen was assessed successfully. In addition, all other brain vessels were displayed in a manner similar to their appearance on CT angiograms. The brain parenchyma was also adequately imaged in a manner similar to its appearance on CT images. We demonstrated the feasibility and diagnostic value of iv-ACT for follow-up imaging after ICAS. This new application has the potential to become the imaging method of choice after ICAS since it not only enables visualization of the patency of the stent lumen but also is minimally invasive and provides additional information about all brain arteries and the brain parenchyma.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

ID WATER DIFFUSION; WEIGHTED MRI; GLIOMAS; ANISOTROPY; GRADE; COEFFICIENT;
   MASSES; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiating between primary cerebral lymphoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) based on conventional MR imaging sequences may be impossible. Our hypothesis was that there are significant differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between lymphoma and GBM, which will allow for differentiation between them.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative diffusion tenser imaging (DTI) was performed in 10 patients with lymphoma and 10 patients with GBM. Regions of interest were placed in only solid-enhancing tumor areas and the contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) to measure the FA and ADC values. The differences in FA and ADC between lymphoma and GBM, as well as between solid-enhancing areas of each tumor type and contralateral NAWM, were analyzed statistically. Cutoff values of FA, FA ratio, ADC, and ADC ratio for distinguishing lymphomas from GBMs were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
   RESULTS: FA and ADC values of lymphoma were significantly decreased compared with NAWM. Mean FA, FA ratio, ADC (X 10(-3) mm(2)/s), and ADC ratios were 0.140 +/- 0.024, 0.25 +/- 0.04, 0.630 +/- 0.155, and 0.83 +/- 0.14 for lymphoma, respectively, and 0.229 +/- 0.069, 0.40 +/- 0.12, 0.963 +/- 0.119, and 1.26 +/- 0.13 for GBM, respectively. All of the values were significantly different between lymphomas and GBM. Cutoff values to differentiate lymphomas from GBM were 0.192 for FA, 0.33 for FA ratio, 0.818 for ADC, and 1.06 for ADC ratio.
   CONCLUSIONS: The FA and ADC of primary cerebral lymphoma were significantly lower than those of GBM. DTI is able to differentiate lymphomas from GBM.

TI Language dysfunction after stroke and damage to white matter tracts
   evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONDUCTION APHASIA; PATHWAYS; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowledge of the anatomic basis of aphasia after stroke has both theoretic and clinical implications by informing models of cortical connectivity and providing data for diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we use diffusion tensor imaging to address the relationship between damage to specific white matter tracts and linguistic deficits after left hemisphere stroke.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients aged 38-77 years with a history of stroke in the left hemisphere underwent diffusion tensor imaging, structural MR imaging, and language testing. All of the patients were premorbidly right handed and underwent imaging and language testing at least 1 month after stroke.
   RESULTS: Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the superior longitudinal and arcuate fasciculi of the left hemisphere, an indication of greater damage to these tracts, were correlated with decreased ability to repeat spoken language. Comprehension deficits after stroke were associated with lower FA values in the arcuate fasciculus of the left hemisphere. The findings for repetition were independent of MR imaging ratings of the degree of damage to cortical areas of the left hemisphere involved in language function. There were no findings for homotopic tracts in the right hemisphere.
   CONCLUSION: This study provides support for a specific role for damage to the superior longitudinal and arcuate fasciculi in the left hemisphere in patients with deficits in repetition of speech in aphasia after stroke.

ID PREEMBOLIZATION FUNCTIONAL-EVALUATION; SUPERSELECTIVE AMYTAL TEST;
   ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; MULTIMODALITY TREATMENT; BRAIN; THERAPY; AVM
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolization of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is commonly used to achieve nidal volume reduction before microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the overall neurologic complication rate in patients undergoing AVM embolization and analyze the factors that may determine increased risk.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with brain AVMs embolized at 1 center from 1995 through 2005. Demographics, including age, sex, presenting symptoms, and clinical condition, were recorded. Angiographic factors including maximal nidal size, presence of deep venous drainage, and involvement of eloquent cortex were also recorded. For each embolization session, the agent used, number of pedicles embolized, the percentage of nidal obliteration, and any complications were recorded. Complications were classified as the following: none, non-neurologic (mild), transient neurologic deficit, and permanent nondisabling and permanent disabling deficits. The permanent complications were also classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were collected pre- and postembolization on all patients. Univariate regression analysis of factors associated with the development of any neurologic complication was performed.
   RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-nine embolization procedures were performed in 192 patients. There were 6 Spetzler-Martin grade I (3.1%), 26 grade II (13.5%), 71 grade III (37.0%), 57 grade IV (29.7%), and 32 grade V (16.7%) AVMs. Permanent nondisabling complications occurred in 5 patients (2.6%) and permanent disabling complications or deaths occurred in 3 (1.6%). In addition, there were non-neurologic complications in 4 patients (2.1%) and transient neurologic deficits in 22 (11.5%). Five of the 8 permanent complications (2.6% overall) were ischemic, and 3 of 8 (1.6% overall) were hemorrhagic. Of the 178 patients who were mRS 0-2 pre-embolization, 4 (2.3%) were dependent or dead (mRS >2) at follow-up. Univariate analysis of risk factors for permanent neurologic deficits following embolization showed that basal ganglia location was weakly associated with a new postembolization neurologic deficit.
   CONCLUSION: Embolization of brain AVMs can be performed with a high degree of technical success and a low rate of permanent neurologic complications.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Noninvasive diagnosis of brain lesions is important for the correct choice of treatment. Our aims were to investigate whether 1) proton MR spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI) can aid in differentiating between tumors and nonneoplastic brain lesions, and 2) perfusion MR imaging can improve the classification.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined 69 adults with untreated primary brain lesions (brain tumors, n = 36; benign lesions, n = 10; stroke, n = 4; demyelination, n = 10; and stable lesions not confirmed on pathologic examination, n = 9). MR imaging and 1H-MRSI were performed at 1.5T before biopsy or treatment. Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and choline (Cho) in the lesion were expressed as metabolite ratios and were normalized to the contralateral hemisphere. Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging was performed in a subset of patients (n = 32); relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was evaluated. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify variables that can predict inclusion in the neoplastic or nonneoplastic lesion groups. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the discriminatory capability of H-1-MRSI and perfusion MR imaging.
   RESULTS: The discriminant function analysis correctly classified 84.2% of original grouped cases (P <.0001), on the basis of NAA/Cho, Cho(norm.) NAA(norm,) and NAA/Cr ratios. MRSI and perfusion MR imaging had similar discriminatory capabilities in differentiating tumors from nonneoplastic lesions. With cutoff points of NAA/Cho <= 0.61 and rCBV >= 1.50 (corresponding to diagnosis of the tumors), a sensitivity of 72.2% and specificity of 91.7% in differentiating tumors from nonneoplastic lesions were achieved.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest a promising role for H-1-MRSI and perfusion MR imaging in the distinction between brain tumors and nonneoplastic lesions in adults.

DT Article
ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; ARTERY DISSECTIONS; OCCLUSION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report our experience with endovascular treatment of 14 patients with symptomatic intradural vertebral dissecting aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2000 and January 2006, 14 patients with symptomatic intradural dissecting vertebral aneurysms were treated. A total of 756 (568 ruptured, 188 unruptured) endovascular treated aneurysms (incidence, 1.9%) were treated during this period. There were 7 female and 7 male patients with a mean age of 48 years (age range, 10-64 years). Thirteen patients (93%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and 1 (7%) presented with acute symptoms of mass effect on the brain stem.
   RESULTS: Treatment consisted of coil occlusion of the dissected arterial segment including the aneurysm (internal coil trapping) in 13 of 14 patients and stent placement over the aneurysm as the only therapy in 1 patient. All aneurysms and occluded arterial segments remained occluded on follow-up imaging at 6 to 13 months, and none of the patients had infarctions in the medulla or territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Clinical outcome was excellent in 11 patients; 3 had cognitive impairment after SAH but were independent in daily activities. There were no episodes of recurrent hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSION: Intradural vertebral dissecting aneurysms presenting with SAH should be treated promptly because of the high risk of recurrent hemorrhage. In our experience, trapping of the dissected segment with coils was straightforward, could be done in most patients, and was effective in preventing rebleeding. In our opinion, only in exceptional circumstances are more sophisticated techniques aimed at preservation of the parent artery necessary.

TI Diffusion tensor Imaging in patients with essential tremor
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CEREBELLUM
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The traditional paradigm has regarded essential tremor (ET) as a benign disorder. However, recent clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathologic studies suggest that ET may be a progressive neurologic disorder. Based on clinicopathologic findings that cerebellum and its outflow are the key structures in ET and degeneration of gray matter in cerebellum is followed by consequent wallerian degeneration of white matter (WM) fibers, the aim of the present study was to investigate changes in anisotropy in patients with ET.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fractional anisotropy (FA) images were generated from DTI data acquired at 1.5T in 10 patients with ET compared with 8 control subjects by using statistical parametric mapping to make voxel-by-voxel comparisons.
   RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects, the patients with ET exhibited significantly reduced FA (P-uncorrected <.005) in the anterolateral portion of the right pons and decreased FA in the bilateral cerebellum, left retrorubral area of the midbrain, and bilateral deep WM, including the orbitofrontal, lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal WM.
   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that structural changes in the WM are extensive in patients with ET, supporting the findings of previous functional neuroimaging and pathologic studies.

TI Susceptibility-weighted Imaging for the evaluation of patients with
   familial cerebral cavernous malformations: A comparison with T2-weighted
   fast spin-echo and gradient-echo sequences
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-HISTORY; MUTATIONS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The T2-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) imaging is currently the gold standard MR imaging sequence for the evaluation of patients with cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) lesions. We aimed to compare the sensitivity of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) with T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) and GRE imaging in assigning the number of CCM lesions in patients with the familial form of the disease.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 15 patients (8 men, 7 women; mean age, 34 years) with familial CCM. All patients underwent MR imaging with the following sequences: T1-weighted spin echo, T2-weighted FSE, T2-weighted GRE, and SWI. Two neuroradiologists read the images regarding the number of lesions seen on each sequence. The final decisions were reached by consensus. The number of lesions on the different sequences was compared with analysis of variance, followed by a nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test.
   RESULTS: The number of lesions was higher on T2-weighted GBE than on T2-weighted FSE (P =.001). In addition, more lesions were seen on SWI than on T2-weighted GRE (P =.001) and FSE (P= .001)sequences.
   CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of SWI in assigning the number of CCM lesions in patients with the familial form of the disease is significantly higher than that of T2-weighted FSE and GRE sequences.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

ID PARENTERAL-NUTRITION; THIAMINE-DEFICIENCY; HYPEREMESIS; DIAGNOSIS;
   PATIENT; LESIONS; SURGERY; NUCLEI
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nonalcoholic Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is prone to be underestimated in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to improve its awareness and early accurate diagnosis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the cases of 12 patients with nonalcoholic WE, consisting of clinical characteristics and MR imaging features as well as follow-up after administration of thiamine.
   RESULTS: Patients with mild coma or lethargy (7/12) exhibited typical MR features of symmetric brain paraventricular damage. Patients without disturbances of consciousness or who only had drowsiness (3/12) exhibited a lesion of the periaqueductal area only. In addition to typical MR manifestations, symmetric cortical involvement was observed in 2 of 12 patients with deep coma. Gadolinum enhancement of the mammillary bodies was observed in 2 of 3 patients. No atrophy of the mammillary bodies and cerebellar vermis was found in any patients. Of 10 patients without deep coma and cortical damage, 2 missed the follow-up and 8, who recovered clinically, also showed accordant resolution of abnormal hyperintense signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images within 2 weeks to 1 year after thiamine supplementation. Two patients with deep coma and cortical damage showed a poor prognosis:1 patient died 15 days after being diagnosed with WE, and the other entered a persistent vegetative state during a follow-up of 2 years.
   CONCLUSION: Typical symmetric damage of the mammillary bodies and brain paraventricular regions may permit a specific diagnosis of nonalcoholic WE. In all patients, no atrophy of the mammillary bodies and cerebellar vermis was found. Cortical involvement in patients with nonalcoholic WE may be indicative of irreversible lesions and a poor prognosis.

TI The pathophysiology of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus:
   Cerebral ischemia or altered venous hemodynamics?
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID HYDRODYNAMICS; BLOOD-FLOW; IN-VITRO; VOLUME;
   DYNAMICS; VELOCITY; OUTFLOW; CSF
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many theories of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) stress the importance of ischemia in the deep white matter. Alternate theories stress a reduction in superficial venous compliance and changes in pulse-wave propagation. An overlap in the cerebral blood flow volumes measured between NPH and controls suggests that ischemia may not be a prerequisite for this condition. This study sought to compare blood flow and compliance measures in a cohort of patients with NPH selected for having arterial inflows above the normal range to see if deep brain ischemia or superficial hemodynamic changes contribute to the pathophysiology of NPH.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with NPH and arterial inflows above the normal range were selected. They underwent MR imaging with flow quantification measuring the total blood inflow, sagittal/straight sinus outflow, aqueduct stroke volume, and arteriovenous delay (AVD). Patients were compared with 12 age-matched controls.
   RESULTS: The deep outflow volumes were normal. The superficial venous outflow was reduced as a percentage of the inflow by 9% (P =.04). The sagittal sinus compliance as measured by the AVD was reduced by 50% (P =.0001), and the aqueduct stroke volume was elevated by 192% (P =.02).
   CONCLUSION: Ischemia in the deep venous territory is not a prerequisite for NPH. Patients with high-inflow NPH show alterations in superficial venous compliance and a reduction in the blood flow returning via the sagittal sinus. These changes together suggest that an elevation in superficial venous pressure may occur in NPH.

AB BACKGROUND
   The outcome of vertebrobasilar ischemia depends on the clinical presentation and the presence or absence of vascular occlusion. The aim of our study was to analyze the CT angiography (CTA) predictors of outcome in patients with suspected vertebrobasilar ischemia.
   METHODS
   We studied patients with suspected acute vertebrobasilar ischemia between April 2002 and January 2006 and had CTA done within 24 hours of symptom onset. We reviewed the final diagnosis and 3-month follow-up and analyzed the clinical and CTA predictors of outcome.
   RESULTS
   Of the 133 patients, 21(15%), 18 (13%), and 16 (12%) had occlusion of basilar artery (BA), vertebral artery (VA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) respectively. The final diagnosis was stroke in 98 (73.6%), transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 10 (7.5%), and nonischemic in 25 (18.8%). No vascular occlusion was seen on CTA in patients with TIA and nonischemic diagnosis. At 3-month follow-up, we found a mortality rate of 10.6% and good functional outcome in 71.4%. The predictors of death in the multivariable analysis were the presence of BA occlusion (odds ratio[OR] 6.7, 95% CI, 1.4-30.6) and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (OR 1.14, 95% CI, 1.06-1.2). When patients with basilar occlusion were excluded, the presence of VA occlusion (OR 6.5, 95% CI, 1.34-31.4), age (OR 1.09, 95% CI, 1.03-1.14), and baseline NIHSS (OR 1.1, 95% CI, 1.03-1.18) predicted poorer outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The presence or absence of a vascular occlusion is a critical factor for prognosis in suspected acute vertebrobasilar ischemia and is correlated with the location of occlusion.

DT Article
DE small deep infarcts; lacune; clinical vs MRI diagnosis
ID STROKE SUBTYPE DIAGNOSIS; ATAXIC HEMIPARESIS; DIFFUSION; HYPOTHESIS;
   ACCURACY; VALIDITY
AB BACKGROUND
   The diagnosis of small deep infarcts (SDIs) based on clinical and noncontrast CT findings is often employed to triage stroke patients for emergent endovascular interventions. Few studies have evaluated the accuracy of < 6 hours presentation with lacunar clinical syndromes in predicting the presence of a SDI and the absence of large vessel occlusion.
   METHODS
   Consecutive patients were identified with symptoms suggestive of acute stroke, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and CT performed within 6 hours of onset, and absence of hemorrhage on imaging. Patients were given a diagnosis of SDI if they met the defined clinical and CT criteria. Diagnoses of large vessel occlusion absent (LVOA) and final diagnoses of SDI versus non-SDI incorporated hyperacute multimodal MRI data.
   RESULTS
   Of 64 patients, 15 were diagnosed as SDI at < 6 hours based on clinical/CT criteria. Fourteen of 15 patients (93%) had a final diagnosis of LVOA. Ten of 15 (67%) had a final MR-DWI-confirmed diagnosis of SDI. Clinical/CT diagnosis of SDI showed sensitivity of 44%, specificity 97%, positive predictive value (PPV) 93%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 61% in predicting LVOA and sensitivity 83%, specificity 90%, PPV 67%, and NPV 96% compared to the final diagnosis of SDI. Most patients incorrectly diagnosed with SDIs harbored small cortical branch infarcts.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Diagnoses of SDI < 6 hours from symptom onset based on a classic lacunar syndrome and CT criteria show only modest predictive value in predicting the presence of a small-vessel territory infarct but perform fairly well in identifying patients without large-vessel occlusions amenable to endovascular therapy.

AB Introduction An automated procedure for the detection, quantification, localization and statistical mapping of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images is presented and validated based on the results of a between-centre reproducibility study.
   Methods The first step is the identification of white matter (WM) tissue using a multispectral (T1, T2, PD) segmentation. In a second step, WMH are identified within the WM tissue by segmenting T2 images, isolating two different classes of WMH voxels-low- and high-contrast WMH voxels, respectively. The reliability of the whole procedure was assessed by applying it to the analysis of two large MR imaging databases (n = 650 and n = 710, respectively) of healthy elderly subjects matched for demographic characteristics.
   Results Average overall WMH load and spatial distribution were found to be similar in the two samples, (1.81 and 1.79% of the WM volume, respectively). White matter hyperintensity load was found to be significantly associated with both age and high blood pressure, with similar effects in both samples. With specific reference to the 650 subject cohort, we also found that WMH load provided by this automated procedure was significantly associated with visual grading of the severity of WMH, as assessed by a trained neurologist.
   Conclusion The results show that this method is sensitive, well correlated with semi-quantitative visual rating and highly reproducible.

AB Introduction We report an in vitro study comparing the effectiveness of clot removal and clot fragmentation of five embolectomy systems.
   Methods A flow model was embolized with fresh and old thrombi, occluding an inner diameter of 2-5 mm simulating internal carotid artery (ICA), basilar artery (BA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) branch occlusion. Embolectomy was performed using five retrieval systems: CATCH (Balt), Merci retriever (Concentric), InTime and Attracter (Boston Scientific), and the Phenox Clot Retriever (Phenox). Clot removal and evidence and type of thrombus fragmentation and distal embolization were recorded.
   Results There were no observable differences attributable to thrombus age. The Merci, CATCH and Phenox Clot Retriever were equally able to mobilize and remove thrombi with the exception of one particularly firm clot. There were marked differences in terms of thrombus fragmentation and distal embolization. All devices produced micro- and macrofragments during penetration and retrieval. The Phenox Clot Retriever was able to filter fragments. The InTime and Attracter devices failed to retrieve thrombi in this model and achieved partial removal at best with a tendency towards thrombus displacement and fragmentation.
   Conclusion Within limits, the experimental setup was appropriate for generating occlusions of diameter 2-5 mm of various lengths, simulating ICA, BA and MCA thromboembolism. In this model, thrombus mobilization appeared to be less dependent upon the individual design of the retrieval system than on thrombus fragmentation. The ability to prevent distal embolization is, however, strongly dependent on the ability of a thrombectomy device to capture fragments that are generated during removal of the device.

AB Introduction To report a retrospective series of 84 cerebral developmental venous anomalies (DVAs), focusing on associated parenchymal abnormalities within the drainage territory of the DVA.
   Methods DVAs were identified during routine diagnostic radiological work-up based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (60 cases), computed tomography (CT) (62 cases) or both (36 cases). Regional parenchymal modifications within the drainage territory of the DVA, such as cortical or subcortical atrophy, white matter density or signal alterations, dystrophic calcifications, presence of haemorrhage or a cavernous-like vascular malformation (CVM), were noted. A stenosis of the collecting vein of the DVA was also sought for.
   Results Brain abnormalities within the drainage territory of a DVA were encountered in 65.4% of the cases. Locoregional brain atrophy occurred in 29.7% of the cases, followed by white matter lesions in 28.3% of MRI investigations and 19.3% of CT investigations, CVMs in 13.3% of MRI investigations and dystrophic calcification in 9.6% of CT investigations. An intracranial haemorrhage possibly related to a DVA occurred in 2.4% cases, and a stenosis on the collecting vein was documented in 13.1% of cases. Parenchymal abnormalities were identified for all DVA sizes.
   Conclusion Brain parenchymal abnormalities were associated with DVAs in close to two thirds of the cases evaluated. These abnormalities are thought to occur secondarily, likely during post-natal life, as a result of chronic venous hypertension. Outflow obstruction, progressive thickening of the walls of the DVA and their morphological organization into a venous convergence zone are thought to contribute to the development of venous hypertension in DVA.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to evaluate angiographic CT (ACT) in the combined application of a self-expanding neurovascular stent and detachable platinum coils in the management of broad-based and fusiform intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients harboring wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated with a flexible self-expanding neurovascular stent and subsequent aneurysm embolization with platinum microcoils. ACT was performed after the interventional procedure to analyze stent position and the relationship of coils to the stent. Postprocessing included multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) and maximum intensity projections (MIPs), ACT volume datasets were postprocessed for soft tissue visualization.
   RESULTS: Accurate stent placement with subsequent coil occlusion of the aneurysms was feasible in all of the patients. Similar to nonsubtracted digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images, radiopaque platinum stent markers showed excellent visibility in ACT as well. The stent struts themselves, hardly visible in nonsubtracted DSA, were visible in VIPRs and MIPs of ACT in all of the patients. In aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter, accurate stent assessment at the level of the coils was limited due to beam hardening artifacts. Postprocedural ACT in all of the patients did not reveal any evidence of procedure-related intracranial hemorrhage,
   CONCLUSION: ACT provides cross-sectional, 3D visualization of endovascular stents otherwise hardly visible with plain fluoroscopy. ACT enables us to accurately determine stent position, which may be helpful in complex stent-assisted aneurysm coiling procedures. However, in aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter, beam hardening artifacts caused by the endoaneurysmal coil package impair visibility of the stent. Further data are necessary to evaluate the usefulness of ACT in stent-assisted aneurysm coiling.

ID CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENCE; ANISOTROPY;
   RECOVERY; OUTCOMES; LESIONS; AGE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can noninvasively quantify white matter (WM) integrity. Although its application in adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common, few studies in children have been reported. The purposes of this study were to examine the alteration of fractional anisotropy (FA) in children with TBI experienced during early childhood and to quantify the association between FA and injury severity.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: FA was assessed in 9 children with TBI (age = 7.89 +/- 1.00 years; Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] = 10.11 +/- 4.68) and a control group of 12 children with orthopedic injuries without central nervous system involvement (age = 7.51 +/- 0.95 years). All of the subjects were at minimum 12 months after injury. We examined group differences in a series of predetermined WM regions of interest with t test analysis. We subsequently conducted a voxel-wise comparison with Spearman partial correlation analysis. Correlations between FA and injury severity were also calculated on a voxel-wise basis.
   RESULTS: FA values were significantly reduced in the TBI group in genu of corpus callosum (CC), posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFO), and centrum semiovale (CS). GCS scores were positively correlated with FA in several WM areas including CC, PLIC, SLF, CS, SFO, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO).
   CONCLUSION: This DTI study provides evidence that WM integrity remains abnormal in children with moderate-to-severe TBI experienced during early childhood and that injury severity correlated strongly with FA.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuropathologic findings and preliminary imaging studies demonstrated the absence of pyramidal tract and superior cerebellar peduncular decussation in individual patients with Joubert syndrome (JS). We hypothesized that functional-structural neuroimaging findings do not differ between the genetic forms of JS.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging was performed with a 3T MR imaging-unit. Multiplanar T2-and TI-weighted imaging was followed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Isotropic diffusion-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and color-coded fractional anisotropy maps, including tractography, were subsequently calculated.
   RESULTS: In all 6 patients studied, DTI showed that the fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncles did not decussate in the mesencephalon and the corticospinal tract failed to cross in the caudal medulla. The patients represented various genetic forms of JS.
   CONCLUSION: In JS, the fibers of the pyramidal tract and the superior cerebellar peduncles do not cross, irrespective of the underlying mutation.

   MULTISLICE CT; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; RISK; DSA
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to assess intertechnique and interobserver reproducibility of 64-row multisection CT angiography (CTA) used to detect and evaluate intracranial aneurysms.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 2005 to November 2006, 54 consecutive patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) underwent both CTA and digital substraction angiography (DSA). Four radiologists independently reviewed CT images, and 2 other radiologists reviewed DSA images. Aneurysm diameter (D), neck width (N), and the presence of a branch arising from the sac were assessed.
   RESULTS: DSA revealed 67 aneurysms in 48 patients and no aneurysm in 6 patients. Mean sensitivity and specificity of CTA for the detection of intracranial aneurysms were, respectively, 94% and 90.2%. For aneurysms less than 3 mm, CTA had a mean sensitivity of 70.4%. Intertechnique and interobserver agreements were good for the detection of aneurysms (mean kappa = 0.673 and 0.732, respectively) and for the measurement of their necks (mean kappa = 0.753 and 0.779, respectively). Intertechnique and interobserver agreements were excellent for the measurement of aneurysm diameters (mean K = 0.847 and 0.876, respectively). In addition, CTA was accurate in determining the N/D ratio of aneurysms and adjacent arterial branches. However, the N/D ratio was overestimated by all of the readers at CTA.
   CONCLUSION: Sixty-four-row multisection CTA is an imaging method with a good interobserver reproducibility and a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection and the morphologic evaluation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. It may be used as an alternative to DSA as a first-intention imaging technique in patients with SAH.

The purpose of our study was to demonstrate the usefulness of various perfusion CT (PCT) parameters in assessing the grade of treatment-naive gliomas and also to compare it with conventional MR imaging features.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCT was performed in 19 patients with glioma (14 high-grade gliomas and 5 low-grade gliomas). Normalized ratios of the PCT parameters (normalized cerebral blood volume [nCBV], normalized cerebral blood flow [nCBF], normalized mean transit time [nMTT]) were used for final analysis. Conventional MR imaging features of these tumors were assessed separately and compared with PCT parameters. Low- and high-grade gliomas were compared by using the nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample tests.
   RESULTS: Mean nCBV in the high- and low-grade gliomas was 3.06 +/- 1.35 and 1.44 +/- 0.42, respectively, with a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P =.005). Mean nCBF for the high- and low-grade gliomas was 3.03 +/- 2.16 and 1.16 +/- 0.36, respectively, with a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P =.045). Cut points of > 1.92 for nCBV (85.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity), > 1.48 for nCBF (71.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity), and < 1.94 for nMTT (92.9% sensitivity and 40% specificity) were found to identify the high-grade gliomas. nCBV was the single best parameter; however, using either nCBV of > 1.92 or nCBF of > 1.48 improved the sensitivity and specificity to 92.9% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing a high-grade glioma with conventional MR imaging were 85.7% and 60%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: PCT can be used for preoperative grading of gliomas and can provide valuable complementary information about tumor hemodynamics, not available with conventional imaging techniques. nCBV was the single best parameter correlating with glioma grades, though using nCBF when nCBV was < 1.92 improved the sensitivity. An nCBV threshold of > 1.92 was found to identify the high-grade gliomas.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging features of metronidazole-incluced encephalopathy (MIE) have not been fully established. This study was undertaken to determine the topographic distributions and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings of MIE.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the initial MR images (n = 7), including DWI (n=5), and follow-up MR images (n = 4) after drug discontinuation in 7 patents with clinically diagnosed MIE. The topographic distributions of lesions were evaluated on MR images, and DWI signal intensities and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the lesions were assessed.
   RESULTS: MR images demonstrated bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintense lesions in the cerebellar dentate nucleus (n = 7), midbrain n = 7), dorsal pons (n = 6), medulla (n = 4), corpus callosurn (n = 4), and cerebral white matter (n = 1). Brain stem lesions involved the following: tectum (n = 5), tegmentum (n = 4), red nucleus (n = 3) of the midbrain, vestibular nucleus (n = 6), and a focal tegmental lesion involving the superior olivary nucleus (n = 6) and abducens nucleus (n = 4) of the pons and vestibular nucleus (n = 4) and inferior olivary nucleus (n = 1) of the medulla. DWI (n = 5) showed isointensity or hyperintensity of lesions, and the decreased ADC value was found only in the corpus callosum lesions (n = 2). All detected lesions were completely reversible at follow-up except for the single corpus callosum lesion with an initial low ADC value.
   CONCLUSION: Brain lesions were typically located at the cerebellar dentate nucleus, midbrain, dorsal pons, medulla, and splenium of the corpus callosum. According to DWI, most of the lesions in MIE probably corresponded to areas of vasogenic edema, whereas only some of them, located in the corpus callosum, corresponded to cytotoxic edema.

DT Article

   BIOPSY; SONOGRAPHY; DISEASE
AB Background and purpose: Clinical indications of giant cell arteritis may be unspecific, and noninvasive diagnosis is often difficult. This study investigated the hypothesis that high-resolution MR imaging of the superficial cranial arteries is a noninvasive imaging technique that can detect the occurrence of giant cell arteritis.
   Materials and Methods: Contrast-enhanced, high-resolution MR imaging was performed on 64 consecutive patients with suspected giant cell arteritis, Mural thickness, lumen diameter, and a mural contrast enhancement score were assessed with T1-weighted spin-echo images with submillimeter in-plane spatial resolution. The final rheumatologist's diagnosis according to the clinical criteria of the American College of Rheumatology including laboratory tests and results of temporal artery biopsies from 32 patients was used as a "gold standard" for the evaluation of the MR imaging findings.
   Results: All of the examinations provided diagnostic image quality. Evaluation of the mural inflammatory MR imaging signs for diagnosing vasculitis resulted in a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 97.0%. In comparison, histology results alone showed a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 100%. The mean wall thickness increased significantly from 0.39 mm (+/- 0.18 mm) to 0.74 mm (+/- 0.32 mm; P < .001), and the lumen diameter decreased significantly from 0.84 mm (+/- 0.29 mm) to 0.65 mm (+/- 0.38 mm; P < .05) for patients with giant cell arteritis.
   Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced, high-resolution MR imaging allows noninvasive assessment of mural inflammation in giant cell arteritis with good diagnostic certainty. Measures of mural thickening and contrast enhancement can be obtained in these small vessels and provide valuable vasculitic MR imaging findings.

AB Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) provide useful data for tumor evaluation. To assess the contribution of these multimodal techniques in grading glial neoplasms, we compared the value of DWI, PWI and MRS in the evaluation of histologically proven high- and low-grade gliomas in a population of 105 patients.
   Independently for each modality, the following variables were used to compare the tumors: minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) normalized values between tumor and healthy tissue, maximum Cho/Cr ratio and minimum NAA/Cr ratio in tumor, and scored lactate and lipid values in tumor. The Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were employed to compare DWI, PWI and MRS between tumor types. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which parameters best increased the diagnostic accuracy in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. ROC curves were determined for parameters with high sensitivity and specificity to identify threshold values to separate high- from low-grade lesions.
   Statistically significant differences were found for rCBV tumor/normal tissue ratio, and NAA/Cr ratio in tumor and Cho/Cr ratio in tumor between low- and high-grade tumors. The best performing single parameter for group classification was the normalized rCBV value; including all parameters, statistical significance was reached by rCBV tumor/normal tissue ratio, NAA/Cr tumor ratio and lactate. From the ROC curves, a high probability for a neoplasm to be a high-grade lesion was associated with a rCBV tumor/normal tissue ratio of > 1.16 and NAA/Cr tumor ratio of < 0.44.
   Combining PWI and MRS with conventional MR imaging increases the accuracy of the attribution of malignancy to glial neoplasms. The best performing parameter was found to be the perfusion level.

ID MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; ARTERY OCCLUSION; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; CINE;
   QUANTIFICATION; AGE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to derive regional cerebral blood flow using vessel flows from quantitative MR angiography (qMRA).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Flow rates in the 15 major cerebral arteries were measured on retrospectively gated fast 2D phase-contrast MR angiography obtained in 83 healthy adult volunteers (age range, 24-74 years; mean, 42 years). The arterial network of the brain was partitioned into 12 different regions, in which flows were calculated from the measured flows of the 15 cerebral arteries.
   RESULTS: The mean flows of the 15 arteries and the 12 regions were calculated. The mean total cranial flow and the mean total cerebral blood flow were 949 +/- 158 mL/min and 695 +/- 113 ML/min, respectively. The mean regional flows for the anterior and posterior circulation were 483 +/- 87 mL/min and 212 +/- 34 mL/min, respectively. The relative contributions of the flows in the 11 regions to their parent regions were obtained. The mean flows in the individual arteries and the regions with age were also calculated. The mean flows for the female group were significantly lower than those for the male group (P <.001) for the 2 common carotids and the cranial circulation and left/right extracranial circulation. However, the intracranial circulation was not different between sexes.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 12 regions in the cerebral circulation were identified and formed into a partition tree, and the mean regional flow for each region was determined using vessel flows from qMRA.

   DISSECTION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to improve our understanding of the subinsular white matter microstructural asymmetries in healthy right-handed subjects. Structural brain asymmetries could be related to functional asymmetries such as hemisphere language dominance or handedness. Besides the known gray matter asymmetries, white matter asymmetries could also play a key role in the understanding of hemispheric specialization, notably that of language,
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: White matter asymmetries were studied by diffusion tensor imaging at 1.5T (41 diffusion-gradient directions; b-value set to 700 S/mm(2); matrix, 1282; in-plane resolution, 1.875 X 1.875 mm; section thickness, 2.0 mm) and fiber tracking (BrainVISA software). The main white matter bundles passing through the subinsular area were segmented, and fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured along each of the segmented bundles.
   RESULTS: In line with published results, we found an asymmetry of the arcuate fasciculus and the subinsular white matter, namely eft-greater-than-right FA in right-handed controls. Furthermore, by segmenting major tracts coursing through this region, we showed that the subinsular portions of the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus (IOF) contribute to this FA asymmetry. Those tracts have been reported to be likely implicated in the language network.
   CONCLUSION: Because the left hemisphere hosts language functions in most right-handers, the significant leftward asymmetry observed within the arcuate fasciculus, the subinsular part of the UF and IOF may be related to the hemispheric specialization for language.

ID RUPTURED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; DETACHABLE COILS; EMBOLIZATION;
   OCCLUSION; SURGERY; MULTICENTER; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the results of endovascular treatment (EVT) of middle cerebral artery aneurysms (MCAAs) in a center where embolization is the first treatment option considered.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-two MCAAs were diagnosed in 87 patients between September 2001 and January 2006. The strategy of treatment (endovascular versus surgical), the clinical and angiographic results of embolization, and the ensuing complications are described.
   RESULTS: Initially, 59 aneurysms (64.1%) in 55 patients were embolized, 18 (19.6%) were clipped, and 15 (16.3%) were not treated. Four endovascular procedures failed (7.3%), and 55 aneurysms in 51 patients were finally treated by embolization. During the procedure, complications occurred in 13 patients (25.5%) comprising 3 ruptures and 10 thromboembolisms. In the follow-up, 4 patients having a preoperative complication had a modified Rankin scale more than 2 (3 patients [5.9%]) or died (11 patient [2.0%]). Of the 55 embolized aneurysms, according to the Raymond scale, 23 (41.8%) were completely occluded, 24 (43.6%) retained a residual neck, and 8 (14.6%) were residual at the end of the first procedure. No bleeding was detected during the follow-up period in the embolized patients.
   CONCLUSION: EVT of MCAA is effective for preventing rebleeding episodes within the first year of treatment judging by historical controls. The real question is whether clipping or coiling of MCAAs is better in terms of reducing rebleeding rates and complications rates in the long term, and such a determination would require a far larger number of patients over a much longer observation period.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The management of intracranial pseudoaneurysms is controversial. The purpose of this study was to provide a preliminary evaluation of the clinical efficacy of a Willis covered stent specially designed for the intracranial vasculature in the management of a pseudoaneurysm of the cranial internal carotid artery (CICA).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients with pseudoaneurysms of the CICA were treated with use of the Willis covered stent. The flexibility of the entire stent system was gauged from the resistance met when reaching the target lesion and was categorized as no resistance, no apparent resistance, or resistance that could be overcome. The apposition of the Willis stent after deployment was scored as excellent with no endoleak, good with a small endoleak, or bad with an apparent endoleak. Follow-up angiography was performed 3 to 12 months after placement of the stent, and angiographic assessments were categorized as endoleak, stenosis of the covered segment of vessel, or occlusion of parent arteries. Follow-up clinical evaluations were also performed, and outcomes were graded as full recovery, improvement, unchanged, and aggravation.
   RESULTS: Endovascular treatment was technically successful in all aneurysms without procedural-related complications, and all of the stents were easily navigated to the targeted lesions in the CICA. Complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm was observed in 6 patients immediately after the procedure, and a minimal endoleak into the aneurysm persisted in 2 patients. No morbidity or mortality and no technical adverse event occurred. A follow-up angiogram confirmed complete reconstruction of the internal carotid artery, with no recurrent aneurysmal filling and no occurrence of stenosis in the area of the stent. By the final follow-up visit, 4 patients had fully recovered, 3 had improved, and 1 patient's condition was unchanged.
   CONCLUSION: On the basis of our preliminary experience, the Willis covered stent specially designed for the intracranial vasculature can manage a CICA pseudoaneurysm safely and effectively, but longer follow-up and expanded clinical trials are needed.

   RISK; PERFORMANCE
AB Background and Purpose. Intimal-medial thickening (IMT) of the carotid wall is an accepted peripheral marker of atherosclerosis. It is associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction and stroke, and lower attention-executive-psychomotor functioning. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between IMT and brain activity during a verbal working memory (VWM) task in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods. Thirteen CVD patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a 2-Back VWM task, and B-mode ultrasound of the carotid arteries. IMT was calculated using an automated algorithm based on a validated edge-detection technique. The relationship between IMT and 2-Back-related brain activity was modeled using partial correlations controlling for age and small vessel disease as measured by white matter signal hyperintensities on MRI (WMH). Results. Higher IMT was associated with lower 2-Back-related signal intensity and in the right middle frontal gyrus, independent of age and WMH. Conclusions. IMT may be one mechanism contributing to brain dysfunction in CVD. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast appears to be highly sensitive to peripheral vascular health as measured by IMT. Future studies should examine the sensitivity and specificity of the BOLD response for predicting cognitive decline in CVD.

TI CT and ultrasound in the study of ulcerated carotid plaque compared with

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ulceration is a severe complication of carotid plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and the diagnostic efficacy of multidetector row CT angiography (MDCTA) and ultrasound (US) echo color Doppler (US-ECD) in the study of patients with carotid plaque complicated by ulceration through the comparison with the surgical observation.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to October 2005, 237 patients, for a total of 474 carotid arteries, studied at first with color Doppler US, were analyzed using CT angiography. A total of 103 patients underwent a carotid endarterectomy. We analyzed stenosis degree, plaque composition, and presence of ulcerations. In a second phase, the data were compared with the surgical results when the MDCTA indicated surgical intervention.
   RESULTS: MDCTA found 31 ulcerations; the surgical confirmation underlined a 93.75% sensitivity and a 98.59% specificity. US-ECD performances were 37.5% and 91.5% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The number of patients who showed plaque ulcerations increased with the severity of stenosis. Furthermore, ulcerations of the carotid plaque occurred more often proximal than distal to the point of maximum stenosis, and this trend increased with the severity of the stenosis. We also determined that fatty plaques were more likely to be affected by ulcerations.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that MDCTA detects with higher sensitivity and specificity the presence of ulcerated plaque compared with US-ECD, which has been demonstrated to be less effective in this evaluation. Considering the high MDCTA sensitivity and specificity for detection of plaque ulceration, we therefore recommend MDCTA as a useful step for correct presurgical planning.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and single brain metastasis (MET) are the 2 most common malignant brain tumors that can appear similar on anatomic imaging but require vastly different treatment strategy. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the peak height and the percentage of signal intensity recovery derived from dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced QSQ perfusion MR imaging could differentiate GBM and MET.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with histopathologic diagnosis of GBM (n = 27) or MET In = 16) underwent DSC perfusion MR imaging in addition to anatomic MR imaging before surgery. Regions of interest were drawn around the nonenhancing periturnoral T2 lesion (PTL) and the contrast-enhancing lesion (CEL). T2* signal intensity-time curves acquired during the first pass of gadolinium contrast material were converted to the changes in relaxation rate to yield T2* relaxivity (Delta R2*) curve. The peak height of maximal signal intensity drop and the percentage of signal intensity recovery at the end of first pass were measured for each voxel in the PTL and CEL regions of the tumor.
   RESULTS: The average peak height for the PTL was significantly higher (P =.04) in GBM than in MET. The average percentage of signal intensity recovery was significantly reduced in PTL (78.4% versus 82.8%; P =.02) and in CEL (62.5% versus 80.9%, P <.01) regions of MET compared with those regions in the GBM group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study show that the peak height and the percentage of signal intensity recovery derived from the Delta R2* curve of DSC perfusion MR imaging can differentiate GBM and MET.

TI Sinus pericranii: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in 15
   patients
SO NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE sinus pericranii; developmental venous anomaly; venous malformation;
   emissary vein
ID VENOUS ANGIOMA
AB Introduction Sinus pericranii (SP) is a rare, usually asymptomatic condition characterized by a large communication between the intra- and the extracranial venous drainage pathways in which blood may circulate bidirectionally through dilated veins of the skull. We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic experience with SP, with a special focus on the vascular analysis of digital subtraction angiography (DSA).
   Methods DSA images of 15 patients were evaluated with regard to the delay in opacification of the scalp vessels, the absence or distortion of the superficial cortical veins in the vicinity of the SP, the drainage patterns of the superior sagittal sinus, and the degree of maturation of the venous outlets of the brain. SP were classified either as "dominant", if the main stream of contrast flow used the SP to drain the brain bypassing usual venous outlets, or as "accessory", if only a small part of the venous outflow occurred through the extradiploic vessels.
   Results All patients presented with a nonpulsatile, soft-tissue mass. The lesion was on the midline in 14 of 15 patients, frontal in 12 patients, and parietal in 2 patients. In 13 patients, associated intracranial venous anomalies were present, eight of which were developmental venous anomalies. Seven patients had a dominant SP, and eight an accessory SP.
   Conclusion SP can be considered the cutaneous sign of an underlying venous anomaly. If treatment is contemplated, analysis of the drainage pattern of the SP has to be performed. Treatment should be avoided in dominant SP or if its accessory role constitutes the only collateral pathway of an underlying venous anomaly.

   VEINS; RISK
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the method of reference for imaging of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). The goal of this study was to analyze the value of different MR images including 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) with a high temporal resolution in diagnostic and follow-up imaging of DAVFs.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 18 MR/MRA examinations from 14 patients with untreated (n = 9) and/or treated (n = 9) DAVFs were evaluated. Two observers assessed all MR and MRA investigations for signs indicating the presence of a DAVF, for fistula characteristics such as fistula grading, location of fistulous point, and fistula obliteration after treatment. All results were compared with DSA findings.
   RESULTS: On time-resolved 3D contrast-enhanced (TR 3D) MRA, the side and presence of all patent fistulas (n = 13) were correctly indicated, and no false-positive findings were observed in occluded DAVFs (n = 5). Grading of fistulas with this imaging technique was correct in 77% and 85% of patent fistulas for both readers, respectively. On T2-weighted images, signs indicative of a DAVF were encountered only in fistulas with cortical venous reflux (56%), whereas on 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA, most fistulas (88%) were correctly detected. In complete fistula occlusion, false-positive findings were encountered on both T2-weighted images and on TOF MRA images.
   CONCLUSION: In this study, TR 3D MRA proved reliable in detecting DAVFs and suitable for follow-up imaging. The technique allowed-within limitations-to grade DAVFs. Although 3D TOF MRA can depict signs of DAVFs, its value for follow-up imaging is limited.

   VEINS; VISUALIZATION; ANATOMY; DISEASE; SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) as a rare but important cause of stroke is challenging. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of multicletector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) as a fast and cost-effective imaging tool in diagnosing CVST.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients who presented with clinical symptoms of a possible CVST were included, All patients had received both MDCTA and MR imaging with venous MR-angiography. Three blinded readers were asked to identify the cerebral sinuses and veins in MDCTA and to evaluate the presence of CVST in MDCTA. Consensus reading with interpretation of the MR imaging served to establish the definite diagnosis.
   RESULTS: The consensus reading revealed CVST in 10 of the 19 patients. With MDCTA, the venous sinuses could be identified in 99.2% and the cerebral veins in 87.6% of cases. The sensitivity and specificity of MDCTA for the diagnosis of CVST were 100%.
   CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that MDCTA provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CVST. Further studies are needed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of MDCTA in specific subsets of the general entity of CVST such as cortical venous thrombosis, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and thrombosis of the internal cerebral veins.

ID COIL EMBOLIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; MALFORMATIONS; REFLUX
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our purpose was to report our experience with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) with cortical venous drainage during a 12-year period.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1994 and January 2006, 91 patients with intracranial DAVFs presented at our institution, and 29 (32%) had cortical venous drainage. There were 5 women and 24 men (mean age, 53.9 years; range, 24-77). Clinical presentation was intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage in 18 patients (62%), seizures in 4 patients (14%), visual symptoms in 2 patients (7%), pulsatile bruit in 1 patient (3%), and the DAVF (14%) was incidentally discovered in 4 patients.
   RESULTS: In 2 patients, the DAVF had been obliterated spontaneously at the time of scheduled embolization 10 and 2 months after hemorrhage, respectively. Five patients with an anterior fossa DAVF underwent successful surgery. In 14 patients, the DAVF was completely occluded with embolization alone, and in 7 patients, embolization was followed by surgery. Altogether, complete occlusion was angiographically confirmed in 28 of 29 DAVFs; the result of radiosurgery of 1 DAVF is pending. There were no complications of surgery; embolization was complicated by postembolization hemorrhage in 1 patient (3%).
   CONCLUSION: Most DAVFs with cortical venous drainage have an aggressive clinical course. Treatment by a neurovascular team by using surgery, embolization, or a combination resulted in cure in all cases, with a very low complication rate.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

ID PSEUDOTUMOR CEREBRI; PRESSURE
AB Elevated intracranial intravenous pressure seems to be of importance in pseudotumor cerebri syndromes, either as a cause (secondary intracranial hypertension) or as a consequence (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) of increased intracranial pressure. We present 3 case reports in which diagnostic imaging before and after CSF diversion provided evidence that narrowing of the transverse sinuses is a secondary phenomenon. Stent angioplasty of the venous sinuses should not be considered a therapeutic approach in these cases.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid plaque ulceration is an important risk factor for stroke, and its diagnosis may be very important to plan a correct therapeutic approach. We hypothesized that axial scans and various reconstruction methods could have different specificity and sensitivity in the study of plaque ulceration. The object of this study was to evaluate their role and diagnostic efficacy in patients with carotid plaque complicated by ulceration through the comparison with surgical results.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to November 2005, 109 patients who underwent a carotid endarterectomy were analyzed using CT angiography for a total of 218 carotid arteries. We assessed every carotid for the presence of ulcerations. For each patient axial image, maximum intensity projection (MIP), multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), shaded surface display (SSD), and volume rendering (VR) reconstructions were obtained.
   RESULTS: Multidetector row CT angiography (MDCT) found 32 ulcerations; surgical confirmation underlined an overall 93.9% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.858-1.021), and a 98.7% specificity (95% CI, 0.961-1.012). Axial scans and volume rendering images demonstrated the highest sensitivity (90.9% and 87.9%, respectively); SSD, on the contrary, showed the lowest sensitivity: 39.4% (95% CI sensitivity, 0.227-0.561).
   CONCLUSION: Axial scans plus VR reconstruction techniques offer superior depiction of carotid plaque ulceration compared with MIP, MPR, and SSD.

   CONVERSION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In Alzheimer disease (AD), a peculiar regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormality has been reported in the posterior cingulate gyri and precunei, even at a very early stage. We performed a multicenter brain perfusion single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) study to evaluate the discrimination ability of an easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS) with a common normal data base between patients with very early AD at the stage of mild cognitive impairment and age-matched healthy controls.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: For a multicenter study, SPECT images of 40 patients with AD and 40 healthy volunteers were acquired from 4 gamma camera systems in 4 different institutions. Systematic differences of SPECT images between gamma cameras were corrected by using conversion maps calculated from the SPECT images of the same brain phantom. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to discriminate patients and controls by using a Z-score in the volume of interest (VOI), which had been defined as a region related to AD in subjects other than those in a multicenter study.
   RESULTS: Bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, precunei, and parietal cortices were defined as a V01 showing rCBF reduction in very early AD. A new indicator of rCBF abnormality in the VOI provided 86% accuracy for distinction of AD and healthy controls in the multicenter study. The area under the ROC curve was 0.934.
   CONCLUSION: Because an eZIS can use a common normal data base by converting site-specific SPECT data to the core data, the eZIS was useful for automated diagnosis of very early AD in routine studies in multiple institutions.

   SENSITIVITY; ADMISSION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the association of multisection CT angiography (MSCTA) and perfusion CT (PCT) for the characterization of vasospasm secondary to aneurysmal su.oarachnoid hemorrhage.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 27 patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular vasospasm investigated by digital subtraction angiography QSA), 18 underwent both cerebral PCT and MSCTA. For the remaining 9, only PCT or MSCTA could be performed. MSCTA was compared with DSA for the detection and characterization of vasospasm on 286 intracranial arterial segments. PCT maps were visually reviewed for mean transit time, relative cerebral blood flow, and relative cerebral blood volume abnormalities and wore qualitatively compared with the corresponding regional vasospasm detected by DSA.
   RESULTS: Vasospasm was grouped into 2 categories: mild-moderate and severe. The depiction of va sospasm by MSCTA showed the best sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy at the level of the A2 and M2 arterial segments (100% for each), in contrast to the carotid siphon (45%, 100%, and 85% respectively). The characterization of vasospasm severity by MSCTA showed a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86.8%, 96.8%, and 95.2%, respectively, for mild-moderate vasospasm, and 76.5%, 99.5%, and 97.5%, respectively, for severe vasospasm. The PCT abnormalities were related to severe vasospasm in 9 patients and to mild-to-mode rate vasospasm in 2. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PCT in detecting vasospasm were 90%, 100%, and 92.3%, respectively, for severe vasospasm, and 20%, 100%, and 38.5%, respectively, for mild-moderate vasospasm.
   CONCLUSION: MSCTA/PCT can assess the location and severity of cerebrovascular vasospasm and its related perfusion abnormalities. It can identify severe vasospasm with risk of delayed ischemia and can thus guide the invasive treatment.

ID INTRAARTERIAL THROMBOLYSIS; CLOT DISRUPTION; THERAPY; RECANALIZATION;
   ANGIOPLASTY; OCCLUSIONS; MANAGEMENT; ARTERIES; SAFETY; TRIAL
AB Background and Purpose: We prospectively evaluated the safety of aggressive mechanical disruption of thrombus following full-dose intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to treat ischemic stroke in 24 patients with an initial National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score of >= 10. Methods: Clinical evaluations were performed at presentation and 24 hours, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months (using modified Rankin scale) after treatment. These end points were compared to matched historical controls treated with IV rt-PA alone. Results: Of the 24 patients, mechanical disruption was undertaken in 17 patients with persistent angiographic occlusion using microcatheter exploration (n = 3), angioplasty (n = 5), snare maneuvers (n = 7), and combination of both (n = 2). Partial or complete recanalization was observed in 10 of the 17 patients. Neurological improvement at 24 hours (>= 4 point reduction in NIHSS score) was observed in 11 of 17 patients. Comparisons with matched controls suggest potential equivalence for symptomatic ICH (0% vs 12%), asymptomatic ICH (18% vs 15%), and early neurological improvement (65% vs 53%). Conclusion: The study shows that aggressive mechanical thrombus disruption in large artery occlusion in the setting of acute ischemic stroke is safe with acceptable rates of ICH and promotes angiographic recanalization.

AB Background and Purpose. This study investigated the association of medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy and cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH], subclinical infarcts) with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) among cognitively normal older adults. Methods. Risk of developing AD was examined for 155 cognitively normal older adults (77.4 years, 60% women, 81% white). The MTL volumes and the presence of WMH and of subclinical infarcts were determined from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the beginning of the study. Follow-up cognitive evaluations (average 4.3 years) identified those who developed AD. Results. The presence of either MTL atrophy or subclinical infarcts was independently and significantly associated with a greater risk to develop AD (OR [95% CI]: 4.4 [1.5, 12.3] and 2.7 [1.0, 7.1], respectively). In addition, those participants with both MTL atrophy and at least one brain infarct had a 7-fold increase in the risk of developing AD (OR [95% CI]: 7.0 [1.5, 33.1]), compared to those who had neither of these conditions. Conclusions. In cognitively normal older adults, markers of neurodegeneration (as reflected by MTL atrophy) and of cerebrovascular disease (as reflected by infarcts on MRI) independently contribute to the risk to develop AD.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The underlying changes in the neuronal connectivity adjacent to brain tumors cannot always be depicted by conventional MR imaging. The hypothesis of this study was that preoperative sensorimotor deficits are associated with impairment in pyramidal fiber bundles. Hence, we investigated the potential of combined quantitative diffusion tensor (DT) fiber tracking and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to determine changes in the pyramidal tract adjacent to gliomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative DT fiber tracking and proton MRSI were performed in 20 patients with gliomas with WHO grades II-IV. Eight patients experienced preoperative sensorimotor deficits. Mean diffusivity (MID), fractional anisotropy (FA), and number of fibers per voxel (FpV) were calculated for the pyramidal tract of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere. Metabolite concentrations for choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were computed, using LCModel, for all voxels located at the pyramidal tracts.
   RESULTS: For the whole pyramidal tract, quantitative IDT fiber tracking resulted in significantly lower FpV and FA values (P <.001), but not MID values, for the ipsilateral hemisphere. For the section of the fiber bundle closest to the lesion, we found significantly decreased FpV and FA (P <.001) and increased MD (P =.002). MRSI showed, for the same volumes of interest, significantly decreased NAA (P =.001), increased Cho (P =.034) and Cho/NAA (P =.001) for the ipsilateral pyramidal tract. In patients suffering sensorimotor deficits, we found significantly lower FA (P =.022) and higher MD values (P =.026) and a strongly negative correlation between FA and MID (R = -0.710, P =.024) but no correlation in patients without deficits (R = 0.078, ns).
   CONCLUSION: Quantitative DTI was able to show significant differences in diffusivity of the pyramidal tract in patients with sensorimotor deficits in relation to patients without them. The additional use of proton MRSI may be helpful to discern whether these diffusivity changes in fiber tracts are caused by tumor infiltration or peritumoral edema.

TI Use of self-expanding stents in distal small cerebral vessels
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COIL EMBOLIZATION; ANEURYSMS; NEUROFORM
AB BACKGROUND: Previously, endovascular treatment of wide-necked aneurysms and stenosis involving small vessels measuring < 2 mm in diameter was limited. There are no reports in the literature addressing stent placement in small distal cerebral vessels. Recent experience with the Neuroform stent has shown that this device can be safely and effectively used to treat aneurysms in vessels of this caliber.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report 8 cases of Neuroform stent placement into cerebral vessels measuring < 2 mm in diameter (range, 1.1-1.8 mm). All stents were placed for aneurysm treatment in conjunction with coiling. Lesion locations and number were as follows: anterior communicating artery region (n = 5), pericallosal artery A2-A3 (n = 1), middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1-M2 (n 1), and MCA M3-M4 (n = 1). Clinical follow-up ranged from 4.5 to 18 months. Imaging follow-up was performed with MR imaging/MR angiography.
   RESULTS: All procedures were successfully performed without immediate or delayed device-related complications. Intraprocedural thrombus developed within the stent in 2 patients and immediately resolved with 10 mg of intra-arterial abciximab. Follow-up at 18 months demonstrated durable results. There were no clinical neurologic symptoms related to the treated vessel territory at follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: Development of newer low-profile endovascular devices allows access and ability to treat lesions farther out in the smaller cerebral vessels. We have safely and successfully treated 8 vessels smaller than 2 mm in diameter with newer self-expanding stents with good short- and intermediate-term results. Further follow-up and more experience are necessary to determine long-term results.

   ASYMMETRY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent evidence from neuropsychologic and neuroimaging studies suggests that central nervous system involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) extends beyond motor neurons. Our purpose was to obtain measures of global and regional atrophy in nondemented patients with ALS to assess subtle structural brain changes.
   METHODS: MR images, acquired from 16 patients and 9 healthy subjects (HS), were processed by using the Structural Imaging Evaluation of Normalized Atrophy (SIENA) software to estimate wholebrain atrophy measures and the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method to highlight the selective volumetric decrease of single cerebral areas. In addition, each subject underwent a neuropsychologic examination.
   RESULTS: In patients with ALS, brain parenchymal fraction was slightly lower compared with HS (P = .012), and seemed to be related to the presence of cognitive impairment. Patients showed a gray matter volume decrease in several frontal and temporal areas bilaterally (P < .001 uncorrected) compared with HS, with a slight prevalence in the right hemisphere. No volume reduction in primary motor cortices of patients was detected. Performances on Symbol Digit Modalities Test were significantly worse in patients compared with HS (P = .025).
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mild whole-brain volume loss and regional frontotemporal atrophy in patients with ALS could explain the presence of cognitive impairment and confirms the idea of ALS as a degenerative brain disease not confined to motor system.

   ANISOTROPY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies have reported abnormal changes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by histogram and region-of-interest-based methods by using diffusion tenor imaging. However, there are few studies on specific white matter fiber tracts of BBMS. Our study sought to use diffusion tensor tractography-based group mapping to investigate the presence of abnormal diffusion in the normal-appearing pyramidal tract (PYT) of BBMS and its possible mechanism.
   METHODS: A PYT probability map was first constructed from data on 20 healthy patients based on the deterministic-based tractography method. The PYT probability map was then applied to 29 RRMS patients to calculate diffusion indices of the PYT. In this study, 4 quantitative indices-fractional anisotropy (FA), directionally averaged diffusion coefficient (D-av), axial diffusion coefficient (lambda(1)), and radial diffusion coefficient (lambda(23))-were used to characterize the abnormal diffusion.
   RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, RRMS patients had a significantly higher D-av and lambda(23) but a lower FA and a trend toward a lower lambda(1) in the normal-appearing PYT. In RRMS patients, PYT lesions had a significantly higher lambda(23) and a lower FA, but there were no differences for D-av and lambda(1) when compared with the normal-appearing PYT. Moreover, the diffusion indices derived from the normal-appearing PYT were significantly correlated with PYT lesion volumes by using the Spearman correlation analysis.
   CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the presence of abnormal diffusion in the normal-appearing PYT of RRMS patients and suggest that wallerian degeneration might be its mechanism.

TI Imaging degeneration of the substantia nigra in Parkinson disease with
   inversion-recovery MR imaging
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; BRAIN; VARIANT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visualizing with MR imaging and obtaining quantitative indexes of degeneration of the substantia nigra in Parkinson disease have been long-sought goals. We investigated the potential role of area and T1 contrast measurements in differentiating patients from controls and their age-related changes.
   METHODS: Eight patients with Parkinson disease, 8 age-matched controls, and 8 young controls were imaged. We obtained the pixel-wise difference between 2 sets of inversion-recovery images, acquired parallel to the bicommissural plane, with different inversion times. Pixel-intensity ratios between lateral and medial nigral regions, and nigral area and substantia-nigra/midbrain area ratios were computed.
   RESULTS: Compared with that of controls, loss of substantia nigra was evident in patients, its borders taking a smoother and more irregular appearance. Patients were characterized by a lateral-to-medial gradient, due to reduced hypointensity of the lateral portion of the substantia nigra and relative sparing of its medial portion. The visible nigral area was significantly smaller in patients compared with matched controls (P = .04). The substantia nigra/midbrain area ratio enabled considerably better separation (P = .0001). The lateral/medial pixel-intensity ratio was significantly higher in patients compared with matched controls (P = .01) and in young controls compared with age-matched controls (P = .01).
   CONCLUSION: Inversion-recovery sequences may provide a convenient way to visualize nigral degeneration. Relative area and pixel-intensity measurements may integrate other techniques (such as diffusion-tensor imaging on nigrostriatal pathways) in the neuroradiologic diagnosis and follow-up of Parkinson disease by quantitatively assessing the degeneration of the substantia nigra.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Encovascular treatment (EVT) of carotid cavernous fistulas (CCFs) is based on various techniques, mainly those using detachable balloons. Coronary covered stent grafts have been sporadically used in the intracranial arteries and only 2 traumatic CCFs have been reported in the literature; moreover, there is poor information about the long-term follow-up. We present 8 cases of CCFs treated by the placement of a covered stent, 5 of which have a 1-year clinical and angiographic follow-up.
   METHODS: Eight patients with posttraumatic CCF were treated by positioning a covered stent in the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) to occlude the fistula. They received periodic clinical and angiographic follow-up to evaluate the patency and the stability of clinical results.
   RESULTS: In all cases, the symptoms related to the CCF regressed after treatment and did not recur in the follow-up. Two patients presented residual filling of the CCF at the end of the procedure. The angiographic follow-up revealed in 6 patients of 7 a good patency of the ICA; in 1 patient, there was an ICA asymptomatic occlusion. One patient required transvenous coil occlusion of the cavernous sinus.
   CONCLUSION: When standard treatments fail, covered stent grafts can be used as a valid alternative in the treatment of CCFs, but more data are needed, especially in the long-term follow-up.

ID MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CHILDREN; LESIONS; FEATURES
AB Introduction Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is usually a monophasic illness characterized by multiple lesions involving gray and white matter. Quantitative MR techniques were used to characterize and stage these lesions.
   Methods Eight patients ( seven males and one female; mean age 19 years, range 5 to 36 years) were studied using conventional MRI (T2- and T1-weighted and FLAIR sequences), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) values and MRS ratios were calculated for the lesion and for normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Three patients were imaged in the acute stage ( within 7 days of the onset of neurological symptoms) and five in the subacute stage ( after 7 days from the onset of symptoms).
   Results ADC values in NAWM were in the range 0.7-1.24 x 10(-3) mm/s(2) ( mean 0.937 +/- 0.17 mm/s(2)). ADC values of ADEM lesions in the acute stage were in the range 0.37-0.68 x 10(-3) mm/s(2) ( mean 0.56 +/- 0.16 mm/s(2)) and 1.01-1.31 x 10(-3) mm/s(2) ( mean 1.24 +/- 0.13 mm/s(2)) in the subacute stage. MRS ratios were obtained for all patients. NAA/Cho ratios were in the range 1.1 - 3.5 ( mean 1.93 +/- 0.86) in the NAWM. NAA/Cho ratios within ADEM lesions in the acute stage were in the range 0.63 - 1.48 ( mean 1.18 +/- 0.48) and 0.29 - 0.84 ( mean 0.49 +/- 0.22) in the subacute stage. The ADC values, NAA/Cho and Cho/Cr ratios were significantly different between lesions in the acute and subacute stages ( P< 0.001, P< 0.027, P< 0.047, respectively). ADC values were significantly different between lesions in the acute ( P< 0.009) and subacute stages ( P< 0.005) with NAWM. In addition, NAA/Cho and Cho/Cr ratios were significantly different between lesions in the subacute stage and NAWM ( P< 0.006, P< 0.007, respectively).
   Conclusion ADEM lesions were characterized in the acute stage by restricted diffusion and in the subacute stage by free diffusion and a decrease in NAA/Cho ratios. Restricted diffusion and progressive decrease in NAA/Cho ratios may help in staging the disease.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We prospectively evaluated the influence of different imaging techniques (time-of-flight MR angiography [TOF-MRA], contrast-enhanced MR angiography [CE-MRA], multisection CT angiography [CTA]) and postprocessing methods (maximum intensity projection [MIP], multiplanar reformation [MPR]) on carotid artery stenosis grading.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients (34 men, 16 women) with symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery were examined with a 16-section spiral CT and a 1.5T MR unit. Two MRA techniques were applied: 3D-TOF and CE-MRA. MPR was used for postprocessing with all modalities; MIP was used only with MRA. Four readers measured and calculated the percentage diameter stenosis independently according to NASCET criteria. The Wilcoxon test was used to measure interobserver variability, and the Friedman test was used to test the null-hypothesis of equality of the modalities.
   RESULTS: The hypothesis for global equality was rejected (P <.001). TOF-MRA and CTA assessed with MPR showed the highest concordance (difference, 0.6%; confidence interval [CI], -3.0, 4.3%), and CE-MRA with MIP and CTA showed the lowest concordance in stenosis grading (difference, 7.0%; CI, 3.4, 10.6%). MPR resulted in lower degrees of stenosis than MIP for both MRA sequences, although not statistically significant (CE, -3.0%; Cl, -6.6, 0.6%; TOF, -2.2%; Cl, -5.8, 1.4%). When only studies with good or excellent image quality were considered, the differences decreased, but the trends remained.
   CONCLUSION: Stenosis grading is dependent on the examination method and postprocessing technique. CTA and TCF-MRA evaluated with MPR revealed highest concordance.

TI Apparent diffusion coefficient mapping of salivary gland tumors:
   Prediction of the benignancy and malignancy
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

DT Article
ID PAROTID-GLAND; DIAGNOSTIC-VALUE; MR; LESIONS; HEAD
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative prediction of tumor malignancy is clinically very important, because this information strongly influences the surgical plan. We evaluate the preoperative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of benign and malignant salivary gland tumors.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution MR imaging was performed on 31 patients with benign or malignant salivary gland tumors; ADC maps of the tumors were also obtained. Surface coils of 47 or 110 mm diameter were used to improve the image resolution. The ADCs were compared with histologic features of the excised tumors.
   RESULTS: The ADC maps effectively depicted the histologic features of the salivary gland tumors, such as presence of cancer cells, myxomatous tissues, fibrosis, necrosis, cyst formation, and lymphoid tissues. The ADC maps showed that more frequent areas with high ADCs (>= 1.8 X 10(-3) mm(2)/s) were significantly greater in benign tumors than in malignant tumors. The sensitivity and specificity for high ADC occupying fewer than 5% of the area of a tumor was 89% and 100%, respectively, resulting in 97% accuracy, 100% positive predictive value, and 96% negative predictive value.
   CONCLUSION: The ADC may provide preoperative tissue characterization of the salivary gland tumors

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The HydroCoil Embolic System (HES) was developed reduce recurrences of aneurysms relative to platinum coils. This study was conducted to evaluate the recurrence rate of cerebral aneurysms 3-6 months after treatment with HES.
   METHODS: We report the results in 135 cerebral aneurysms treated with HES in a prospective multicenter registry. Angiographic results 3-6 months after treatment were evaluated at a core laboratory. Wide variation in HES utilization within the HydroCoil for Endovascular Aneurysm Occlusion (HEAL) registry (HES representing 5% to 100% of the coil length used) allowed for subgroup analysis with regard to percentage length, last coil used, and packing attenuation in small (< 10 mm) aneurysms.
   RESULTS: The overall recurrence rate was 38 (28.1 %) of 135, which included a number of large, giant, and previously recurrent aneurysms. When HES represented 75% of coil length, the recurrence rate was 0 (0%) of 18, whereas with < 75% length of HES, the recurrence rate was 16 (23%) of 71 (P = .035). When the final coil deposited was a HES coil, the recurrence rate was 6 (11 %) of 53, whereas when the final coil was platinum, the recurrence rate was 10 (29%) of 34 (P = .047). When the packing attenuation was >= 50%, the recurrence rate was 11 (19%) of 59, whereas for packing attenuation < 50%, the recurrence rate was 5 (18%) of 28. The packing attenuation calculations were very error-prone.
   CONCLUSION: Although the overall recurrence rates for small and large aneurysms in HEAL were no lower than published rates for aneurysms treated with platinum coils, patients treated in HEAL had a reduced recurrence rate when greater than 75% of the coil length used to treat an aneurysm was HES and when the final coil was HES.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy is a promising treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Few data are available on its use in elderly patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the baseline characteristics, complications, and outcomes between intra-arterially treated ischemic stroke patients aged >= 80 years and their younger counterparts.
   METHODS: Patients aged 80 years (n = 33) were compared retrospectively with contemporaneous patients aged < 80 years (n = 81) from a registry of consecutive patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis over a 9-year period.
   RESULTS: The very elderly and younger cohorts were very similar in baseline characteristics, including pretreatment stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] 17 versus 16), differing only in history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (42% versus 22%, P = .01) and weight (66.8 versus 75 8 kg; P = .02). Significant differences in recanalization (TIMI 2-3) rates could not be detected between the very elderly and younger patients (79% versus 68%, P = .10). Rates of major symptomatic hemorrhage (7% versus 8%) and any intracerebral hemorrhage (39% versus 37%) did not differ. Outcomes at 90 days showed lower rates of excellent functional outcome (mRS <= 1, 26% versus 40%, P = .02) and survival (57% versus 80%, P = .01) among the very elderly.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial fibrinolysis in the elderly can be accomplished with recanalization rates and hemorrhage rates equal to that in younger patients. Although mortality rates are higher and good functional outcomes are lower than in younger persons, nondisabling outcomes may be achieved in a quarter of patients. These findings suggest that the investigation and use of intra-arterial thrombolytic treatment in very elderly patients should not be avoided but pursued judiciously.

AB Background and Purpose: We sought to determine whether mid-sagittal intracranial area (ICA) is a valid surrogate of intracranial volume (ICV) when using retrospective data with relatively thick (6-7 mm) sagittal slices. Methods: Data were retrospectively analyzed from 47 subjects who had two MRI scans taken at least nine months apart. Twenty-three subjects had manual segmentation of ICV on the T2-weighted sequence for comparison. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for intraobserver, interobserver, and intraobserver scan-rescan comparisons were 0.96, 0.97 and 0.95. Pearson correlation coefficients between ICV and ICA, averaging the cumulative 1, 2, 3, and 4 most midline slices, were 0.89, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.95. There was a significant marginal increase in explained variance of ICV by measuring two, rather than one, slices (P = 0.001). Conclusions: These data suggest that ICA, even measured without high-resolution imaging, is a reasonable substitute for ICV.

AB Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the risks of endovascular therapy, aneurysm regrowth, recanalization and the need for reembolization.
   Method A prospective analysis was performed on 211 aneurysms treated endovascularly from February 2000 to December 2003. Of these 211 aneurysms, 81 were asymptomatic and 130 were ruptured. The risks of endovascular therapy, aneurysm regrowth, recanalization and the need for reembolization were evaluated.
   Results The mean observation time was 10 months (ranging from 178 to 830 days). Complete occlusion (100%) in the initial intervention was achieved in 171 of 201 aneurysms (85%), 80-95% occlusion in 24 aneurysms (12%), and < 80% occlusion in 6 aneurysms (3%). Recanalization had occurred at the first follow-up in 34 of all 153 aneurysms reassessed (22.2%). Of 133 aneurysms with initial 100% occlusion, 107 (80.4%) remained completely occluded, 17 (12.7%) showed recanalization, and 9 (6.7%) showed neck regrowth. Among those with 80-95% occlusion, 20 were reassessed, and of these 2 showed spontaneous occlusion, 10 (50%) still showed the initial neck, and 8 (40%) showed increased recanalization. One aneurysm which initially showed < 80% occlusion remained unchanged, and another showed showed recanalization. Of the 153 aneurysms, 12 (7.8%) were recoiled, 2 initially < 80% occluded, 7 initially 80-95% occluded and 3 initially totally occluded.
   Conclusion In spite of low morbidity and mortality, one in four aneurysms will show recurrence. The initial degree of occlusion seems to have an influence on the likelihood of recanalization.

AB Introduction Until recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, was mainly used to study brain physiology. The activation signal measured with fMRI is based upon the changes in the concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin that arise from an increase in blood flow in the vicinity of neuronal firing. Technical limitations have impeded such research in the human cervical spinal cord. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether a reliable fMRI signal can be elicited from the cervical spinal cord during fingertapping, a complex motor activity. Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether the fMRI signal could be spatially localized to the particular neuroanatomical location specific for this task.
   Methods A group of 12 right-handed healthy volunteers performed the complex motor task of fingertapping with their right hand. T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging on a 1.5-T clinical unit was used to image the cervical spinal cord. Motion correction was applied. Cord activation was measured in the transverse imaging plane, between the spinal cord levels C5 and T1.
   Results In all subjects spinal cord responses were found, and in most of them on the left and the right side. The distribution of the activation response showed important variations between the subjects. While regions of activation were distributed throughout the spinal cord, concentrated activity was found at the anatomical location of expected motor innervation, namely nerve root C8, in 6 of the 12 subjects.
   Conclusion fMRI of the human cervical spinal cord on an 1.5-T unit detects neuronal activity related to a complex motor task. The location of the neuronal activation (spinal cord segment C5 through T1 with a peak on C8) corresponds to the craniocaudal anatomical location of the neurons that activate the muscles in use.

AB Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis of viral encephalitis and its relationship with the stage of the illness.
   Methods We performed conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) including T1-W, T2-W and fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR) sequences and DWI in 18 patients with viral encephalitis diagnosed on the basis of laboratory, clinical and radiologic findings. Based on the qualitative and quantitative comparison of the conventional MRI and DWI, the patients were divided into three groups. Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) values of the involved and contralateral normal brain tissues were computed and compared for each group. The degree of correlation between the time (TI) from the onset of neurologic symptoms to the MR examination and ADC values was determined.
   Results In group I (n=11) DWI was superior to conventional MRI in detecting the encephalitic involved sites and in depicting the borders of the encephalitic lesions. In group II (n=4) DWI was similar to conventional MRI. In group III (n=3) conventional MRI was superior to DWI. Mean ADC values of affected versus contralateral normal brain tissues were 0.458+/-0.161 x 10(-3) versus 0.86 +/- 0.08 x 10(-3) in group I, 0.670 +/- 0.142 x 10(-3) versus 0.93 +/- 0.07 x 10(-3) in group II, and 1.413 +/- 0.211 x 10(-3) versus 1.05 +/- 0.06 x 10(-3) in group III. Patients in group I had significantly lower ADC values than those in group II, while patients in group III had the highest ADC values ( P< 0.05). The ADC values were significantly lower in the affected sites than in the unaffected sites of patients in groups I and II, but were significantly higher in the affected sites than in the unaffected sites of patients in group III ( P< 0.05). There was an excellent correlation between ADC values and duration of the disease (r= 0.874, P= 0.01).
   Conclusion DWI is superior to other conventional diagnostic MR sequences in the detection of early viral encephalitic lesions and depiction of the lesion borders and, in combination with other sequences, DWI may contribute to the determination of the disease phase.

AB Introduction Hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum (HSP-TCC) is a complicated form of autosomal-recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia. Characteristic clinical features comprise progressive spastic gait, cognitive impairment, and ataxia. Diagnostic MRI findings include thinning of the corpus callosum and non-progressive white matter (WM) alterations.
   Methods To study the extent of axonal involvement, we performed localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the cerebral WM and cortical grey matter (GM) in a patient with HSP-TCC at 20 and 25 years of age. The second investigation included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
   Results While MRS of the GM was normal, affected WM was characterized by major metabolic alterations such as reduced concentrations of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate, creatine and phosphocreatine, and choline-containing compounds as well as elevated levels of myo-inositol. These abnormalities showed progression over a period of 5 years. DTI revealed increased mean diffusivity as well as reduced fractional anisotropy in periventricular WM. The metabolic and structural findings are consistent with progressive neuroaxonal loss in the WM accompanied by astrocytic proliferation-histopathological changes known to occur in HSP-TCC.
   Conclusion Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the primary pathological process in HSP-TCC affects the axon, possibly due to impaired axonal trafficking.

ID SURGICAL-TREATMENT; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; SHEAR-STRESS; HEMODYNAMICS;
   RUPTURE; WALL
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of unequal physiologic flow conditions in the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) on the hemodynamics of anterior communicating artery aneurysms.
   METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models of 2 cerebral aneurysms were constructed from bilateral 3D rotational angiograms. The flow dynamics of the aneurysm sac were analyzed under the effect of unequal mean flows, phase shifts, and waveforms between the ICAs. A total of 9 simulations were performed for each patient; cine flow velocity simulations and unsteady wall shear stress (WSS) maps were created for each flow condition. Time-dependent curves of average WSS magnitude over selected regions on the aneurysms were constructed.
   RESULTS: Mean flow unbalances in the feeding vessels tended to shift the regions of elevated WSS towards the dominating inflow jet and to change the magnitude of the WSS peaks. The overall qualitative appearance of the WSS distribution and velocity simulations was not substantially affected. Phase and waveform asymmetry increased the temporal complexity of the hemodynamic patterns and tended to destabilize the flow pattern.
   CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the relative phase and waveform shape in ICAs can significantly affect the complexity and stability of the hemodynamic force distributions. The magnitude of these effects is related to the geometry of the aneurysm and the feeding vessels. Conditions affecting the flow characteristics in the parent arteries of cerebral aneurysms with more than 1 avenue of inflow should be incorporated into flow models.

ID VENOUS CONGESTION; COVERED STENT; FACIAL VEIN; BRAIN-STEM; FOLLOW-UP;
   SINUS; DRAINAGE; GRAFT; IMPLANTATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe the results of transvenous embolizations of cavernous dural arteriovenous fistua (cDAVF) with an emphasis on identifying the incidence, characteristics, and management strategies associated with the complications of transvenous embolization of cDAVFs.
   METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients who were treated by transvenous embolization for cDAVFs were reviewed. The approach routes, angiographic results, complications, and clinical outcome were assessed.
   RESULTS: Retrograde inferior petrosal sinus (n = 36), transfacial vein (n = 7), transcontralateral intercavernous sinus (n = 4), and direct superior ophthalmic vein (n = 3) approaches were used. Angiographic results showed complete occlusion (n = 29), nearly complete occlusion (n = 13), and incomplete occlusion (n = 14). Complications associated with the procedures were cranial nerve palsy (n = 6), venous perforation (n = 3), and brain stem congestion (n = 2). The cranial nerve signs resolved with conservative treatment. Venous perforations were managed by coil embolizations at the site of the tear with no significant neurologic sequelae. One case of brain stem congestion resulted in henniplegia after conservative treatment. The other case showed venous congestion as a result of rerouting of the shunted flow after venous embolization that was successfully managed by covered stent deployment for occlusion of the residual feeders. Clinical follow-up data were available in 46 patients. Complete resolution or improvement of symptoms was seen in 42 patients (91%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cavernous DAVFs may be effectively treated by transvenous embolization. However, the procedure can be associated with various complications, some of which can potentially result in significant morbidity. Prompt diagnosis of the complications with appropriate management strategies is mandatory for a safe procedure.

AB Vascular diseases like aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and direct high-flow carotid-cavernous fistulas on the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery are usually managed through transarterial embolization with detachable coils or balloons. Utility of covered stents has been reported with good results in the treatment of selective cases. But the current generation of covered stents for coronary use is rather stiff and difficult to navigate in tortuous vessels particularly in the intracranial vasculature. Herein, we report on the use and technical respects of balloon-expanded covered stents specially designed for intracranial vasculature in the treatment of two pseudoaneurysms secondary to the successful obliteration of direct CCFs on the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery. This is the first report of covered stents specially developed for use in intracranial vasculature.

AB Introduction We present an original three-dimensional cephalometric analysis based on a transformation of a classical two dimensional topological cephalometry.
   Methods To validate the three-dimensional cephalometric CT based concept we systematically compared the alignments of anatomic structures. We used digital lateral radiography to perform the classical two-dimensional cephalometry, and a three-dimensional CT surface model for the three-dimensional cephalometry.
   Results Diagnoses based on both two-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses were adequate, but the three-dimensional analysis gave more information such as the possibility of comparing the right and left side of the skull. Also the anatomic structures were not superimposed which improved the visibility of the reference landmarks.
   Conclusion We demonstrated that three-dimensional analysis gives the same results as two-dimensional analysis using the same skull. We also present possible applications of the method.

TI Cerebral ischemia after filter-protected carotid artery stenting is
   common and cannot be predicted by the presence of substantial amount of
   debris captured by the filter device
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENDARTERECTOMY; ANGIOPLASTY; INFARCTS; BRAIN; RISK
AB PURPOSE: Protected carotid artery stent placement is currently under clinical evaluation as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy. The current study was undertaken to determine the incidence of new ischemic lesions found on diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in nonselected patients after protected carotid artery stent placement using a filter device and to determine the potential relationship between these new ischernic lesions and the presence or absence of a clear amount of debris captured by the neuroprotection filter device.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nonrandomized cohort of 52 patients (40 men, 12 women) presenting with carotid occlusive disease underwent protected carotid artery stent placement using a filter device. DWI obtained 1 day before stent placement was compared with that obtained 1 day after stent placement. In addition, the macroscopic and microscopic analysis of debris captured by the filter device during the carotid stent placement procedure was assessed.
   RESULTS: Neuroprotected carotid stent placement was technically successful in all 53 procedures but was complicated by a transient ischemic attack in 3 patients (5.6%). In 22 patients (41.5%), new ischemic lesions were found on DWI, and in 21 filter devices (39.6%), a substantial amount of atheromatous plaque and/or fibrin was found. No clear relationship between the presence of debris captured by the filter device and new lesions detected by DWI was found (P = .087; odds ratio 3.067).
   CONCLUSION: Neuroprotected carotid artery stent placement will not avoid silent cerebral ischemia. Systematic microscopic analysis of debris captured by the filter device has no predictive value for potential cerebral ischemia after carotid artery stent placement.

AB Our aim was to examine hemodynamic implications of intravascular stenting in the canine venous pouch (sidewall or straight-vessel) and rabbit elastase (curved-vessel) aneurysm models. Flow dynamics in stented (Wallstent) and nonstented versions were studied by using computational fluid dynamics simulations and in vitro flow visualization, with a focus on stent placement effects on aneurysmal flow stagnancy and flow impingement. Results show that sidewall and curved aneurysm models have fundamentally different hemodynamics (shear-driven versus inertia-driven) and thus stent placement outcomes.

   BIOMECHANICS; LEAKAGE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There exists significant variability in the volume of polymethylmethacrylate cement injected during percutaneous vertebroplasty. Larger cement volumes injected may be associated with better clinical outcomes, but larger volumes may also be associated with greater risk of complications related to cement leakage. We describe an analysis of the association between clinical and procedural variables, including cement volume injected, and the clinical outcomes of patients treated with single-level vertebroplasty.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 158 patients treated with single-level vertebroplasty was performed. Relationships among patient and procedural variables and relationships between these variables and ordinal clinical outcome scores of pain and medication use at postprocedure time points from 1 week to 2 years were evaluated with bivariate and multivariable analyses.
   RESULTS: There was no significant association between the volume of cement injected and the clinical outcomes of postprocedure pain (P = .159-871) and medication use (P = .223-.875).
   CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty operators need not feel compelled to achieve particular cement volumes injected in the pursuit of better clinical outcomes but should strive to achieve the maximal safe filling of individual vertebral bodies.

   WHITE-MATTER; SPECTROSCOPY; RADIOTHERAPY; COEFFICIENT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The efficacy of radiation therapy, the mainstay of treatment for malignant gliomas, is limited by our inability to accurately determine tumor margins. As a result, despite recent advances, the prognosis remains appalling. Because gliomas preferentially infiltrate along white matter tracks, methods that show white matter disruption should improve this delineation. In this study, results of histologic examination from samples obtained from image-guided brain biopsies were correlated with diffusion tensor images.
   METHODS: Twenty patients requiring image-guided biopsies for presumed gliomas were imaged preoperatively. Patients underwent image-guided biopsies with multiple biopsies taken along a single track that went into normal-appearing brain. Regions of interest were determined from the sites of the biopsies, and diffusion tensor imaging findings were compared with glioma histology.
   RESULTS: Using diffusion tissue signatures, it was possible to differentiate gross tumor (reduction of the anisotropic component, q > 12% from contralateral region), from tumor infiltration (increase in the isotropic component, p > 10% from contralateral region). This technique has a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 81%. T2-weighted abnormalities failed to identify the margin in half of all specimens.
   CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor imaging can better delineate the tumor margin in gliomas. Such techniques can improve the delineation of the radiation therapy target volume for gliomas and potentially can direct local therapies for tumor infiltration.

All patients had round well-defined ovoid hyperintense splenial lesions (14.94 +/- 1.87 mm) on DWI with a significantly low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of 0.41 +/- 0.05 X 10(-3) mm(2)/s compared with 0.84 +/- 0.01 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s of normal-appea ring white matter. In the patient with a motor deficit, additional lesions were found in the cerebral deep white matter. The high signal intensity of the splenial and deep white matter lesions on DWI completely disappeared on follow-up studies, and ADC values also improved, returning to those of normal-appearing white matter on days 8-11. Clinically, all patients completely recovered on days 4-9.
   CONCLUSION: A transient lesion of the SCC is a significant but nonspecific finding. It is probably due to edematous and/or inflammatory changes of the SCC. It may be the only detectable change in patients with good prognosis, indicating a clinically mild form of encephalitis/encephalopathy.

AB Background/Purpose: Gray matter involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) is of growing interest with respect to disease pathogenesis. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), an advanced MRI technique, is sensitive to disease in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with MS.
   Design/Methods: We tested if MTI detected subcortical (deep) gray matter abnormalities in patients with MS (n = 60) vs. age-matched normal controls (NL, n = 20). Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) maps were produced from axial proton density, conventional spin-echo, 5 mm gapless slices covering the whole brain. Region-of-interest-derived MTR histograms for the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and NAWM were obtained. Whole brain MTR was also measured.
   Results: Mean whole brain MTR and the peak position of the NAWM MTR histogram were lower in patients with MS than NL (P < .001) and mean whole brain MTR was lower in secondary progressive (SP, n = 10) than relapsing-remitting (RR, n = 50, P < .001) patients. However, none of the subcortical gray matter nuclei showed MTR differences in MS vs. NL, RR vs. SP, or SP vs. NL.
   Conclusions: The MTI technique used in this cohort was relatively insensitive to disease in the deep gray matter nuclei despite showing sensitivity for whole brain disease in MS. It remains to be determined if other MRI techniques are more sensitive than MTI for detecting pathology in these areas.

AB Background. Stroke mechanism in patent foramen ovale (PFO) and/or atrioseptal aneurysm (ASA) remains unclear. We aimed to study the stroke pattern on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), in cryptogenetic stroke according to septal abnormalities.
   Methods. We prospectively evaluated 314 cryptogenetic strokes. Patients were categorized according to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) findings: PFO with ASA, PFO alone, and no abnormalities. The study group consisted of 126 patients with acute DWI lesions within the first 7 days after the stroke onset. We considered the presence of scattered lesions or a cortico-subcortical territorial lesion as highly suggestive of an embolic pattern.
   Results. PFO was identified in 77 patients (61%) and no alterations in 49 patients (39%). TEE revealed ASA in 42 patients (54.5% of PFO patients). An "embolic" pattern was depicted in 84 (66.7%) and subcortical in 42 (33.3%). An "embolic" pattern was significantly (P = .01) more frequently seen in PFO with ASA patients (n = 37;44%) as compared to PFO without ASA (n = 22; 26.2%) or no abnormalities (n = 25; 29.8%) on TEE. Univariate analysis revealed that age (P = .06), hyperlipidemia (P = .04), degree of shunt on TEE (P = .002), and the presence of an ASA (P = .008) were associated with an embolic pattern. After adjusting for sex, age, and vascular risk factors, only the presence of PFO, with ASA (OR 7.27; 95% CI 1.5-35.22 P = .014) was independently associated with an embolic pattern.
   Conclusion. In patients with cryptogenetic stroke, the presence of PFO with ASA, but not isolated PFO, is associated with an embolic pattern on DWI. These findings provide insights into the patho-mechanism of stroke in patients with PFO.

   RELEVANCE
AB Background. Studies have shown an association between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and improved stroke outcomes, possibly secondary to neuroprotective properties.
   Objective. To assess whether patients taking statins prior to ischemic stroke have smaller infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), adjusting for other relevant clinical factors.
   Design. We retrospectively reviewed the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) Neurology Inpatient Database from June 2002 through June 2004. Demographics, medications, stroke subtype, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volume, admission NIHSS, and hours to MRI were collected. Patients with a nonlacunar middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct and MRI less than 48 hours from symptom onset were included (n = 143). A multivariable linear regression model was constructed to determine independent predictors of smaller infarct volume.
   Results. A total of 143 patients were studied, including 38 patients taking statins at the time of their stroke. In univariate analysis, patients using statins were significantly more likely to have a history of hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease and to be using coumadin, antiplatelet drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Patients on statins had a tendency toward smaller infarcts in univariate analysis (median 25.4 cm(3) vs. 15.5 cm(3), P = 0.054). In multivariable linear regression analysis statin use, patient age, and TIA within the prior 4 weeks were independently associated with smaller DWI volumes; vessel occlusion on vascular imaging, and cardioembolic stroke subtype with larger infarct size.
   Conclusions. Statin use prior to the onset of nonlacunar MCA infarction was associated with a smaller infarct volume independent of other factors. Further studies utilizing both clinical and radiologic outcomes will be required to confirm these findings.

AB Introduction We analyzed the imaging features of transient focal lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) in non-epileptic patients receiving antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
   Methods We identified signal abnormalities in the SCC in three non-epileptic patients, all of them receiving AEDs. We examined two of these patients with multiplanar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using 1.0-T equipment including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2-weighted (TSE) and T1-weighted (SE) sequences before and after injection of contrast agent. The third patient was studied using 1.5-T equipment with the same sequences. Additionally, a T1 SE sequence with a magnetization transfer contrast pulse off resonance (T1 SE/MTC), diffusion-weighted imaging (EPI-DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained.
   Results We observed an identical pattern of imaging abnormalities in all patients characterized by round lesions, hyperintense on FLAIR and hypointense on T1 SE images, located in the central portion of the SCC. One lesion showed homogeneous gadolinium enhancement and perilesional vasogenic edema. This particular lesion showed restricted diffusion confirmed on the ADC map. This pattern was considered consistent with focal demyelination. Follow-up MR examinations showed complete disappearance or a clear reduction in lesion size. All patients had been treated with AEDs, but they did not show any clinical signs of toxicity, interhemispheric symptoms, or abnormal neurological findings (including seizures).
   Conclusion We believe that our MR findings might be interpreted as transient lesions related to AED toxicity. They presumably resulted from focal demyelination in the central portion of the SCC.

AB Introduction Previous studies in apes and monkeys have shown that the red nucleus receives projections from the sensorimotor and premotor cortices, whereas other experiments carried out with injured human brains have found corticorubral projections issuing from associative areas. Therefore, we reassessed in vivo the human anatomical projections from the cerebral cortex to the red nucleus using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) axonal tracking.
   Methods The connectivity between the cerebral cortex and the red nuclei of seven volunteers was studied at 1.5 T using streamlined DTI axonal tracking.
   Results Trajectories were constantly tracked between the red nuclei and the ipsilateral pericentral and prefrontal cortices, as well as the temporal cortex and the striatum in two subjects. Within the cerebral trunk, trajectories also include the superior cerebellar peduncle and the central tegmental tract.
   Conclusion The human red nucleus receives its main afferences from the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To report morbidity, mortality, and angiographic results of elective coiling of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: In a 10-year period, 176 unruptured aneurysms in 149 patients were electively treated with detachable coils. Seventy-nine aneurysms were additional to another ruptured aneurysm but were coiled more than 3 months after subarachnoid hemorrhage, 59 aneurysms were incidentally discovered, and 38 aneurysms presented with symptoms of mass effect. Mean size of the 176 unruptured aneurysms was 10.6 mm (median, 8 mm; range, 2-55 mm). One hundred thirteen aneurysms (64%) were small (< 10 mm), 44 aneurysms (25%) were large (10-25 mm), and 19 aneurysms (11%) were giant (25-55 mm). Thirty wide-necked aneurysms (17%) were coiled with the aid of a supporting device.
   RESULTS: Procedural mortality of coiling was 1.3% (2 of 149; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.7-5.1%), and morbidity was 2.6% (4 of 149, 95% Cl, 0.8-7.0%). The 4 patients with permanent morbidity were independent (GOS 4). Initial aneurysm occlusion was complete (100%) in 132 aneurysms, nearly complete (90%-98%) in 36 aneurysms, and incomplete (60%-85%) in 8 aneurysms. Six-month follow-up angiography was available in 132 patients with 154 coiled aneurysms (87.5%); partial reopening occurred in 25, mainly large and giant aneurysms (16.2%). Additional coiling was performed in 22 aneurysms and additional parent vessel occlusion in 1 aneurysm. There were no complications of additional treatments.
   CONCLUSION: Elective coiling of unruptured intracranial aneurysms has low procedural mortality and morbidity. For the management of unruptured aneurysms, endovascular treatment should be considered.

   CANCER; BRAIN; LENS; IRRADIATION; PARAMETERS; MRI
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess patient radiation exposure in comprehensive stroke imaging using multidetector row CT (MDCT) combining standard CT of the head, cerebral perfusion (CTP), and CT angiography (CTA) studies.
   METHODS: Examination protocols for CT and CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, as well as CTP were simulated using a Somatom Sensation Cardiac 64. Effective doses were derived from measurements with the use of lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (LiF-TLD) at several organ sites using an Alderson-Rando phantom.
   RESULTS: LiF-TLD measurements resulted in effective doses of 1.7 mSv for CT, 1.9 mSv for CTA of intracranial vessels, and 2.8 mSv for CTA of cervical vessels, respectively. Depending on examination parameters, effective doses varied between 1.1 and 5.0 mSv for cerebral CTP. For CTP, local doses in the area of the primary beam ranged between 114 and 444 mGy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive stroke imaging may result in up to 9.5 mSv with possible local doses of 490 mGy. Although critical doses for organ damage (eg, cataract formation or hair loss) are not reached, physicians need to be aware of possible radiation induced sequelae particularly in repetitive examinations.

AB Introduction: Differential radiologic diagnosis of cystic malformations of the posterior fossa is often difficult with conventional imaging techniques because of overlapping features of these entities. Posterior fossa cystic malformations occupy the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces. They may create secondary dynamic effects on the movements of CSF. The aim of this study was to investigate CSF flow alterations in posterior fossa cystic malformations with CSF flow MR imaging. Methods: The study included 40 patients with cystic malformations of the posterior fossa. The patients underwent cardiac-gated phase-contrast cine MR imaging. CSF flow was qualitatively evaluated using an in-plane phase-contrast sequence in the midsagittal plane. The MR images were displayed in a closed-loop cine format. Results: Twelve of the patients had communicating arachnoid cyst, seven had non-communicating arachnoid cyst, ten had mega cisterna magna, six had Dandy-Walker malformation, two had Dandy-Walker variant, and three had Blake's pouch cyst. CSF flow MR imaging indicated the regions of no, slow or higher flow, direction of flow, and abnormal cystic fluid motion. Each malformation displayed a distinct CSF flow pattern. Conclusion: Phase-contrast cine MR imaging for CSF flow evaluation may be a useful adjunct to routine MR imaging in the evaluation of the cystic malformations of the posterior fossa because it can improve the specificity in differentiating such malformations.

TI [C-11]Methionine PET, histopathology, and survival in primary brain

   RADIATION-INJURY; F-18-FDG PET; FDG PET; METHIONINE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: [C-11]Methionine (MET) PET imaging is a sensitive technique for visualizing primary brain tumors and recurrence/progression after therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the uptake of MET and histopathologic grading and to investigate the prognostic value of the tracer, in both settings.
   METHODS: Cerebral uptake of MET was determined in 52 patients: in 26 patients for primary staging (group A) and 26 patients with suspected brain tumor recurrence/progression after therapy (group B). Senniquantitative methionine uptake indices (UI) defined by the tumor (maximum)-to-background ratio was correlated with tumor grade and final outcome.
   RESULTS: Overall median survival was 34.9 months. MET showed pathologically increased uptake in 41 of 52 scans. Although a weak linear correlation between MET uptake and grading was observed (R = 0.38, P =.028), analysis of variance showed no significant differences in MET UI between tumor grades for either group A or B. Benign and grade I lesions showed significant difference in MET uptake in comparison with higher grade lesions (P=.006). Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, no thresholds could be found at which MET was predictive for survival. Proportional hazard regression showed that only WHO grading class (low versus high) was predictive of survival (P=.015).
   CONCLUSION: Interindividual MET uptake variability does not allow noninvasive grading on an individual patient basis. Moreover, there is no significant prognostic value in studying maximal methionine U I in brain tumors. The clinical use of MET should therefore be primarily focused on questions such as detection of recurrence, biopsy guidance, and radiation therapy target volume delineation.

TI Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Comparative analysis of MR imaging sequences
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID 14-3-3 PROTEIN; DIAGNOSIS; ABNORMALITIES; ACCURACY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging has played an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) since basal ganglia abnormalities on T2-weighted images have been described; thus, the aim of our study was to compare the value of different MR images in the diagnosis of CJD.
   METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with CJD underwent MR imaging examinations. Ninety-two patients were neuropathologically confirmed, and 65 were clinically classified as having CJD through the CJD Surveillance Unit (probability of 95%). There was no standardized MR imaging protocol; thus, the examinations included 143 T2-weighted, 43 proton attenuation (PD)-weighted, 84 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and 44 diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The MR images were reviewed for pathologic changes of the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebral cortex.
   RESULTS: Cortical abnormalities were present in 70 patients (45%) and were visible in 80% (35/44) of all available DWI examinations. The basal ganglia were affected in 94 patients (60%), in particular in the caudate nucleus; the most sensitive sequences were DWI (64%) and PD-weighted (63%). A thalamic involvement was more frequently diagnosed on PD-weighted images (19%) and DWI (14%) than on FLAIR or T2-weighted images.
   CONCLUSION: PD-weighted images and DWI showed better results in the diagnosis of signal intensity changes in the basal ganglia compared with T2-weighted or FLAIR images; however, in the diagnosis of cortical changes, DWI was clearly superior, Our data suggest that DWI is the most sensitive MR imaging technique in the diagnosis of CJD.

DT Article
ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; ANEURYSMS; EMBOLIZATION; FUSIFORM;
   PSEUDOANEURYSM; OCCLUSION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment with stent placement or stent-assisted coiling was recently introduced as an alternative to parent artery occlusion in intracranial vertebral artery dissections. We describe the efficacy and limitations of this method.
   METHODS: Fourteen patients with intracranial vertebral artery dissection were treated with stent placement (10 patients) or stent-assisted coiling (4 patients). Double overlapping stents were deployed in 4 of 10 patients with stent placement alone. Angiographic follow-up at 6 to 12 months was available in 13 patients.
   RESULTS: In 13 patients with dissecting aneurysm, immediate angiographic outcomes were complete occlusion (1 patient), nearly complete (2 patients), and incomplete (110 patients). Follow-up angiograms of 12 of these patients showed complete occlusion (6 patients) and incomplete (6 patients; 1 unstable and 5 stable). Complete occlusion rates in follow-up angiograms were superior in double stent placement (75%) or stent-assisted Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization to stent placement alone (0%). There were no instances of postprocedural ischemic attacks, new neurologic deficits, and no new minor or major strokes before patient discharge. On the modified Rankin scale applied in follow-up, all patients were assessed as functionally improved or of stable clinical status.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial vertebral artery dissections were acceptably treated with stent placement or stent-assisted coiling, and the patency could be preserved at follow-up. However, the efficiency of stent placement alone for intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm was limited. Stent-assisted coil embolization or double stent placements are a viable alternative for complete occlusion of dissecting aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Results from cerebral proton H-1-MR spectroscopy studies of neonates with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury have generally been presented as metabolite peak-area ratios, which are T1 and T2-weighted, rather than absolute metabolite concentrations. We hypothesized that compared with 1H-MR spectroscopy peak-area ratios, calculation of absolute metabolite concentrations and relaxation times measured within the first 4 days after birth (1) would improve prognostic accuracy and (2) enhance the understanding of underlying neurochemical changes in neonates with neonatal encephalopathy.
   METHODS: Seventeen term infants with neonatal encephalopathy and 10 healthy controls were studied at 2.4T at 1 (1-3) and 2 (2-4) (median [interquartile range]) days afterbirth, respectively. Infants with neonatal encephalopathy were classified into 2 outcome groups (normal/mild and severe/fatal), according to neurodevelopmental assessments at 1 year. The MR spectroscopy peak-area ratios, relaxation times, absolute concentrations, and concentration ratios of lactate (Lac), creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and choline-containing compounds (Cho) from a voxel centered on the thalami were analyzed according to outcome group.
   RESULTS: Comparing the severe/fatal group with the controls (significance assumed with P < 0.05), we found that Lac/NAA, Lac/Cho, and Lac/Cr peak-area ratios increased and NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho decreased; Lac, NAA, and Cr T2s were increased; [Lac] was increased and [Cho], [Cr], and [NAA] decreased; and among the concentration ratios, only [Lac]/[NAA] was increased. Comparison of the normal/mild group with controls revealed no differences in peak-area ratios, relaxation times, or concentration ratios but decreased [NAA], [Cho], and [Cr] were observed in the infants with normal/mild outcome. Comparison of the normal/mild and severe/fatal groups showed increased Lac/NAA and Lac/Cho and decreased NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho peak-area ratios, reduced [NAA], and increased Lac T2 in the infants with the worse outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Metabolite concentrations, in particular [NAA], enhance the prognostic accuracy of cerebral H-1-MR spectroscopy-[NAA] was the only measurable to discriminate among all (control, normal/mild, and severe/fatal outcome) groups. However, peak-area ratios are more useful prognostic indicators than concentration ratios because they depend on metabolite concentrations and T2s, both of which are pathologically modulated. Concentration ratios depend only on the concentrations of the constituent metabolites. Increased Cr T2 may provide an indirect marker of impaired cellular energetics, and similarly, NAA T2 may constitute an index of exclusively neuronal energy status. Our recommendation is to collect data that enable calculation of brain metabolite concentrations. However, if time constraints make this impossible, metabolite peak-area ratios provide the next best method of assigning early prognosis in neonatal encephalopathy.

   OCCLUSIVE DISEASE; EXPERIENCE; INFARCTION; ARTERIES; STROKE
AB Background and Purpose. Endovascular treatment for intracranial atherosclerosis is evolving, but complications remain an issue. Most interventions are performed under general anesthesia, preventing intraprocedural clinical evaluations. We describe our approach to intracranial angioplasty and stenting, using local rather than general anesthesia, and intraprocedural neurological assessment.
   Methods. We prospectively collected procedural and outcome information on all patients undergoing intracranial angioplasty and stenting. Patients underwent interventions under local anesthesia with mild intravenous sedation or analgesia only if needed. Intraoperative neurological evaluations were performed, and symptomatology was used to guide the interventional technique.
   Results. Forty-eight arteries in 40 patients with a mean age of 65.2 years were treated. Thirty-two anterior and 16 posterior circulation segments were treated. Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients with reduction of the mean pretreatment stenosis from 85 +/- 8.6% to 7 +/- 10.1%. Stents were deployed in 40 segments; five patients were treated with drug-eluting stents. The cobalt-chromium coronary stents were the easiest to deliver. Thirty-seven patients were treated under local anesthesia and, of those, 61.4% experienced intraprocedural symptoms that led to some alteration of the interventional technique. Headache was the most common symptom, and, when persistent, it heralded the occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were seven total neurological complications, but only five (10.5%) led to permanent morbidity (4 strokes) or mortality (1 death).
   Conclusions. Intracranial angioplasty and stenting can be successfully performed using coronary techniques and equipment including drug-eluting stents. Local anesthesia permits neurological evaluations and often leads to the adjustment of the interventional technique, potentially making the procedure safer.

TI Brain MRI in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation with and

DT Article
ID HALLERVORDEN-SPATZ-SYNDROME; DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA, formerly called Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome) often have mutations in PANK2, the gene encoding pantothenate kinase 2. We investigated correlations between brain MR imaging changes, mutation status, and clinical disease features.
   METHODS: Brain MRIs from patients with NBIA were reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists for technical factors, including signal intensity abnormalities in specific brain regions, presence and location of atrophy, presence of white matter abnormality, contrast enhancement, and other comments. PANK2 genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of patient genomic DNA followed by automated nucleotide sequencing.
   RESULTS: Sixty-six MR imaging examinations from 49 NBIA patients were analyzed, including those from 29 patients with mutations in PANK2. All patients with mutations had the specific pattern of globus pallidus central hyperintensity with surrounding hypointensity on T2-weighted images, known as the eye-of-the-tiger sign. This sign was not seen in any studies from patients without mutations. Even before the globus pallidus hypointensity developed, patients with mutations could be distinguished by the presence of isolated globus pallidus hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. Radiographic evidence for iron deposition in the substantia nigra was absent early in disease associated with,PANK2 mutations. MR imaging abnormalities outside the globus pallidus, including cerebral or cerebellar atrophy, were more common and more severe in mutation-negative patients. No specific MR imaging changes could be distinguished among the mutation-negative patients.
   CONCLUSION: MR imaging signal intensity abnormalities in the globus pallidus can distinguish patients with mutations in PANK2 from those lacking a mutation, even in the early stages of disease.

TI Diffusion-weighted MR imaging lesions after filter-protected stenting of

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY

DT Article
ID CEREBRAL PROTECTION; EMBOLIC EVENTS; DEVICES; ANGIOGRAPHY; PLACEMENT;
   ENDARTERECTOMY; ANGIOPLASTY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical efficacy of filter devices in internal carotid artery (ICA) stent placement has been a matter of controversy. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the number and extent of cerebral emboli, as represented by new lesions on diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI), in patients treated with filter-protected carotid stent placement.
   METHODS: Standard DWI (B0 = 1000) was performed within 48 hours before and 48 hours after filter-protected carotid stent placement in 50 patients with symptomatic, high grade > 70%), atherosclerotic ICA stenosis. Number, extent, and vascular territory of new DWI lesions after stent placement were assessed by consensus of 2 experienced neuroradiologists. Multifactorial statistical analysis was performed to determine risk factors associated with DWI lesions.
   RESULTS: New punctate DWI lesions with a median diameter of 2 mm were detected in 14 of 50 cases in the territory of the stented ICA and in 7 of 50 cases in other vascular territories. Median lesion load was I lesion (range, 1-15) per positive case in the stented ICA and I lesion (range, 1-7) in other vascular territories. All DWI lesions were clinically asymptomatic. Because of I hyperperfusion syndrome with temporary brain swelling, the 30-day stroke and death rate was 2%. Age >= 70 years was the only significant predictor for new DWI lesions, whereas sex, degree and site of stenosis, vascular risk factors, and stent and filter type showed no significant correlation.
   CONCLUSIONS: New DWI lesions after filter-protected carotid stent placement are substantially more frequent in the ipsilateral ICA territory compared with other vascular territories. Therefore, intraluminal filters cannot completely protect the brain from procedure-related embolization. However, individual lesion load and the risk of clinically relevant ischemia is low.

   ANEURYSMS; HELICAL CT; SURGICAL FINDINGS; DSA; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 3D computed tomographic angiography (3DCTA) has been used recently for the evaluation of intracerebral aneurysms, but it is difficult to use this technique to visualize aneurysms near the base of the skull because of the presence of bone. Subtracted 3DCTA could replace digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for evaluation of aneurysms near the base of the skull if the 2 methods were to give similar results. The aim of this study was to compare the evaluation of aneurysms of the internal carotid artery (ICA) near the base of the skull by subtracted 3DCTA and DSA.
   METHODS: CTA and DSA were obtained in 25 patients with unruptured aneurysms of the ICA. To create subtracted 3DCTA images, we used a volume subtraction (VS) method, wherein nonenhanced volume data are subtracted from enhanced volume data. CTA and DSA were reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists who performed the detection and characterization of aneurysms of the ICA by using 2D multiplanar reformatted (MPR) and VS- and nonsubtracted (NS)-3DCTA images with volume rendering techniques.
   RESULTS: DSA detected 29 aneurysms in the 25 patients. VS-3DCTA detected all 29 aneurysms in the 25 patients and was equivalent to DSA for evaluating their characteristics (location, size, and direction). NS-3DCTA detected 19 (1 cavernous, 4 ophthalmic, 1 superior hypophyseal, 7 posterior communicating, and 6 anterior choroidal artery) of these 29 aneurysms, but it could not characterize ophthalmic and superior hypophyseal artery aneurysms because they were only partly visible on NS-3DCTA because of bony structures. 2D-MPR images detected all but the small aneurysms (24 of 29 detected). VS-3DCTA and 2D-MPR could visualize all branching arteries (ophthalmic, posterior communicating, and anterior choroidal) detected by DSA, but NS-3DCTA could not visualize ophthalmic arteries because of the presence of bony structures.
   CONCLUSION: VS-3DCTA can be used as an alternative to DSA for preoperative examination of aneurysms near the skull base, where it provides equivalent identification and characterization.

AB Three patients with spontaneous dural carotid-cavernous fistulas were treated by using a the combination of detachable coils and Onyx liquid embolic agent. Cavernous sinus was accessed via the superior opthalmic vein or inferior petrous sinus approach. In all cases, a complete angiograp closure of the fistulas was achieved with full recovery from neuro-ophthaimologic symptoms. This report suggests that the controlled and excellent penetration of Onyx is superb for blocking the intricate communication of dural carotid-cavernous fistulas.

   GLIOMAS; WEIGHTED MRI; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MEDULLOBLASTOMA; CLASSIFICATION;
   CELLULARITY; RECURRENCE; PATHOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps provide information at MR imaging that may reflect cell attenuation and integrity. We hypothesized that cerebellar tumors in children can be differentiated by their ADC values.
   METHODS: Brain MR imaging studies that included ADC maps were retrospectively reviewed in 32 patients with histologically proved cerebellar neoplasm. There were 17 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (JPA), 8 medulloblastomas, 5 ependymomas, and 2 rhabdoid (atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor [AT/RT]) tumors. Absolute ADC values of contrast-enhancing solid tumor regions and ADC ratios (ADC of solid tumor to ADC of normal-appearing white matter) were compared with the histologic diagnosis. ADC values and ratios of JPAs, medulloblastomas, and ependymomas were compared by using a 2-tailed t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
   RESULTS: ADC values were significantly higher in pilocytic astrocytomas (1.65 +/- 0.27) (mean +/- SD) than in ependymomas (1.10 +/- 0.11) (P = .0003) and medulloblastomas (0.66 +/- 0.15) (P <.0001). Ependymomas demonstrated significantly higher ADC values than medulloblastomas (P =.0005). The observed differences were statistically significant on ANOVA (P <.001). ADC ratios were also significantly different among these 3 tumor types. AT/RT ADC values were similar to medulloblastoma. The range of ADC values and ratios within JPAs and ependymomas did not overlap with that of medulloblastomas.
   CONCLUSION: Assessment of ADC values of enhancing solid tumor is a simple and reliable technique for preoperative differentiation of cerebellar tumors in pediatric patients. Our cutoff values of > 1.4 X 10(3) mm(2)/s for JPA and < 0.9 X 10(3) mm(2)/s for medulloblastoma were 100% specific.

AB Introduction: Investigation into pharmacological and mechanical means of improving recanalization rates by intraarterial therapy has led to technological development. Angiographic recanalization has been associated with improvement in clinical outcome. A clot retriever has recently joined an imperfect armamentarium for intraarterial stroke therapy. In this report, we describe successful recanalization of an acute thrombotic occlusion of the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) achieved with a self-expanding stent. Methods: An 82-year-old woman with a history of coronary atherosclerosis and previous cerebellar hemorrhage presented with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 11. Perfusion computed tomography imaging showed a left MCA territory deficit. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a small punctiform insular hyperintensity. Angiography documented occlusion of the inferior division of the left MCA (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction or Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, TIMI/TICI, grade 0). Intraarterial delivery of eptifibatide to the occlusion site failed to recanalize the vessel. Deployment of a self-expanding stent in the occluded segment resulted in complete revascularization of the distal vascular bed. Results: Angiography performed on the next day confirmed patency of the stented vessel segment (TIMI/TICI 3). The patient was discharged 3 days after the procedure (NIHSS 3). MR angiography obtained 3 months after the procedure documented left MCA patency. Conclusion: This technique may have a role worthy of further investigation in acute stroke therapy.

   FEATURES
AB Introduction: Inherited prion diseases are caused by mutations in the gene which codes for prion protein (PrP), leading to proliferation of abnormal PrP isomers in the brain and neurodegeneration; they include Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD). Methods: We studied two patients with symptomatic inherited prion disease (P102L) and two pre-symptomatic P102L gene carriers using quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Short echo time spectra were acquired from the thalamus, caudate region and frontal white matter, metabolite levels and ratios were measured and z-scores calculated for individual patients relative to age-matched normal controls. MRS data were compared with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Results: One fCJD case had generalised atrophy and showed increased levels of myo-inositol (MI) in the thalamus (z=3.7). The other had decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (z=4) and diffuse signal abnormality in the frontal white matter. Both asymptomatic gene carriers had normal imaging, but increased frontal white matter MI (z=4.3, 4.1), and one also had increased MI in the caudate (z=5.3). Conclusion: Isolated MI abnormalities in asymptomatic gene carriers are a novel finding and may reflect early glial proliferation, prior to significant neuronal damage. MRS provides potential non-invasive surrogate markers of early disease and progression in inherited prion disease.

DT Article
ID MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; WHITE-MATTER; AXONAL LOSS;
   MRI; SEGMENTATION; LESIONS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT) damage was established in multiple sclerosis by histology, MR spectroscopy, magnetization transfer imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, whether this phenomenon can be detected in relapsing neuromyelitis optica (RNMO) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to use DTI to investigate the presence of NABT damage in RNMO patients and its possible mechanism.
   METHODS: Conventional MR imaging and DTI scans were performed in 16 patients with RNMO without visible lesions on brain MR imaging and in 16 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects. Histogram analysis of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed in the entire brain tissue (BT), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM). Region of interest (ROI) analysis of MD and FA was also performed in WM regions connected with the spinal white matter tracts or optic nerve (including medulla oblongata, cerebral peduncle, internal capsule, and optic radiation), in corpus callosum without direct connection with them, and in some GM regions.
   RESULTS: From histogram analysis, we found the RNMO group had a higher average MD of the BT, WM, and GM, a lower average MID peak height and a higher average MD peak location of the GM, and a higher average FA peak height of the WM than did the control group. From ROI analysis, compared with control subjects, RNMO patients had a higher average MD and a lower average FA in ROIs of WM connected with the spinal white matter tracts or optic nerve and a normal average MD and FA in corpus callosum without direct connection with them. In addition, a high average MD was found in parietal G M in these patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the presence of abnormal diffusion in brain tissue in patients with RNMO and suggest that secondary degeneration caused by lesions in the spinal cord and optic nerve might be an important mechanism for this abnormality.

TI A method for clustering white matter fiber tracts
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFUSION; TRACKING; DTI
AB BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite its potential for visualizing white matter fiber tracts in vivo, diffusion tensor tractography has found only limited applications in clinical research in which specific anatomic connections between distant regions need to be evaluated. We introduce a robust method for fiber clustering that guides the separation of anatomically distinct fiber tracts and enables further estimation of anatomic connectivity between distant brain regions.
   METHODS: Line scanning diffusion tenser images (LSDTI) were acquired on a 1.5T magnet. Regions of interest for several anatomically distinct fiber tracts were manually drawn; then, white matter tractography was performed by using the Runge-Kutta method to interpolate paths (fiber traces) following the major directions of diffusion, in which traces were seeded only within the defined regions of interest. Next, a fully automatic procedure was applied to fiber traces, grouping them according to a pairwise similarity function that takes into account the shapes of the fibers and their spatial locations.
   RESULTS: We demonstrated the ability of the clustering algorithm to separate several fiber tracts which are otherwise difficult to define (left and right fornix, uncinate fasciculus and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and corpus callosum fibers).
   CONCLUSION: This method successfully delineates fiber tracts that can be further analyzed for clinical research purposes. Hypotheses regarding specific fiber connections and their abnormalities in various neuropsychiatric disorders can now be tested.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown microbleeds to be a risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke. This study was performed to determine whether combinations of the presence or absence of microbleeds and advanced WMH are risk factors for subsequent recurrent stroke types.
   METHODS: In 266 patients with stroke, microbleeds on T2*-weighted MR images were counted, and WMH on T2-weighted images was graded. Patients were divided into 4 groups by the combinations of the presence or absence of microbleeds and advanced WMH and were followed up for stroke recurrence.
   RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 564.8 +/- 220.5 days, 26 patients developed recurrent strokes, including 10 intracerebral hemorrhages and 16 ischemic strokes. Patients with microbleeds without advanced WMH (n = 42) developed only intracerebral hemorrhages (n = 8), and the recurrence rate of intracerebral hemorrhage in those patients estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was the highest in the 4 groups (14.3% in 1 year and 21.2% in 2 years). In contrast, patients with advanced WMH without microbleeds (n = 39) developed only ischemic strokes (n = 6), and the estimated recurrent rate of ischemic stroke in those patients was the highest in the 4 groups (10.5% in 1 year and 17.4% in 2 years). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that microbleeds were associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio [HR], 85.626; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.344-1155.649) and that advanced WMH was negatively associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 0.016; 95% CI, 0.001-0.258). Advanced WMH was associated with ischemic stroke (HR, 10.659; 95% CI, 2.601-43.678).
   CONCLUSION: It appears that patients at high risk of subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage or ischemic stroke can be identified by combinations of the presence or absence of microbleeds and advanced WMH.

AB INTRODUCTION: Noninvasive measurements of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and contrast transfer coefficient (K-trans) have potential benefits in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of adult glioma. This study examines the relationship between CBV, K-trans, and overall survival.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-seven adult patients with glioma underwent T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, and parametric maps of CBV and K-trans were calculated. The relationship of histologic grade, CBV, K-trans, age, sex, surgical resection, and use of adjuvant therapy to survival were analyzed by using the logrank method and Cox regression analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method for displaying survival curves was used. The relationship of factors such as comorbidity, elevated intracranial pressure, size of nonenhancing tumor, and peritumoral edema were not considered.
   RESULTS: Both CBV (P < .01) and K-trans (P < .01) show a significant relationship to histologic grade. CBV (P = .004), K-trans (p = .008), and histologic grade (P < .001) all demonstrate a significant association with patient survival when analyzed individually. Cox regression analysis identified only histologic grade (P < .01) and K-trans (p < .05) as independent significant prognostic indicators. Examination of survival data from high-grade (III and IV) tumors demonstrated a linear relationship between K-trans and patient survival (P < .01).
   CONCLUSION: This study suggests a direct relationship between K-trans and length of survival in high-grade gliomas, which could be of clinical importance. CBV relates directly to histologic grade but provides no independent prognostic information over and above that provided by grade. Further large prospective studies should be planned to test whether this observation holds true.

AB In recent years, combined diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with perfusion imaging (PI) has become an important investigational tool in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, as it may differentiate reversible from irreversible brain tissue damage. We consecutively examined 20 subjects within 12 h of stroke onset using a multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) examination consisting of DWI, mean transit time (MTT) as PI parameter, and MR angiography (MRA). T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) on day 7 were also acquired in order to obtain final infarct volume. The following MR parameters were considered: volumetric measures of lesion growth and MTT abnormalities, quantification of regional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and visual inspection of MRA findings. Our results showed: (1) an acute DWI lesion was not predictive of lesion growth and the DWI abnormality did not represent the irreversibly infarcted tissue; (2) ADC values in the ischemic penumbra could not predict tissue at risk; (3) the DWI-PI mismatch did not predict lesion growth, and the PI abnormality overestimated the amount of tissue at risk; and (4) patients with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion had greater initial and final infarct volumes. This study did not demonstrate the prognostic value of a multimodal MR approach in early ischemic stroke; MRA alone provided predictive information about the volumetric evolution of the lesion.

TI Diagnosing carotid stenosis near-occlusion by using CT angiography
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC ANGIOGRAPHY; ARTERY STENOSIS; ENDARTERECTOMY;
   DISEASE; DISTAL
AB BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Identification of carotid near-occlusion is essential before calculation of percent stenosis because stroke risk is lower than other severe stenosis and the treatment benefit is less. Calculations with reduced distal diameters are fallacious. CT angiography (CTA) is convenient and accurately quantifies internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis.
   METHODS: In a blinded protocol, 268 carotid artery CTAs for known or suspected carotid disease were independently evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists. All carotid arteries were measured in millimeters at the narrowest diameter of the stenotic bulb, distal ICA well beyond the tapering bulb, and distal external carotid artery (ECA). Near-occlusions were independently identified, with disagreements settled by consensus meeting. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis defined the threshold values that best predicted near-occlusion according to (1) ICA stenosis, (2) distal ICA, (3) distal ICA: contralateral distal ICA, and (4) distal ICA: ECA. Paired permutations of variables were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Forty-two near-occlusion distal ICAs were identified. The ROC-derived threshold values determined near-occlusion carotid stenosis with a sensitivity range, 90.2-97.3; specificity, 84.1-89.9; positive predictive value (PPV), 61.3-66.7; and negative predictive value (NPV), 96.7-99.4. Ranges for paired permutations were also determined: sensitivity, 82.9-91.9; specificity, 95.4-96.8; PPV, 78.685.7; and NPV, 96.3-98.4.
   CONCLUSIONS: Threshold values provide guidelines for CTA interpretation when assessing carotid artery disease and the presence of near-occlusion. Ultimate identification of near-occlusion requires the interpreter's judgment, with attention to the following criteria: (1) notable stenosis of the ICA bulb and (2) distal ICA caliber reduction compared with (A) expected size, (B) contralateral ICA, and (C) ipsilateral ECA. Near-occlusion distal ICAs can be reliably identified on CTA.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The mechanisms by which the glucocorticoid dexamethasone produces its therapeutic action in patients with intracranial tumors still remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dexamethasone affects cerebral perfusion and water molecule diffusion by using quantitative dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MR imaging (DSC-MR imaging) and diffusion tensor MR imaging (DT-MR imaging).
   METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with glioblastoma multiforme underwent DSC-MR imaging and DT-MR imaging before and 48-72 hours after dexamethasone treatment (16 mg/day). Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and water mean diffusivity (< D >) were measured for enhancing tumor, nonenhancing peritumoral edematous brain, and normal-appearing contralateral white matter before and after steroid therapy. The percentage change in CBF, CBV, MTT, and < D > for the 3 tissue types was calculated for each patient, a mean value obtained for the population, and the statistical significance determined by using a paired-samples Student t test.
   RESULTS: After dexamethasone treatment, there was no significant change in tumor CBF, CBV, or MTT. Edematous brain CBV and MTT were also unchanged. There was, however, an increase in edematous brain CBF (11.6%, P=.05). < D > was reduced in both enhancing tumor (-5.8%; P=.001) and edematous brain (-6.0%; P <.001). There was no significant change in CBF, CBV, MTT, or < D > for normal-appearing contralateral white matter after treatment.
   CONCLUSION: These data suggest that dexamethasone does not significantly affect tumor blood flow but may, by reducing peritumoral water content and local tissue pressure, subtly increase perfusion in the edematous brain.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In Alzheimer disease (AD), elevated brain iron concentrations in gray matter suggest a disruption in iron homeostasis, while demyelination processes in white matter increase the water content. Our aim was to assess whether the transverse proton relaxation rate, or R-2, an MR imaging parameter affected by changes in brain iron concentration and water content, was different in elderly participants with mild to severe levels of cognitive impairment compared with healthy controls.
   METHODS: Twelve elderly participants reporting memory problems and 11 healthy volunteers underwent single-spin-echo MR imaging in a 1.5T scanner, with subsequent neuropsychological testing. R-2 data were collected from 14 brain regions in cortical and subcortical gray and white matter. Those with memory complaints were separated into 2 further subgroups: MC1 (no objective cognitive impairment) and MC2 (mild to severe objective cognitive impairment).
   RESULTS: Mean brain R-2 values from the 11 controls correlated strongly (r = 0.94, P < .0001) with reference brain iron concentrations for healthy adults. R-2 values in the MC1 and MC2 subgroups were significantly higher in the right temporal cortex and significantly lower in the left internal capsule, compared with healthy controls. R-2 values in the MC2 subgroup were significantly lower in the left temporal and frontal white matter, compared with healthy controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: R-2 differences between both subgroups and the healthy controls suggest iron has increased in the temporal cortex, and myelin has been lost from several white matter regions in those with memory complaints, consistent with incipient AD pathogenesis and biochemical data.

AB The purpose of our study was to identify the perfusion MRI (pMRI) algorithm which yields a volume of hypoperfused tissue that best correlates with the acute clinical deficit as quantified by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and therefore reflects critically hypoperfused tissue. A group of 20 patients with a first acute stroke and stroke MRI within 24 h of symptom onset were retrospectively analyzed. Perfusion maps were derived using four different algorithms to estimate relative mean transit time (rMTT): (1) cerebral blood flow (CBF) arterial input function (AIF)/singular voxel decomposition (SVD); (2) area peak; (3) time to peak (TTP); and (4) first moment method. Lesion volumes based on five different MTT thresholds relative to contralateral brain were compared with each other and correlated with NIHSS score. The first moment method had the highest correlation with NIHSS (r=0.79, P < 0.001) followed by the AIF/SVD method, both of which did not differ significantly from each other with regard to lesion volumes. TTP and area peak derived both volumes, which correlated poorly or only moderately with NIHSS scores. Data from our pilot study suggest that the first moment and the AIF/SVD method have advantages over the other algorithms in identifying the pMRI lesion volume that best reflects clinical severity. At present there seems to be no need for extensive postprocessing and arbitrarily defined delay thresholds in pMRI as the simple qualitative approach with a first moment algorithm is equally accurate. Larger sample sizes which allow comparison between imaging and clinical outcomes are needed to refine the choice of best perfusion parameter in pMRI.

AB Background and Purpose: Primary angiitis of the central nervous system of childhood (cPACNS) is a rare and ill-defined disease. In the absence of a brain biopsy, the diagnosis is based on typical clinical and imaging abnormalities. The aim of this study was to analyze systematically the MR imaging and MR angiographic (MRA) abnormalities in a large cohort of children with cPACNS.
   Methods: We analyzed the MR imaging features of a single pediatric center cohort of 45 cPACNS patients. MR imaging studies were performed for all patients, and both MR imaging and MRA were performed for 42 patients, who formed the cohort for review of the presence and correlation of lesions. Proportions were calculated by using the Fisher exact test, and agreement between MR imaging and MRA was calculated by using the McNemar test. The sensitivity of each diagnostic technique was established.
   Results: The most-common pattern of parenchymal abnormality was multifocal, unilateral involvement, each in 42/45 patients (93%). The lateral lenticulostriate artery terrritory was affected in 56% of cases, with involvement of a supratentorial deep gray matter structure in 91%. No infratentorial lesion occurred in the absence of supratentorial abnormality. MRA was normal in 12/42 patients (28.6%). Among the abnormal studies, stenosis was detected on MRA in 83% and was "benign" in appearance in 73% of patients and "aggressive" in 16.7%. Involvement was proximal in 83% and distal in 27% of patients. Multiple ipsilateral lesions were seen in 63%. MR imaging was abnormal in every patient where MRA was abnormal. With the assumption of MR imaging as the gold standard, the sensitivity of MRA was 72%. The agreement between MR imaging and MRA for abnormality was significant (P=.04).
   Conclusion: We have illustrated the MR imaging and MRA appearances of cPACNS in the largest cohort to date. Both parenchymal and vascular lesions were predominantly proximal, unilateral, and multifocal within the anterior circulation. There was good agreement between MR imaging and MRA for lesion location. MR imaging findings were abnormal in all cases at diagnosis, and this remains the most sensitive technique to the detection of vasculitis.

AB Dissection of cervical arteries causes ischemic stroke in young adults. This reports the clinical, ultrasonographic, and neuroradiological findings in 24 patients with 28 vertebral artery dissections in the neck (4 occurring bilaterally). In 20 patients (83%), the dissection was temporally related to trauma. No patients had an underlying vascular disease, for example, atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. In all, the major initial manifestation was pain in the occipital or neck region. The next most common symptoms were vertigo and nausea (in 17 patients). Clinical manifestations were vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack (TIA) (5 patients: in 2 patients vestibulocerebellar TIA, in 1 patient visual TIA, in 1 patient motor TIA, and in 1 patient brain stem TIA with perioral paresthesia), cerebellar infarction (10 patients, in 4 patients bilateral), brainstem infarction (5 patients), posterior cerebral artery territory infarction (1 patient), and multiple vertebrobasilar ischemic lesions Q patients). Typical angiographic findings were irregular narrowing of the vessel lumen or a tapering stenosis with distal occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a thickened vessel wall with hematoma signal at the site of the dissection. Duplex color-flow imaging was valuable for the early diagnosis of extracranial vertebral artery dissection and for follow-up examinations. The distal V1 - and the proximal V2-segment (at the level of C6 vertebra) was the most frequent localization of dissections (in 43%). The outcome was favorable except for 2 patients with basilar artery occlusion. Embolism to the basilar artery may be avoided by early administration of anticoagulants.

AB Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, systemic disease caused by monoclonal expansion of dendritic cells that shows a particular predilection for the hypothalamic-pituitary system (HPS). We studied the function (anterior and posterior pituitary hormonal secretion) and morphology using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the HPS in 17 adult patients (seven males, median age 35 years, range 18-59 years) with multisystem LCH. We also evaluated the evolution of structural HPS abnormalities in relation to pituitary function and response to treatment in 12 of these patients during a median follow-up period of 3.75 years (range 1.5-10 years). Of the 17 patients, 14 (82%) had abnormal HPS imaging, and 12 (70%) had more than one area involved. Lack of the bright spot of the posterior pituitary lobe was typically found in all patients with the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI). Eight patients (47%) had infundibular enlargement, six (35%) pituitary infiltration, four (24%) partially or completely empty sella, three (18%) hypothalamic involvement, and two (12%) infundibular atrophy. DI was found in 16 patients (94%) and anterior pituitary hormonal deficiency (APHD) in 10 patients (59%); two patients had single (12%) and 8 (47%) multiple APHD. During the follow-up period there was improvement of the initially demonstrated HPS pathology in seven (47%) patients, and five (33%) of them had received at least one form of treatment. APHD and DI persisted in all patients except in one in whom established gonadotrophin deficiency recovered. In summary, DI and APHD are very common in patients with multisystem LCH and are almost always associated with abnormal HPS imaging.

AB We describe two patients with symptomatic vasospasms after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who were successfully treated with intraarterial injection of colforsin daropate hydrochloride (HCl). Colforsin daropate HCl is capable of directly stimulating adenylate cyclase, which in turn causes vasorelaxation via elevated intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. We suggest that colforsin daropate HCl might be a useful therapeutic tool in treating cerebral vasospasm.

AB The pathogenesis of intracranial arterial aneurysms (AA) remains unclear, despite their clinical importance. An improved understanding of this disease is important in choosing therapeutic options. In addition to the "classical" berry-type aneurysm, there are various other types of intracranial AA such as infectious, dissecting or giant, partially-thrombosed aneurysms. From the clinician's perspective, the hypothesis that some of these intracranial AA might be due to abluminal factors has been proposed for several years. Indeed, this hypothesis and the empirical use of anti-inflammatory drugs in giant intracranial aneurysms have been confirmed by recent studies reporting that an enzyme involved in the inflammatory cascade (5-lipoxygenase or 5-LO) promotes the pathogenesis of specific aneurysms in humans. 5-LO generates different forms of leukotrienes which are potent mediators of inflammation. Adventitial inflammation leads to a weakening of the media from the abluminal part of the vessel wall due to the release of proinflammatory factors that invade the media, thereby degrading the extracellular matrix, the elastic lamina of the vascular wall, and, finally, the integrity of the vessel lumen. This in turn results in a dilation of the vessel and aneurysm formation. Moreover, neoangiogenesis of vasa vasorum is found in close proximity to 5-LO activated macrophages. In addition to this biological cascade, we argue that repeated subadventitial haemorrhages from the new vasa vasorum play an important role in aneurysm pathogenesis, due to a progressive increase in size mediated by the apposition of new layers of intramural haematoma within the vessel wall. Intracranial giant AA can therefore be regarded as a proliferative disease of the vessel wall induced by extravascular activity. Considering certain aneurysmal vasculopathies as an abluminal disease might alter current therapeutic strategies. Therapy should not only be aimed at the intraluminal repair of the artery, but also cross the vessel wall to reach the vasa vasorum. Drug-eluting stents placed proximal to the lesion and targeted to the origin of the vasa vasorum could be considered as a potential future option. "Intelligent" MRI contrast agents (i.e., macrophage marking) could be used to detect vasa vasorum proliferation and weakening of the vessel wall in vivo.

AB We evaluated prospectively the relation between packing and reopening in coiled intracranial aneurysms. Packing, defined as the ratio between the volume of inserted coils and volume of the aneurysm expressed as percentage, was calculated for 82 intracranial aneurysms treated with detachable coils. Aneurysm volume was assessed from 3D angiography. Reopening of the aneurysmal lumen at the 6-monthfollow-up angiography was dichotomized into present or absent. We assessed whether packing above 24% protected against reopening. Twenty-three of 82 aneurysms (28%) showed reopening. Reopening was caused by compaction in 20 aneurysms and by partial thrombosis, undetected at the time of initial treatment in three aneurysms. Three of 29 aneurysms (10%) with a packing of more than 24% showed reopening. These three aneurysms contained partially intraluminal thrombosis undetected at the time of treatment. We conclude that in coiled intracranial aneurysms packing above 24% protects against reopening by compaction in non-thrombosed aneurysms. Since intraluminal thrombosis may go undetected at the time of treatment, follow-up angiography is still warranted in aneurysms with packing densities greater than 24%.

   IDENTIFICATION; PROGNOSIS; NECROSIS; FEATURES; OUTCOMES; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For patients with malignant gliomas, clinical data-including age, perioperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and tumor resection-and tumor imaging features-including necrosis and edema-have been found to correlate with survival. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of these results and determine whether other imaging features are useful in predicting survival.
   METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between 15 imaging variables obtained from contrast-enhanced MR imaging scans and survival in patients with grade III (n = 43) and grade IV (n = 110) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) gliomas. Image analysis was performed by 2 neuroradiologists who were blinded to clinical data. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival probabilities. Univariable Cox models were used to assess the impact of imaging features on survival. A recursive partitioning analysis also was performed.
   RESULTS. As expected, age and KPS scores had significant prognostic value for both tumor grades. The extent of resection was not a statistically meaningful predictor of survival. For GBM, univariable analysis revealed the following imaging features to be significant, (hazard ratios in parentheses): noncontrast-enhancing tumor (nCET, 0.55), edema (1.62), satellites (1.74), and multifocality (4.34). For grade III tumors, the Cox hazard ratio for necrosis was 4.43 (P = .014) and correlated with a poor outcome and survival rates comparable to GBM patients. Lack of nCET, multifocality, and satellite lesions also were correlated with shortened survival.
   CONCLUSION: Of 15 tumor imaging features in GBM patients, only nCET, edema, and multifocality/satellites are statistically significant prognostic indicators. The survival advantage of nCET is a novel finding.

TI Structural, immunocytochemical, and MR imaging properties of
   periventricular crossroads of growing cortical pathways in preterm
   infants

   PATTERNS; FEATURES; MARKERS; MONKEY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Periventricular white matter (WM) areas are widely recognized as predilection sites for complex cellular damage after ischemia/reperfusion or inflammatory injury of the perinatal cerebrum. We analyzed histochemical and MR imaging properties of fiber architectonics and extracellular matrix (ECM) of periventricular areas to disclose the potential significance of topographically specific WM lesions for the neurodevelopmental outcome.
   METHODS: We combined histochemical methods for demonstration of fibers, axonal guidance molecules, and ECM with T1-weighted MR images on postmortem specimens aged 15 to 36 postovulatory weeks (POW) and T2-weighted MR images on in vivo fetuses aged 14 to 26 POW.
   RESULTS: The fiber architectonics of the fetal cerebrum display tangential axon strata in frontopolar and occipitopolar regions, whereas the central periventricular region contains crossroads of intersecting callosal (transverse), associative (sagittal), and thalamocortical/ corticofugal (radial) fiber bundles. In early preterms, crossroads contain hydrophylic ECM with axonal guidance molecules, and they are easily recognized as hypointensities on T1-weighted MR images or hyperintensities on T2-weighted MR images. After the 28 POW, tangential fetal fiber-architectonic stratification transforms into the corona radiata system; however, the growth of cortical pathways continues in crossroad areas, as indicated by the presence of ECM and their distinct MR imaging signal intensities.
   CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of MR imaging with histochemical findings demonstrated the presence of periventricular fiber crossroads rich in ECM and axonal guidance molecules. We propose that, in perinatal WM lesions, periventricular WM crossroads represent a hitherto unrecognized and vulnerable cellular and topographic target in which combined damage of association-commissural and projection fibers may explain the complexity of cognitive, sensory, and motor deficit in survivors of periventricular WM lesions.

AB A quantitative description of white matter fiber attenuation, the fiber density index (FDi) is described. This measure is derived from quantitative analysis of diffusion tensor imaging and reveals an index of the number of fiber paths traversing a region of interest. In this report, FDi is computed in 10 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, in white matter that is peritumoral and contralateral. FDi is shown to correlate significantly with fractional anisotropy.

AB Increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) limits the general use of thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This study shows that early blood-brain barrier defects in AIS can be assessed by using permeability MR imaging. Significantly increased permeability was found in 3 patients who later hemorrhaged. This method indicates the potential for identifying patients at higher risk of HT and offers the use of physiologic imaging rather than time from onset of symptoms to guide treatment decisions.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid angioplasty and stent placement may be the preferred treatment in patients with carotid dissection who have failed medical management. The goal of this study was to determine the procedural feasibility and safety as well as long-term complication rates of carotid angioplasty and stent placement in a consecutive cohort of relatively young, high-surgical-risk patients.
   PATIENTS AND TECHNIQUES: A series of 26 consecutive patients (mean age, 49 years; 15 men and 11 women) who underwent angioplasty and stent placement for carotid dissection with or without pseudoaneurysm from April 1997 to April 2005 at our institution (9 traumatic, 8 spontaneous, and 9 iatrogenic) was retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-eight stents were used in 29 procedures performed on 27 vessels (20 internal carotid arteries and 7 common carotid arteries). Patients were followed with cerebral angiography, CT, sonography, or clinically for a mean of 14.6 months (range, 5 days to 48.2 months) with 17 of 26 patients having at least 6 months of follow-up. Procedural and long-term complication rates were calculated.
   RESULTS: Dissection-induced stenosis was reduced from 71 +/- 18% to no significant stenosis in 20 of the 21 patients with measurable stenosis. The procedural transient ischemic attack (TIA) rate was 3 of 29 procedures (10.3%). There were no procedural strokes. One patient required angioplasty of a common femoral artery. One procedure was terminated when an asymptomatic new intimal flap was created before intervention. Two patients had occlusions of the treated vessel noted at 22 days (presented with contralateral stroke) and 3.4 months (asymptomatic). There were 2 unrelated deaths from myocardial infarction at 8 days and 15.2 months. Two patients had recurrent ipsilateral TIA at 2.7 months and 12 months. The 30-day occlusion and death rate was 2 of 29 procedures (6.9%).
   CONCLUSION. In this series, angioplasty and stent placement were effective in relieving stenosis secondary to carotid dissection with or without pseudoaneurysm and have low rates of ischemic complications.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the outcome of postprocedural cerebral diffusion-weighted (DW) MR lesions after carotid artery stent placement (CAS) and the incidence of new cerebral MR lesions 6 months after the procedure.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DW and T2-weighted MR imaging of the brain and neurologic examinations were performed in 105 patients before and 24 hours and 6 months after CAS. In addition, a selective control angiography of the treated artery was performed after 6 months.
   RESULTS: In 22 (21%) of 105 patients, DW MR images 24 hours after CAS showed 64 new neurologically silent lesions; 2 (3.1%) of these 64 lesions were also visible in T2-weighted MR images. The latter ones were still visible after 6 months. In the remaining 62 lesions, there were no abnormalities visible in DW and T2-weighted imaging at follow-up. In 2 (1.9%) of the 105 patients, new cerebral lesions were seen in T2-weighted images after 6 months; one patient was neurologically symptomatic. All others patients were neurologically unremarkable at 6-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most postprocedural DW lesions showed no manifestations at 6-month MR follow-up and were clinically silent. This indicates that these lesions are potentially reversible and of no major neurologic sequelae. In addition, follow-up 6 months after CAS showed a very low incidence of new cerebral lesions and neurologic events.

   GIANT
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although stent-assisted intracranial procedures are becoming a routine clinical practice, there have been relatively few large studies published in the literature regarding the application of the balloon-expandable stent technology in the treatment of intracranial arterial diseases. In this report, the authors reviewed their experience with 75 cases at a single center.
   METHODS: From 1998 to 2003, 75 patients underwent percutaneous transluminal intracranial stent placement as a treatment for wide-necked intracranial aneurysms and atherosclerotic stenoses. The anatomy of the target lesions, technical details of the procedures, device functionality, procedure-related complications, and short-term outcomes were reviewed in a retrospective fashion.
   RESULTS: The clinical indications included wide-necked intracranial aneurysms (59) and atherosclerotic stenoses (16). The stent was successfully deployed in 92% of the patients (69 of 75 cases). In the remaining 6 cases, the causes of failed stent deployment included arterial tortuosities (2), stent migration (2), fracture of the stent (1), and arterial perforation (1). The short-term outcome, (mean follow-up, 7.5 months; range, 3-12 months) was evaluated by using the modified Rankin scale (MR spectroscopy 0-6). Fifty-three patients (70.6%) had excellent outcomes (MR spectroscopy 0-1), 12 (16%) had good outcomes (MR spectroscopy 2), and 5 (6.7%) had poor outcomes (MR spectroscopy 4-5). Five patients (6.7%) died.
   CONCLUSION. The use of BES is associated with a high rate of hemorrhagic and ischemic complications, more specifically when used in the anterior circulation. Cases of large-necked aneurysms not treatable with balloon remodeling technique and atheromatous sclerosis could be eligible for this treatment.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate endovascular treatment of wide-necked aneurysms of the internal carotid artery with the liquid embolic agent Onyx HD 500.
   METHODS: Twenty-two wide-necked, large or giant aneurysms of the internal carotid artery (ICA) were treated in 22 patients with Onyx HD 500 (15 ophthalmic, 1 clinoid, and 6 cavernous aneurysms). Sixteen patients were asymptomatic, and mass effect of the aneuryms caused cranial nerve palsy in 6. Seven aneurysms showed regrowth after prior endovascular coiling.
   RESULTS: Postinterventional angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 18 aneurysms, and a small remnant was left in 4. Clinical and angiographic follow-up data are available in 19 patients (average follow-up, 13 months; range, 5-36 months). Total occlusion was demonstrated in 17 aneurysms (91%), and a partial recanalization was seen in 2. There were 2 ICA occlusions and 1 ICA stenosis. Clinical follow-up demonstrated a transient ischemic attack in 1 patient; 2 with cranial nerve palsy were unchanged, and 2 showed improved symptoms compared with the findings before treatment. The remaining 14 patients were clinically asymptomatic. There was no permanent severe morbidity and no mortality at follow-up.
   CONCLUSION. The endovascular treatment of wide-necked, large or giant ICA aneurysms with Onyx HD 500 is a treatment option in these selected cases. The benefit is a primary high and stable occlusion rate and good clinical outcome. ICA occlusion caused by Onyx migration in the parent artery is a typical problem, with a benign clinical course in this series.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysm recanalization is an innate problem in endovascular treatment of aneurysms with coils. A coated coil system, covered with a bioabsorbable polymeric material (polyglycolic acid/lactide copolymer, PGLA), was developed to accelerate intra-aneurysmal clot organization and fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PGLA-coated coils in patients with intracranial aneurysms and to compare the outcome with that of bare platinum coils.
   PATIENTS AND TECHNIQUES: Fifty-one patients harboring 56 intracranial aneurysms underwent endovascular embolization with the PGLA-coated coils. In the control group were 78 consecutive patients, harboring 87 aneurysms, who underwent coil embolization with bare platinum coils. The authors compared coil volume, packing attenuation, degree of occlusion of aneurysms, procedure-related complications, and follow-up results between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: The PGLA-coil group showed comparable data regarding rate of total or near-total occlusion of the aneurysm, incidence procedure-related thromboembolism, and management outcome. Mean coil volume deployed and packing attenuation of the PGLA-coil group were significantly higher than those of the bare-coil group (P = .0026 and P <.0001, respectively). Radiologic follow-up evaluation revealed recanalization in 14 of 39 aneurysms (major recanalization in 5 [13%] and minor recanalization in 9 [23%]) among the PGLA-coil group and in 29 of 64 aneurysms (major recanalization in 9 [14%] and minor recanalization in 20 [31%]) among the bare-coil group.
   CONCLUSION. In this study, the incidence of recanalization was not different in aneurysms treated with PGLA-coated coils compared with historical controls treated with bare platinum coils.

ID HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHY; MR FINDINGS; EDEMA
AB Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is caused by various heterogeneous factors, the commonest being hypertension, followed by nonhypertensive causes such as eclampsia, renal diseases and immunosuppressive therapy. Patients with RPLS exhibit bilateral white and gray matter abnormalities in the posterior aspects of the cerebral hemispheres. However, this syndrome may affect the brainstem predominantly, and these cases are designated as hypertensive brainstem encephalopathy. We present here two patients with reversible brainstem encephalopathy: one with hypertension and the other without hypertension. These patients presented with swelling and diffuse hyperintensities of the brainstem in fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted MRI, but with relatively mild clinical symptoms. They recovered without major neurological deficits, but had residual lacunar lesions in the pons. Reversible brainstem encephalopathy with characteristic MRI features was found in both hypertensive and nonhypertensive patients. These patients were diagnosed with a brainstem variant of RPLS, which is potentially fully reversible after an adequate treatment, and therefore should be carefully differentiated from other brainstem disease conditions.

AB Recent advancements in endovascular aneurysm repair, including bioactive and expansile coils and intracranial stents, hold promise for improved aneurysm occlusion rates. We report the immediate and midterm clinical and angiographic outcomes of a consecutive series of patients treated since the advent of these technologies. Clinical and radiological records of 134 patients with 142 aneurysms treated between 2001 and 2004 were retrospectively evaluated by an independent neurologist. Endovascular procedures were analyzed by an independent neuroradiologist blinded to all clinical information. Seventy-two ruptured and 60 un-ruptured saccular aneurysms, nine fusiform and one post-traumatic aneurysm were treated. Matrix coils were used in 53% of saccular aneurysms and HydroCoils in 13% of all aneurysms. Neuroform stents were deployed in 19% of aneurysms. Angiographic total or subtotal occlusion was achieved in 76% of cases and in 96% at last follow-up. Aneurysm recanalization was observed in 14% over a mean follow-up of 12 months, and 18% of aneurysms were retreated. Clinically relevant complications occurred in 6.0%, resulting in procedure-related morbidity of 0.6% and 0.6% mortality at 6 months. No aneurysm bled over a cumulative 1,347 months of observation. Newer embolization technologies can be exploited successfully even in more complex aneurysms with very low morbidity and mortality.

TI Percutaneous vertebroplasty for metastatic involvement of the axis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSORAL APPROACH; MANAGEMENT; PERCENTAGE; C2
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty in the upper cervical spine is a challenging procedure, and little is known about its therapeutic outcome. The purpose of this study was to assess the risks and benefits of percutaneous vertebroplasty for metastatic involvement of the axis.
   METHODS: From January 1994 to August 2004, 12 patients (mean age, 52.3 years) underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty via an anterolateral approach using fluoroscopic guidance for metastatic lesions involving the C2 vertebral body; pain intensity was scored on a scale ranging from 0.0 (no pain) to 10.0 (maximum pain intensity). Eight patients (66.7%) were followed up (mean, 6.9 months); 5 of them had percutaneous vertebroplasty indicated for pain control and spine stabilization and 3, for spine stabilization only.
   RESULTS: The mean volume of cement injected was 2.9 +/- 0.7 mL (range, 2.0-4.0 mL) with a mean vertebral filling of 60.7 +/- 14.6% (range, 25-80%). Cement leakage was detected in 7 treated vertebrae (58.3%). Pain improvement was achieved in 4/5 patients (80%). Spine stability was observed in 7 patients (87.5%), but 1 patient (12.5%) presented with a secondary spine deformity in association with partial vertebral filling. Two postprocedural clinical manifestations (16.7%) were observed: 1 patient (8.3%) had a transient occipital neuralgia and another (8.3%) had an ischemic stroke. Mortality and morbidity rates at mean follow-up were 0.0% and 12.5% (1 patient), respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty of C2 metastases by an antero-lateral approach is an effective option in the treatment strategy of patients with metastases to C2. Nevertheless, it is a challenging procedure and may carry regional and even intracranial risks due to the proximity to the vertebral artery.

   TREATMENT; DETACHABLE COILS; INTERVENTION; EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of early rebleeding after coiling of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, assess the clinical outcome, and identify risk factors for this event.
   METHODS: Early rebleedings occurred in 6/431 (1.4%) consecutive patients after coiling of a ruptured aneurysm. Clinical condition at the time of treatment, aneurysm location and size, initial aneurysm occlusion, timing of coiling, and the presence of an adjacent intracerebral hematoma in the six patients with,early rebleedings were compared with the remaining 425 patients.
   RESULTS: Incidence of early rebleeding after coiling of a ruptured aneurysm was 1.4%, and mortality was 100%. Independent risk factors are the presence of an adjacent intracerebral hematoma and small aneurysm size. Dependant risk factors are location on the anterior communicating artery, initial incomplete aneurysm occlusion, and poor clinical condition at the time of treatment.
   CONCLUSION: Early rebleeding after coiling of ruptured aneurysms is a major concern, in particular because the mortality is very high. A more restricted postembolization anticoagulation strategy in high-risk aneurysms may possibly prevent the occurrence of this devastating event.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study examines whether anatomic extent of pial collateral formation documented on angiography during acute thromboembolic stroke predicts clinical outcome and infarct volume following intra-arterial thrombolysis, compared with other predictive factors.
   METHODS: Angiograms, CT scans, and clinical information were retrospectively reviewed in 65 consecutive patients who underwent thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke. Clinical data included age, sex, time to treatment, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on presentation of symptoms, NIHSS score at the time of hospital discharge, and modified Rankin scale score at time of hospital discharge. Site of occlusion, scoring of anatomic extent of pial collaterals before thrombolysis, and recanalization (complete, partial, or no recanalization) were determined on angiography. Infarct volume was measured on CT scans performed 24-48 hours after treatment.
   RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (82%) qualified for review. Both infarct volume and discharge modified Rankin scale scores were significantly lower for patients with better pial collateral scores than those with worse pial collateral scores, regardless of whether they had complete (P < .0001) or partial (P = .0095) recanalization. Adjusting for other factors, regression analysis models indicate that the infarct volume was significantly larger (P < .0001) and modified discharge Rankin scale score and discharge NIHSS score significantly higher for patients with worse pial collateral scores. Similarly, adjusting for other factors, the infarct volume was significantly lower (P = .0006) for patients with complete recanalization than patients with partial or no recanalization.
   CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of pial collateral formation before thrombolytic treatment can predict infarct volume and clinical outcome for patients with acute stroke undergoing thrombolysis independent of other predictive factors. Thrombolytic treatment appears to have a greater clinical impact in those patients with better pial collateral formation.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed relatively symmetrical, subcortical, white matter abnormalities, predominantly affecting the occipital, posterior temporal and parietal lobes and the cerebellum. T2-dependent abnormalities and elevated regional apparent diffusion coefficient were present in a pattern typical for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The clinical and radiological manifestations were resolved completely with supportive therapy. This case of PRES may be a late complication of gemcitabine or cisplatin therapy precipitated by a general anaesthetic, or associated electrolyte or blood pressure disturbance.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the follow-up of intracranial aneurysms treated with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs). From January 1998 to January 2002 27 MRA and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) examinations were analyzed for residual aneurysms and arterial patency following GDC placement. A total number of 33 intracranial aneurysms was analyzed, including 18 located in the posterior circulation. The MRA analysis was based on source images in combination with maximum intensity projections. The IADSA was used as the reference standard. Two aneurysms were excluded from evaluation, because of susceptibility artefacts from other aneurysms, which were clipped. Sensitivity and positive predictive values of MRA in revealing residual aneurysms were, respectively, 89% and 80%. Specificity in ruling out remnant necks and residual flow around coils was, respectively, 91% and 97%, with a negative predictive value of, respectively, 95% and 100%. Specificity and negative predictive value of MRA for arterial occlusion were, respectively, 87% and 100% for the parent arteries and, respectively, 85% and 100% for the adjacent arteries. MRA is a reliable diagnostic tool in the follow-up of GDC treatment, and it may replace IADSA in excluding residual flow around coils and aneurysmal necks and in ruling out arterial occlusion.

AB Patients with supratentorial high-grade glioma underwent surgery within a vertically open 0.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) system to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative MR guidance in achieving gross-total resection. For 31 patients, preoperative clinical data and MR findings were consistent with the putative diagnosis of a high-grade glioma, in 23 cases in eloquent regions. Tumor resections were carried out within a 0.5-T MR SIGNA SP/i (GE Medical Systems, USA). The resection of the lesion was carried out using fully MR compatible neurosurgical equipment and was stopped at the point when the operation was considered complete by the surgeon viewing the operation field with the microscope. We repeated imaging to determine the residual tumor volume only visible with MRI. Areas of tissue that were abnormal on these images were localized in the bed of resection by using interactive MR guidance. The procedure of resection, imaging control and interactive image guidance was repeated where necessary. Almost all tissue with abnormal characteristics was resected, with the exception of tissue localized in eloquent brain areas. The diagnosis of glioblastoma was confirmed in all 31 cases. When comparing the tumor volume before resection and at the point where the neurosurgeon would otherwise have terminated surgery ("first control"), residual tumor tissue was detectable in 29/31 patients; the mean residual tumor volume was 30.7 +/- 24%. After repeated resections under interactive image guidance the mean residual tumor volume was 15.1%. At this step we found tumor remnants only in 20/31 patients. The perioperative morbidity (12.9%) was low. Twenty-seven patients underwent sufficient postoperative radiotherapy. We found a significant difference (log(rank)p=0.0037) in the mean survival times of the two groups with complete resection (n=10, median survival time 537 days) and incomplete resection (n=17, median survival time 237 days). The resection of primary glioblastoma multiforme under intraoperative MR guidance as demonstrated is a possibility to achieve a more complete removal of the tumor than with conventional techniques. In our small but homogeneous patient group we found an increase in the median survival time in patients with MRI for complete tumor resection, and the overall surgical morbidity was low.

AB The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a key role in cognition, motor function, and emotion processing. However, little is known about how traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects the ACC system. Our purpose was to compare, by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the patterns of cortical activation in patients with cognitive impairment after TBI and those of normal subjects. Cortical activation maps of 11 right-handed healthy control subjects and five TBI patients with cognitive impairment were recorded in response to a Stroop task during a block-designed fMRI experiment. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) was used for individual subjects and group analysis. In TBI patients and controls, cortical activation, found in similar regions of the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes, resembled patterns of activation documented in previous neuroimaging studies of the Stroop task in healthy controls. However, the TBI patients showed a relative decrease in ACC activity compared with the controls. Cognitive impairment in TBI patients seems to be associated with alterations in functional cerebral activity, especially less activation of the ACC. These changes are probably the result of destruction of neural networks after diffuse axonal injury and may reflect cortical disinhibition attributable to disconnection or compensation for an inefficient cognitive process.

TI Diffusion-weighted imaging of radiation-induced brain injury for
   differentiation from tumor recurrence

LA English
DT Article
ID GRADE CEREBRAL GLIOMAS; SIGNAL INTENSITY; FOLLOW-UP; ABSCESS; NECROSIS;
   MRI; DISCRIMINATION; RADIONECROSIS; COEFFICIENTS; PERFUSION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiation between tumor recurrence and treatment-related brain injury is often difficult with conventional MRI. We hypothesized that the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could help differentiate these 2 conditions, because water diffusion may be greater for necrotic tissues in the treatment-related brain injury than for tumor tissues in recurrence. Our aim was to analyze whether DWI findings of recurrent tumor are distinct from those of radiation necrosis.
   METHODS: Seventeen patients were examined prospectively. Two readers assessed the images by consensus for homogeneity and signal intensity of the lesions. Five regions of interest were drawn within the lesions on trace DWI images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The minimal, maximal, and mean values of each lesion were compared between the 2 groups. Findings in 12 of 17 patients were verified histologically by surgery or biopsy; the diagnoses in the remaining 5 patients were made on the basis of follow-up MRI findings and clinical follow-up.
   RESULTS: There were a total of 20 lesions; 12 lesions were due to radiation necrosis and 8 lesions to tumor recurrence. In the radiation necrosis group, 8 lesions had marked hypointensity. In the recurrence group, however, no marked hypointensity was seen. The maximal ADC values within each lesion were significantly smaller for the recurrence group than for the necrosis group (P = .039).
   CONCLUSION. Radiation necrosis usually showed heterogeneity on DWI images and often included spotty, marked hypointensity. Significant difference was found in the maximal ADC values between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence. DWI was useful in differentiating recurrent neoplasm from radiation necrosis.

   MECHANISMS; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reports about steroids and oxygen-ozone therapy to treat lower back pain have been increasing. The purpose of our study was to compare the clinical outcomes in patients treated with infiltrations of O-2-O-3 gas or steroids at short-, medium-, and long-term follow-up.
   METHODS: A total of 306 patients (166 with primarily disk disease, 140 with nondisk vertebral disease) with acute or chronic low back and sciatic nerve pain received a CT-guided intraforaminal infiltration of an O-2-O-3 gas mixture or an periradicular infiltration of steroids. Neurologists unaware of the type of treatment assessed the patients.
   RESULTS: At 1-week follow-up, most patients had a complete remission of pain, regardless of the treatment. At 6-month follow-up, differences in favor of O-2-O-3 treatment were significant in patients with disk disease (P = .0021) but not in those without disk disease (P = .0992). Clinical outcomes were poor in 13 (15.1%) of 86 patients receiving O-2-O-3 infiltration and in 18 (22.5%) of 80 patients receiving steroid injection (P = .2226). Among patients without disk disease, six (8.6%) of 70 patients receiving O-2-O-3 infiltration but 21.4% of the patients receiving steroid injections had poor outcomes (P = .0332).
   CONCLUSION. Oxygen-ozone treatment was highly effective in relieving acute and chronic lower back pain and sciatica. The gas mixture can be administered as a first treatment to replace epidural steroids.

TI Prediction of hemorrhagic transformation in acute ischemic stroke: Role

   THERAPY; RISK
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging may help in predicting hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in acute ischemic stroke. Our purpose was to determine whether the lesion volumes on diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, and early parenchymal enhancement are predictive of HT and to investigate the mechanism of the enhancement.
   METHODS: We retrospectively examined 55 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging within 6 hours of symptom onset and follow-up CT or MR imaging within 72 hours. Intravenous thrombolysis was performed in 15 patients. DW imaging lesion volumes and ADC values were compared between patients with and those without HT. ADCs and perfusion parameters were compared between lesions with and those without parenchymal enhancement.
   RESULTS: Nineteen (34.5%) patients had HT (14 with hemorrhagic infarction, five with parenchymal hematoma). Patients with HT had decreased mean ADCs and large lesion volumes on DW imaging, but differences were not significant (P > .05). HT occurred in five patients (100%) with parenchymal enhancement, which corresponded to the site of HT. In enhancing lesions, the ADC ratio (0.76 +/- 0.06) was slightly higher and the delay in time to peak (0.10 +/- 2.79) was less than respective values in the rest of the ischemic lesion (0.66 +/- 0.06 and 8.79 +/- 4.86, respectively; P = .068).
   CONCLUSION. Early parenchymal enhancement is highly specific for HT and may be associated with early reperfusion and damage to the blood-brain barrier in ischemic tissue. DW imaging lesion volumes and ADC values had no strong relationship with HT.

   EVOLUTION; FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is known that intracranial mass lesions are relatively isotropic on diffusion-weighted imaging. The purpose of this study is to report an unusually high fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (D-av) in the cavity of the brain abscess compared with other cystic lesions.
   METHODS: We performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 12 patients with cystic intracranial lesions (pyogenic abscess, n = 5; cysticercus cysts, n = 2; and low-grade astrocytoma, n = 5). Mean FA, Dav from the lesion core, perifocal edema, and corresponding contralateral normal-appearing regions were measured and compared for relative changes in these parameters. In the abscess cases, we placed regions of interest on areas with FA > 0.2 and FA < 0.2 to get FA and D., values.
   RESULTS: There were two patterns of FA values in the abscess cavity in all five patients. Part of the abscess showed mean FA = 0.440 +/- 0.135, with D., = (0.993 +/- 0.185) X 10(-3) mm(2)/s, whereas other parts had FA = 0.131 +/- 0.039 with D-av = (0.824 +/- 0.183) X 10(-3) mm(2)/s. The cystic tumors and neurocysticercosis showed very high D-av = (2.806 +/- 0.25, 2.654 +/- 0.35) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, with low FA = (0.108 +/- 0.037, 0.08 +/- 0.01), respectively.
   CONCLUSION. Brain abscess cavity shows regions of increased FA values with restricted mean diffusivity compared with other cystic intracranial lesions. This information may prevent misinterpretation of the DTI information as white matter fiber bundle abnormalities associated with mass lesions.

TI Diffusion-weighted imaging of fungal cerebral infection
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAIN; ABSCESS; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is useful in diagnosing bacterial brain abscesses, but DWI features of fungal brain abscesses have not been characterized. Because fungal abscesses are not purulent, we hypothesized that their DWI characteristics are distinct from those of bacterial abscesses.
   METHODS: We reviewed clinical, neuropathologic and neuroimaging findings of patients with fungal brain infections due to Aspergillus (n = 6), Rhizopus (n = 1), or Scedosporium (n = 1) species. DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained before definitive diagnosis and antifungal therapy. ADC ratios (lesion/contralateral white matter) were calculated.
   RESULTS: Two patients had a rapidly progressive, fatal course, with cerebritis and acute inflammation; fungal organisms were largely restricted to vessels. Lesions were predominantly nonenhancing and had heterogeneous foci of restricted diffusion. Six patients with subacute neurologic presentations had acute or chronic inflammation, capsule formation, focal necrosis, and fungal organisms disseminated throughout the lesion. Their abscesses were ring enhancing. In five, lesions had restricted diffusion in the central nonenhancing portions. The sixth patient had a lesion with a peripheral rim of restricted diffusion but elevated central diffusion; histopathology showed early abscess formation. Mean ADC for all lesions was 0.33 +/- 0.06 X 10(-3) mm(2)/s, with an average ADC ratio of 0.43.
   CONCLUSION: Fungal cerebral abscesses may have central restricted diffusion similar to that of bacterial abscesses but with histologic features of acute or chronic inflammation and necrosis rather than suppuration. Altered water diffusion in these lesions likely reflects highly proteinaceous fluid and cellular infiltration.

   VALIDATION; ENHANCEMENT; OXYGENATION; CARCINOMA; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiation of malignant from benign head and neck lesions is often very difficult on imaging studies, especially in patients with treated cancer. We evaluated the feasibility and reproducibility of perfusion CT (CTP) after enhanced head and neck CT and attempted to differentiate benign from malignant processes.
   METHODS: CTP was attempted in 17 patients after head and neck contrast-enhanced CT. Data were postprocessed by using deconvolution-based perfusion analysis. Ipsilateral and contralateral internal, external, and common carotid arteries were used as arterial input vessels. Postprocessing-generated maps showed mean transit time (MTT), blood volume, blood flow, and capillary permeability surface product. Two readers independently placed regions of interest through the primary site, salivary glands, thyroid gland, paraspinous muscles, muscles of mastication, sternocleidomastoid muscle, base of tongue, and subcutaneous fat. One reader repeated the measurements on separate dates. Data were statistically analyzed, and histologic specimens were obtained.
   RESULTS: CTP was not possible in four patients, and one was lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 12, five had cancer, and seven had benign processes. We found no significant interreader or intrareader differences and no significant difference between various input vessels. Differentiation between malignant and nonmalignant lesions was most reliable by using MTTs. Measurements were comparable to those in the literature.
   CONCLUSION. CTP after enhanced head and neck CT is feasible, except perhaps at the laryngeal level. It appears to be reader independent and reproducible regardless of the input vessel. CTP shows promise in distinguishing benign and malignant processes, primarily by means of MTTs.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and lymphoma are common malignant tumors of the head and neck. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in line scan diffusion-weighted imaging (LSDWI) is useful for distinguishing between SCC and lymphoma. of the head and neck.
   METHODS: LSDWI was prospectively performed in 39 patients with SCC and in 14 patients with lymphoma. Images were obtained with a diffusion-weighted factor (b factor) of 5 and 1000 s/mm(2), and ADC maps were generated. ADC values were measured for the two types of tumor.
   RESULTS: Mean ADC values were 0.96 +/- 0.11 X 10(-3) mm(2)/s for SCC and 0.65 +/- 0.09 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for lymphoma; the difference was significant (P <.001). All but one of the patients with lymphoma had ADC values lower than the lowest ADC (0.76 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) in patients with SCC. When an ADC of 0.76 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s was used to distinguish between SCC and lymphoma, accuracy was 98% (52 of 53 lesions).
   CONCLUSION. ADC values appear to be useful for distinguishing between SCC and lymphoma in the head and neck.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important in patient assessment and prognosis, yet they are underestimated with conventional imaging techniques. We used MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to detect DAI and determine whether metabolite ratios are accurate in predicting long-term outcomes and to examine regional differences in injury between children with TBI and control subjects.
   METHODS: Forty children with TBI underwent transverse proton MRSI through the level of the corpus callosum within 1-16 days after injury. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and susceptibility-weighted MR imaging was used to identify voxels as normal-appearing or as nonhemorrhagic or hemorrhagic injury. Neurologic outcome was evaluated at 6-12 months after injury. Metabolite ratios for total (all voxels), normal-appearing, and hemorrhagic brain were compared and used in a logistic regression model to predict long-term outcome. Total and regional metabolite ratios were compared with control data.
   RESULTS: A significant decrease in N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and increase in choline (Cho)/Cr (evidence of DAI) was observed in normal-appearing (P <.05) and visibly injured (hemorrhagic) brain (P <.001) compared with controls. In normal-appearing brain NAA/Cr decreased more in patients with poor outcomes (1.32 +/- 0.54) than in those with good outcomes (1.61 +/- 0.50, P =.01) or control subjects (1.86 +/- 0.1, P =.00). In visibly injured brains, ratios were similarly altered in all patients. In predicting outcomes, ratios from normal-appearing and visibly-injured brain were 85% and 67% accurate, respectively.
   CONCLUSION. MRSI can depict injury in brain that appears normal on imaging and is useful for predicting long-term outcomes.

AB Using MRI, we demonstrated that the depiction of the cerebral white matter fiber tracts has become a routine procedure. Diffusion tensor (DT) sequences may be analyzed with combined volume analysis and tractography extraction software, giving indirect visualization of white matter connections. We obtained DT data from 20 subjects with normal MR imaging and five patients presenting cerebral diseases such as brain tumors, multiple sclerosis and stroke, with five patients explored on two different MR scanners. Data were transferred to dedicated workstations for anatomical realignment, determination of voxel eigenvectors and calculation of fiber tract orientations in a region of interest. In all subjects, axonal directions underlying the main neuronal pathways could be delineated. Comparisons between diseased regions and contralateral areas demonstrated changes in voxel anisotropy in injured regions, revealing possible preferential fiber orientations within diffuse T2 hyperintensities. Rapid data processing allows imaging of the normal and diseased fiber pathways as part of the routine MRI examination. Therefore, it appears that whenever white matter disease is suspected a tractography can be performed with this fast and simple method that we proved to be reliable and reproducible.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gliomas are heterogeneous tumors with increased microvasculature, hypoxia, and necrosis. The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution and relationship of the MR-derived relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), lactate (Lac), and mobile lipids (Lip), which have been proposed as markers for these phenomena of gliomas in vivo.
   METHODS: Twenty-three patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were examined before surgical biopsy and/or resection (seven grade II, rive grade III, and II grade IV), and 27 patients were studied after surgery but before radiation treatment and/or chemotherapy (11 grade II, two grade III, and 14 grade IV gliomas). Lac and Lip were estimated from Lac-edited three-dimensional MR spectroscopic images. Dynamic susceptibility-contrast MR imaging was applied to obtain perfusion-weighted images and rCBV maps.
   RESULTS: Before surgical biopsy/resection, one low-grade and 12 of 16 high-grade gliomas had significantly elevated Lac. No low-grade and 10 of 16 high-grade gliomas had significantly elevated Lip. In presurgical high-grade gliomas, volumes of elevated Lip and macronecrosis were significantly correlated. rCBV was significantly increased in regions with elevated Lac. After we excluded macronecrosis, the rCBV for regions with elevated Lip but no Lac was significantly higher than rCBV in regions with elevated Lac but no Lip. After surgical biopsy/ resection, more low-grade patients showed significantly elevated Lac and Lip than before.
   CONCLUSION. The in vivo distribution of rCBV, Lac, and Lip, as evaluated with three-dimensional MR spectroscopic imaging, may help in the diagnosis and selection of the most appropriate therapy for patients with gliomas.

ID CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME; HYPERTENSIVE
   ENCEPHALOPATHY; BRAIN-TUMORS; DIFFUSION; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The physiological mechanism that gives rise to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is currently unknown. We sought to better understand the mechanism of the edema formation in PRES and specifically hypothesized that this edema is caused by increased vascular permeability.
   METHODS: Eight consecutive patients with PRES who had been studied by using perfusion MR imaging were retrospectively identified. Perfusion images were obtained using a gradient-echo echo planar sequence with contrast enhancement. Measures of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and vascular permeability (K2) were calculated in the affected posterior brain areas and normalized to values obtained in unaffected anterior brain. These values were compared with those found in healthy subjects.
   RESULTS: Regions of interest within the posterior affected brain indicated a significant increase in ADC values in all but one patient, a significant decrease in CBV and CBF values in all patients with PRES (average 30% of control), variable changes in MTT, and no measurable changein K2.
   CONCLUSION. The decrease in both CBV and CBF in PRES supports the theory of autoregulatory vasoconstriction; changes in K2 were not detected.

ID DETACHABLE COILS; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT;
   COMPACTION; VOLUME
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In coiling cerebral aneurysms, high packing prevents reopening over time. The purpose of this study was to compare packing of cerebral aneurysms treated with two types of coils with different wire thickness and different shapes.
   METHODS: Packing, defined as the ratio between the volume of inserted coils and the volume of an aneurysm, was calculated for 144 cerebral aneurysms treated in 130 patients. Seventy-two aneurysms were treated with predominantly helical-shaped coils of 0.010-inch-diameter wire, and 72 aneurysms were treated with predominantly complex-shaped coils of 0.012-inch-diameter wire. Aneurysm volume was assessed from three-dimensional angiography. Aneurysm packing, inserted coil lengths, and numbers of coils were compared for both types of coils.
   RESULTS: Mean packing was significantly higher (absolute value, 6.4%; relative value, 26.6%; P < .0001) in aneurysms coiled with 0.012-inch-diameter coils than aneurysms coiled with 0.010-inch-diameter coils. Inserted coil length per cubic millimeter of aneurysmal volume was equal for both types of coils.
   CONCLUSION: Use of complex-shaped coils with a wire diameter of 0.012 inch to coil cerebral aneurysms results in significantly better packing than is achieved with helical coils of 0.010-inch-diameter wire.

AB Background and Purpose. Reduced resting global cerebral blood flow has been previously detected in association with heart failure (HF), but it is not clear whether there are brain regions that could be specifically affected by those brain perfusion deficits. The authors used a fully automated, voxel-based image analysis method to investigate, across the entire cerebral volume, the presence of resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities in HF patients compared to healthy controls. Methods. rCBF was evaluated with Tc-99m-single-photon emission computed tomography in 17 HF patients (New York Heart Association functional class II or III) and 18 elderly healthy volunteers. Voxel-based analyses of rCBF data were conducted using the statistical parametric mapping software. Results. Significant rCBF reductions in HF patients relative to controls (P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons) were detected in 2 foci, encompassing, respectively, the left and right precuneus and cuneus and the right lateral temporoparietal cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus. In the HF group, there was also a significant direct correlation between the degree of cognitive impairment as assessed using the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination and rCBF on a voxel cluster involving the right posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, located closely to the site where between-group rCBF differences had been identified. Conclusions. These preliminary findings indicate that posterior cortical areas of the brain may be particularly vulnerable to brain perfusion reductions associated with HF and suggest that functional deficits in these regions might be relevant to the pathophysiology of the cognitive impairments presented by HF patients.

AB Background and Purpose. Pyogenic and tuberculous spondylitis can mimic malignancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in differentiating spinal infection and malignancy. Methods. Fifty-one consecutive patients with suspected spinal infection or malignancy were enrolled in the study. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of paraspinal soft tissue mass and normal and abnormal vertebral bone marrow were determined on the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images of the spine. The mean ADCs of normal and abnormal vertebral bodies in patients with confirmed infection or malignancy were compared using nonparametric tests. Results. ADCs of 69 tuberculous, 9 pyogenic, and 50 malignant vertebral marrow lesions were significantly higher than ADCs of normal marrow. ADCs of malignant bone marrow and 5 paraspinal soft tissue lesions were significantly lower than tuberculosis and pyogenic infection. There was no significant difference between the ADCs of 44 adult and 25 pediatric tuberculous bone lesions or between tuberculosis and pyogenic infection. Using the cutoff ADC of 1.02 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s for bone marrow, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 60.26%, 66.00%, and 62.50%, respectively, for distinguishing infection from malignancy. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy increased to 94.12%, 82.35%, and 90.20%, respectively, when the ADCs of associated soft tissue lesions were higher than 1.17 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s. Conclusions. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has limited usefulness for differentiating spinal infection and malignancy.

   TIP
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to assess the utility of contrast-enhanced MR angiography at 6 months after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Guglielmi detachable coils.
   METHODS: Contrast-enhanced MR angiography was performed in 47 patients at 6 and 12 months after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms (48 aneurysms). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was used as reference and was performed at 12 months after the treatment in all patients. MR angiographs were analyzed independently by two senior radiologists. DSA and MR angiography findings were assigned into one of three categories: complete obliteration, residual neck, or residual aneurysm.
   RESULTS: All examinations were assessable. Interobserver agreement was judged as very good for contrast-enhanced MR angiography (kappa = 0.96), with one discrepancy between examiners. Comparison between MR angiography at 6 months and DSA at 12 months showed an excellent agreement between techniques (kappa = 0.93). Two cases of complete occlusion at DSA were misclassified as a residual neck at 6-month MR angiography. All aneurysm recanalizations at DSA already were detected on MR angiography at 6 months. The size of aneurysm recanalization did not increase between both MR angiographs performed at 6 and 12 months.
   CONCLUSION. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography after selective embolization of intracranial aneurysm seems to predict properly early aneurysm recanalizations.

AB Time-resolved, contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography combined with parallel imaging at 3T was applied to an intracranial arteriovenous malformation, a dural arteriovenous fistula, and an extracranial facial arteriovenous malformation. The temporal resolution was one image every 1.5 seconds. Arterial feeders were depicted in all three cases. Early venous drainage was observed in the intracerebral arteriovenous malformation and the dural arteriovenous fistula, but not in the facial arteriovenous malformation. All findings were concordant with conventional angiography.

   IMPAIRMENT; PRESENILE; PERFUSION
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM), used for detecting brain atrophy, permits comparison of local gray matter concentration at every voxel in an image between two groups. We sought to delineate the specific patterns of cerebral gray matter loss with regard to onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by using MR imaging and VBM and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of VBM with Z score images.
   METHODS: Two groups of 30 patients with mild AD of different ages of onset were examined. Mean ages in the early- and late-onset groups were 60.2 +/- 5.2 and 71.5 +/- 2.6 years, respectively. Control subjects were aged-matched healthy volunteers. Regions of gray matter loss in early- and late-onset AD were examined with VBM. Diagnostic performance of Z score images obtained with the VBM method was evaluated in patients and control subjects by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)).
   RESULTS: Both AD groups had significantly reduced gray matter in the bilateral medial temporal regions. In addition, the early-onset group had more severe gray matter loss in the bilateral parietal and posterior cingulate cortices and precuneus region. No difference was noted in diagnostic performance of Z score images between the early- (A(z) = 0.9435) and late-onset (A(z) = 0.9018) groups.
   CONCLUSION. Differences were noted in the patterns of regional gray matter loss in patients with early-onset AD versus those with late-onset AD. Parietotemporal and posterior cingulate gray matter loss was found in early-onset AD but not in late-onset AD. Z score images obtained with VBM had a great diagnostic performance for mild AD and can be applied for detecting mild AD in clinical examinations.

TI Prospective analysis of cerebral infarction after carotid endarterectomy

   SILENT EMBOLISM; ACUTE STROKE; ANGIOPLASTY; STENOSIS
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Small emboli arising from a friable plaque during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stent placement (CAS) constitute a potentially important cause of periprocedural ischemic complications. To evaluate the frequency and significance of cerebral ischemic lesions of embolic origin after CEA and CAS, we examined patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis by using diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging.
   METHODS: Twenty-four patients undergoing 26 CEAs and 20 patients undergoing 22 CAS were prospectively studied with pre- and post-treatment DW imaging of the brain within 7 days (mean, 2.3 days) before and within 7 days (mean, 3.2 days) after treatment. DW images were analyzed by two neuroradiologists blinded to the clinical results after CEA and CAS. Any new hyperintense lesion on DW image was interpreted as a post-treatment ischemic lesion. We compared post-treatment ischemic lesions with change in neurologic status, presence of plaque ulcerations, and severity of stenosis and compared the frequency of overall post-treatment complications between the two procedures.
   RESULTS: In 25 (96%) of 26 CEAs, post-operative brain DW images were unchanged. In one patient (4%), a new single asymptomatic hyperintensity was observed in the striatocapsule on the surgical side. In 14 (64%) of 22 CAS procedures, post-operative brain DW images were unchanged. In eight CAS cases (36%), new hyperintensities were seen on DW images. Among them, two were symptomatic with a major neurologic deficit lasting more than 7 days. Post-treatment brain or retinal major stroke rates were 4% (n = 1) for CEA and 14% (n = 3) for CAS. Overall symptomatic complication rates were 19.2% and 13.6%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION. Rate of ischemic brain lesions was significantly lower after CEA than after CAS, although most of these brain lesions were silent. Also, CEA is a safer procedure carrying a lower risk of post-operative cerebral ischemia. CAS, however, may be a comparable procedure considering the total complication rate and can be a more reliable procedure with advances in neuroprotective means.

AB We applied a single-shot echo-planar axial diffusion tensor sequence with parallel imaging for tractography of the cervical cord. Placing a large region of interest on a reconstructed sagittal image, the cervical cord was depicted as a tract bundle showing color-encoded cephalocaudally. By setting one region of interest in the cerebral peduncle and another in the entire cord on source images, tracts on each side were visualized. This method is promising for tractography of the cervical cord.

AB We have reviewed initial diagnostic features, treatment, and outcome in 29 patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage due to non-traumatic vertebrobasilar artery dissection diagnosed in our hospital between 1993 and 2003. The dissections occurred in the vertebral artery in 19 patients, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery ( PICA) in two patients, the basilar artery in four patients, and in the vertebral artery extending into the PICA in four patients. A pseudoaneurysm was found in 20 patients. Clinical manifestations typically included sudden onset of moderate to severe headache, nuchal rigidity, and drowsiness. Fourteen patients were treated conservatively. Fifteen patients underwent endovascular treatment with either parent artery occlusion ( 13 patients) or aneurysmal coil occlusion with preservation of the parent artery ( 2 patients). Re-bleeding occurred within 12 days and before treatment in nine patients. Eight of these had a pseudoaneurysm. No patient bled after endovascular treatment. Poor grade and early re-bleeding were associated with less favorable outcome. Outcome at 6 months did not differ significantly between endovascular and conservative treatment. Altogether, good recovery was achieved for 16 patients, moderate disability was seen in one, severe disability in four, and eight patients ( 27%) died. The absence of bleeding subsequent to endovascular treatment in this study suggests that endovascular treatment may be a rational approach in these patients at high risk of re-bleeding, especially those with a pseudoaneurysm.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the early stage of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), conventional MR imaging parameters such as T2 lesion load fail to explain the clinical status of patients. In the present work, we aimed to determine the ability of magnification transfer imaging to better reflect the relationship between local tissue damage and functional status of MS patients.
   METHODS: We performed a comparative statistical mapping analysis on brain tissue magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) data measured in 18 patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS (CISSMS) and 18 matched control subjects.
   RESULTS: In the patients with CISSMS, a pattern of significant low MTR values was observed in the white matter, corpus callosum, bilateral occipitofrontal fascicles, right fornix, right parietal white matter, external capsule, right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, optica radiata, parietal white matter, right cingulum, gray matter, bilateral thalamus, bilateral caudate, right insula, and left Brodmann area (BA) 8. No correlation was found between local MTR decrease and Expanded Disability Status Scale score. Significant correlations between MTR and MS Functional Composite scores (Spearman rank test, P < .05) were observed in the left BA40, right SLF, right frontal white matter, splenium, and anterior corpus callosum. Local MTR values correlated with Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test scores in the left BA40, right BA4, right SLF, and splenium.
   CONCLUSION: Statistical mapping analysis of brain MTR data provides valuable information on the relationship between the location of brain tissue damage and its functional impact in patients with MS, even in the earliest stage of the disease.

AB The aim of this paper was to determine the correlation between calcium burden ( expressed as a volume) and extent of stenosis of the origin of the artery (ICA) by CT angiography (CTA). Previous studies have shown that calcification in the coronary arteries correlates with significant vessel stenosis, and severe calcification ( measured by CT) in the carotid siphon correlates with significant ( greater than 50% stenosis) as determined angiographically. Sixty-one patients ( age range 50-85 years) underwent CT of the neck with intravenous administration of iodinated contrast for a variety of conditions. Images were obtained with a helical multidetector array CT scanner and reviewed on a three-dimensional workstation. A single observer manipulated window and level to segment calcified plaque from vascular enhancement in order to quantify vascular calcium volume ( cc) in the region of the bifurcation of the common carotid artery/ICA origin, and to measure the extent of ICA stenosis near the origin. A total of 117 common carotid artery bifurcations were reviewed. A "significant'' stenosis was defined arbitrarily as > 40% ( to detect lesions before they become hemodynamically significant) of luminal diameter on CTA using NASCET-like criteria. All "significant'' stenoses ( 21 out of 117 carotid bifurcations) had measurable calcium. We found a relatively strong correlation between percent stenosis and the calcium volume (Pearson's r = 0.65, P < 0.0001). We also found that there was an even stronger correlation between the square root of the calcium volume and the percent stenosis as measured by CTA (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001). Calcium volumes of 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 cc were used as thresholds to evaluate for a "significant'' stenosis. A receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve demonstrated that thresholds of 0.06 cc ( sensitivity 88%, specificity 87%) and 0.03 cc ( sensitivity 94%, specificity 76%) generated the best combinations of sensitivity and speci. city. Hence, this preliminary study demonstrates a relatively strong relationship between volume of calcium at the carotid bifurcation in the neck ( measured by CT) and percent stenosis of the ICA below the skull base ( as measured by CTA). Use of calcium volume measurements as a threshold may be both sensitive and speci. c for the detection of significant ICA stenosis. The significance of the correlation between calcium volume and ICA stenosis is that potentially a "score'' can be obtained that will identify those at risk for high grade carotid stenosis.
