This study compares the performances of three classification methods based on support vector machines (SVMs), using as initial sets of brain voxels (ie, features): (1) the segmented grey matter (GM); (2) regions of interest (ROIs) by voxel-wise t-test filtering; (3) parceled ROIs, according to prior knowledge. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) is applied in all cases to investigate whether feature reduction improves the classification accuracy. We analyzed more than 600 AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects, training the SVMs on the AD/CTRL dataset, and evaluating them on a trial MCI dataset. The classification performance, evaluated as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), reaches AUC = (88.9 +/- .5)% in 20-fold cross-validation on the AD/CTRL dataset, when the GM is classified as a whole. The highest discrimination accuracy between MCI converters and nonconverters is achieved when the SVM-RFE is applied to the whole GM: with AUC reaching (70.7 +/- .9)%, it outperforms both ROI-based approaches in predicting the AD conversion.","[Retico, Alessandra; Fantacci, Maria Evelina] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Sez Pisa, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.","Retico, A (reprint author), Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Sez Pisa, Largo Bruno Pontecorvo 3, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",Alessandra.Retico@pi.infn.it,49,20,20,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-2284,1552-6569,J NEUROIMAGING,J.

The device migrated proximally in 4 patients and distally in 1 patient. One patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and died as a result of migration of the Pipeline Embolization Device, and another patient presented with complete MCA occlusion and was left severely disabled. Mismatch in arterial diameter between inflow and outflow vessels was a constant finding. Migration of the Pipeline Embolization Device was managed conservatively, with additional placement of the device, or with parent vessel occlusion. Obtaining complete expansion of the embolization device by using a longer device, increasing vessel coverage, using adjunctive aneurysm coiling, and avoiding dragging and stretching of the device are important preventive measures.

These solute protons are selectively saturated using low bandwidth RF irradiation and saturation is transferred to bulk water protons via chemical exchange, resulting in an attenuation of the measured water proton signal. CEST MRI is an advanced MRI technique with wide application potential due to the ability to examine complex molecular contributions. CEST MRI at high field (7 Tesla [7 T]) will improve the overall results due to increase in signal, T-1 relaxation time, and chemical shift dispersion. Increased field strength translates to enhanced quantification of the metabolite of interest, allowing more fundamental studies on underlying pathophysiology. CEST contrast is affected by several tissue properties, such as the concentrations of exchange partners and their rate of proton exchange, whose effects have been examined and explored in this review. We have highlighted the background of CEST MRI, typical implementation strategy, and complications at 7 T.","[Dula, Adrienne N.; Smith, Seth A.; Gore, John C.] Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Imaging Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.","Dula, AN (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Radiol & Radiol Sci, Med Ctr, 1161 21st Ave South,AA 1101 MCN, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",adrienne.n.dula@vanderbilt.edu,52,18,18,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-2284,1552-6569,J NEUROIMAGING,J.

While diffusion tensor imaging is useful for the study of anisotropic systems such as WM tracts, it is of more limited utility in tissues with more isotropic microstructures (on the length scales studied with diffusion MR imaging) such as gray matter. In contrast, diffusional kurtosis imaging, which measures both Gaussian and non-Gaussian properties of water diffusion, provides more biomarkers of both anisotropic and isotropic structural changes. The aim of this study was to investigate the cervical spinal cord of patients with MS and to characterize lesional and normal-appearing gray matter and WM damage by using diffusional kurtosis imaging.","[Raz, E.; Bester, M.; Sigmund, E.

Although its clinical characteristics are well described, its anatomical and pathophysiological underpinnings are poorly understood. This study examined the anatomical distribution of white matter (WM) changes in patients with mild to moderate HLGD of the cautious/disequilibrium type, using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. METHODS Thirteen patients with HLGD, 9 elderly and 13 middle-aged healthy controls were scanned using diffusion tensor imaging, Q-space imaging, and conventional MRI. The regions of significant differences between the HLGD group and the elderly control group were defined, and the mean fractional anisotropy and displacement values of these areas were extracted. RESULTS The HLGD patients had lower fractional anisotropy and higher displacement values in regions related to the motor system, including those along the corticospinal tract and the superior cerebellar peduncles, as well as in cognitive and affective-related areas, including the anterior limbs of the internal capsule and the genu of the corpus callosum.

To compare quality of MR angiography (MRA) acquisitions at various field strengths, we used 3-dimensional (3D) geometric cerebrovascular models extracted from 1.5T/3T/7T scans. METHODS The 3D cerebrovascular models were compared in volume, length, and number of branches. A relationship between the vascular length and volume was statistically derived. Acquisition performance was benchmarked against the maximum volume at infinitive length. RESULTS The numbers of vessels discernible on 1.5T/3T/7T are 138/363/907. 3T shows 3.3(1.9) and 7T 1.2(9.1) times more arteries (veins) than 1.5T. The vascular lengths and volumes at 1.5T/3T/7T are 3.7/12.5/22.7 m and 15.8/26.6/28.0 cm3. For arteries: 3T-1.5T gain is very high in length, high in volume; 7T-3T gain is medium in length, small in volume. For veins: 3T-1.5T gain is moderate in length, high in volume; 7T-3T gain is very high in length, moderate in volume. 1.5T shows merely half of vascular volume. At 3T 6%, while at 7T only 1% of vascular volume is missing. CONCLUSION Our approach differs from standard approaches based on visual assessment and signal (contrast)-to-noise ratio. It also measures absolute acquisition performance, provides a unique length-volume relationship, and predicts length/volume for intermediate teslages.","[Nowinski, Wieslaw L.; Puspitasaari, Fiftarina; Volkau, Ihar; Marchenko, Yevgen] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Biomed Imaging Lab, Singapore 138671, Singapore.","Nowinski, WL (reprint author), Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Biomed Imaging Lab, 30 Biopolis St,07-01 Matrix, Singapore 138671, Singapore.",wieslaw@sbic.a-star.edu.sg,22,12,13,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-2284,1552-6569,J NEUROIMAGING,J.

As such, it is frequently reported as an incidental finding in computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography studies. Here, we review the embryology, anatomy, and angiographic imaging findings, including important variants of this commonly encountered cerebrovascular anomaly (reported incidence of PTA/PTA variants ranges from 0.1% to 0.76%). Further, the aim is to present the range of associated arterial anomalies or syndromes, as well as pathologies that are associated with a PTA: aneurysms, trigeminal cavernous fistulas, and trigeminal nerve compression. Besides summarizing the risks and clinical presentation of such pathologies, their management is discussed with endovascular strategies mostly being the primary choice for aneurysms and trigeminal cavernous fistulas. Symptomatic trigeminal nerve compression can be treated with microvascular decompression surgery. As an illustrative example, a case of a trigeminal cavernous fistula on a PTA variant is included, mainly to emphasize the importance of understanding the variant anatomy for treatment planning in such pathologies. Finally, recommendations on how to manage patients with PTA-associated vascular pathologies are advanced.","[Meckel, Stephan; McAuliffe, William] Sir Charles Gairdner & Royal Perth Hosp, NIISWA, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.","Meckel, S (reprint author), Univ Hosp Freiburg, Neuroctr, Dept Neuroradiol, Breisacher Str 64, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",stephanmeckel@gmail.com,122,31,36,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,JAN,2013,55,1,5,16,10.1007/s00234-011-0995-3,12,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",078AX,WOS:000314071600002,22170080,02/05/2020,,"Meckel, Stephan/0000-0001-6468-4526",,,,"Meckel, Stephan/I-5810-2018",,,,,,,2.091254753,"['inferior cerebellar', 'internal carotid-artery', 'cavernous sinus fistula']",,,,,,,,,no,,,,

The diagnosis can only be made accurately by biopsy/autopsy. However, this is not always feasible or desirable. Thus, diagnostic criteria have been proposed by UCSF, European MRI-CJD Consortium, and WHO. We will compare these criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective study of 31 patients (average age of 69.2 years) between 2003 to 2010 by ICD9 codes 046.1, 046.11, and 046.19. RESULTS All patients presented with rapidly progressive dementia (mean duration of 4.25 months). Pyramidal and extrapyramidal findings, myoclonus, cerebellar changes, akinetic mutism, and visual disturbances were observed in 6.5-48.4%. Five had periodic pattern on EEG. CSF biomarker 14-3-3 was positive in 11. Tau was positive in 6. Neuron specific enolase was positive in 9. By consensus (kappa = 0.62), MRI was typical of CJD in 23 with cortical ribboning (n = 16), basal ganglia hyperintensity (n = 15), or combination (n = 8). By WHO criteria, which does not include neuroimaging, CJD was diagnosed in 10, but 14 if any CSF biomarker was used (p = NS). The UCSF criteria, which does not include CSF biomarkers, diagnosed 18 cases, and the European MRI-CJD Consortium, which includes neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers but with less neurological signs, diagnosed 23 cases (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). CJD-mimics included urosepsis, neurosarcoidosis, idiopathic left temporal lobe epilepsy, alcohol intoxication, central nervous system vasculitis, viral encephalitis, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION This study illustrates the variability in diagnosing CJD and emphasizes the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging. It also highlights false-positives that occur with neuroimaging.","[Newey, C. R.; Sarwal, A.; Wisco, D.; Alam, S.; Lederman, R.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A group of 34 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (28 relapsing and 6 progressive) and 15 healthy controls had whole spinal cord 3-mm thick T2-weighted axial fast spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images obtained at 3T. For each participant, four volumes were measured (C2-3 volume, cervical cord volume, thoracic cord volume, and whole cord volume). The volumes were normalized by the number of slices and three potential measures of body size (intracranial volume [ICV], body mass index, and body surface area) using the proportional method. RESULTS All raw volumes and volumes normalized by number of slices or ICV were significantly lower in progressive MS patients compared to relapsing MS patients/healthy controls (P < .05). In addition, C2-3 volume and cervical cord volume were significantly correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale score (P < .05). All regional volumes showed high intercorrelation, and normalization by the number of slices significantly increased some correlations. Regarding reliability, whole cord volume regardless of normalization technique had lower coefficient of variation than C2-3 volume. CONCLUSIONS Since normalization factor had limited impact on reliability and the ability to detect differences, normalization by the number of slices is recommended.","[Healy, Brian C.; Arora, Ashish; Ceccarelli, Antonia; Tauhid, Shahamat S.; Neema, Mohit; Bakshi, Rohit] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Biostat, Dept Neurol,Med Sch, Brookline, MA 02445 USA.","Healy, BC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Biostat, Dept Neurol,Med Sch, 1 Brookline Pl,Suite 602, Brookline, MA 02445 USA.",bchealy@partners.org,19,36,36,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-2284,1552-6569,J NEUROIMAGING,J.

This is attributed to a specific ""glomeruloid"" vascular pattern, which is better characterized by vessel area than number. Despite its prognostic value, MVA quantification is laborious and clinically impractical. The DSC-MR imaging measure of rCBV offers the advantages of speed and convenience to overcome these limitations; however, clinical use of this technique depends on establishing accurate correlations between rCBV, MVA, and MVD, particularly in the setting of heterogeneous vascular size inherent to human HGG.","[Hu, L.

We aimed to look at the full spectrum of neuroimaging findings in JSRD and reviewed the MR imaging of 75 patients with JSRD, including 13 siblings and 4 patients with OFD VI. All patients had VH and enlargement of the fourth ventricle. The degree of VH and the form of the MTS were variable. In most patients, the cerebellar hemispheres were normal and the PF was enlarged. Brain stem morphology was abnormal in 30% of the patients. Supratentorial findings included hippocampal malrotation, callosal dysgenesis, migration disorders, cephaloceles, and ventriculomegaly. All patients with OFD VI had a similar pattern, including HH in 2 patients. No neuroimaging-genotype correlation could be found. The wide neuroimaging spectrum in our patients supports the heterogeneity of JSRD. Neuroimaging differences in siblings represent intrafamilial heterogeneity. Due to the absence of a correlation with genotype, neuroimaging findings are of limited value in classifying patients with JSRD.","[Poretti, A.; Boltshauser, E.] Univ Childrens Hosp Zurich, Div Pediat Neurol, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.","Boltshauser, E (reprint author), Univ Childrens Hosp Zurich, Div Pediat Neurol, Steinweiss 75, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",Eugen.Bolt-shauser@kispi.uzh.ch,18,70,73,0,5,AMER SOC NEURORADIOLOGY,OAK BROOK,"2210 MIDWEST RD, OAK BROOK, IL 60521 USA",0195-6108,,AM J NEURORADIOL,Am.

DWI lesion volumes were small and functional impairment was low; however, perfusion abnormalities were evident. Prolonged AAT values were more likely to reside in the affected hemisphere (significant when compared with controls, P < .048).

Currently, the primary imaging modalities for initial locoregional staging are computed tomography and-to a lesser extent-magnetic resonance imaging, whilst [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography has additional value in the detection of subcentimetric metastatic lymph nodes and of tumour recurrence after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, dependency on the morphological and size-related criteria of anatomical imaging and the limited spatial resolution and FDG avidity of inflammation in metabolic imaging may reduce diagnostic accuracy in the head and neck. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that measures the differences in water mobility in different tissue microstructures. Water mobility is likely influenced by cell size, density, and cellular membrane integrity and is quantified by means of the apparent diffusion coefficient. As such, the technique is able to differentiate tumoural tissue from normal tissue, inflammatory tissue and necrosis. In this article, we examine the use of DWI in head and neck cancer, focussing on technique optimization and image interpretation. Afterwards, the value of DWI will be outlined for clinical questions regarding nodal staging, lesion characterization, differentiation of post-CRT tumour recurrence from necrosis and inflammation, and predictive imaging towards treatment outcome. The possible consequences of adding DWI towards therapeutic management are outlined.","[Vandecaveye, Vincent; De Keyzer, Frederik; Hermans, Robert] Univ Hosp Leuven, Dept Radiol, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.","Vandecaveye, V (reprint author), Univ Hosp Leuven, Dept Radiol, Herestr 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",Vincent.Vandecaveye@uzleuven.be,49,48,54,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,SEP,2010,52,9,773,784,10.1007/s00234-010-0743-0,12,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",635IY,WOS:000280650000002,20631998,02/05/2020,,"nuyts, sandra/0000-0002-5540-4796; Lambrecht,",,,,"nuyts, sandra/U-8254-2019; Lambrecht, Maarten/H-1624-2011",,,,,,,1.854974705,"['positron-emission-tomography', 'cervical lymph-nodes', 'head and neck cancer', 'diagnostic-accuracy', 'diffusion-weighted mri', 'tissue characterization']",,,,,,,,,tumor,,,,

WE is characterized by changes in consciousness, ocular dysfunction, and ataxia. Neuroradiologic findings usually show symmetric signal intensity alterations in the mammillary bodies, medial thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal area. Selective involvement of the cranial nerve nuclei, cerebellum, red nuclei, dentate nuclei, fornix, splenium, cerebral cortex, and basal ganglia characterize nonalcoholic WE patients. Furthermore, symmetric basal ganglia alterations with involvement of the putamen have only been observed in children. The incidence of WE is underestimated in both adult and pediatric patients. Interestingly, the frequency of WE in children appears to be similar to that observed in adults. The prognosis of the disease largely depends on the time from diagnosis to thiamine supplementation. The aim of this pediatric literature review is to provide an update on neuroradiologic findings in children affected by WE in an effort to determine pertinent clinical and imaging findings that can improve the detection and early identification of the disease. A thorough knowledge of the MRI findings of WE will assist in arriving at an early diagnosis, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease in children.","[Zuccoli, Giulio] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Childrens Hosp Pittsburgh, Dept Pediat Radiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15224 USA.","Zuccoli, G (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Childrens Hosp Pittsburgh, Dept Pediat Radiol, Childrens Hosp Dr 4401 Penn Ave Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224 USA.",giulio.zuccoli@gmail.com,56,45,51,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,JUN,2010,52,6,523,529,10.1007/s00234-009-0604-x,7,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",597VJ,WOS:000277790000006,19844698,02/05/2020,,/0000-0001-9734-8035,,,,,,,,,,,1.854974705,"['thiamine-deficiency', 'wernicke encephalopathy', 'thiamine deficiency', 'mr findings', 'hyperemesis gravidarum', 'wernicke-korsakoff']",,,,,,,,,encephalopathy,,,,

Several lines of evidence from physiologic and neuroimaging studies point toward a major role of the cerebellum in this disease. Recently, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been proposed to quantify cerebellar atrophy in ET. However, VBM was not originally designed to study subcortical structures, and the complicated anatomy of the cerebellum may hamper the automatic processing of VBM. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and utility of using automated subcortical segmentation to identify atrophy of the cerebellum and other subcortical structures in patients with ET.","[Quattrone, A.] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept Med Sci, Inst Neurol, Catanzaro, Italy.","Quattrone, A (reprint author), Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept Med Sci, Inst Neurol, Catanzaro, Italy.",a.quattrone@isn.cnr.it,15,78,79,0,2,AMER SOC NEURORADIOLOGY,DENVILLE,"PO BOX 3000, DENVILLE, NJ 07834-9349 USA",0195-6108,1936-959X,AM J NEURORADIOL,Am.

Adequate follow-up examination is necessary to exclude in-stent restenosis. Conventional intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (ia-DSA) is the current gold standard, but it is an invasive technique and carries the risk of neurological complications. Angiographic CT (ACT) is a new technique that provides a volume dataset of the highest spatial resolution and high contrast resolution derived from a rotational acquisition of a c-arm-mounted flat-panel detector. The feasibility of ACT with intravenous administration of contrast medium (iv-ACT) for follow-up after ICAS is demonstrated. In two patients iv-ACT was performed as a follow-up examination 12 months after ICAS. High-resolution volume data from the rotational acquisitions were processed to provide delineation of the stent lumen as well as imaging of the brain parenchyma and vessels. In both patients the patency of the stent lumen was assessed successfully. In addition, all other brain vessels were displayed in a manner similar to their appearance on CT angiograms. The brain parenchyma was also adequately imaged in a manner similar to its appearance on CT images. We demonstrated the feasibility and diagnostic value of iv-ACT for follow-up imaging after ICAS. This new application has the potential to become the imaging method of choice after ICAS since it not only enables visualization of the patency of the stent lumen but also is minimally invasive and provides additional information about all brain arteries and the brain parenchyma.","[Buhk, Jan-Hendrik; Knauth, Michael] Univ Gottingen, Dept Neuroradiol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.","Buhk, JH (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Neuroradiol, Robert Koch Str 40, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",jbuhk@gwdg.de,14,45,48,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,APR,2008,50,4,349,354,10.1007/s00234-007-0342-x,6,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",280DM,WOS:000254405100008,18246336,02/05/2020,,"Lingor, Paul/0000-0001-9362-7096",,,"Green Published, Other Gold","Lingor, Paul/A-5394-2008",,,,,,,2.212051869,"['angioplasty', 'angiographic computed tomography', 'stenosis', 'flat-panel', 'rotational angiography', 'cerebral-angiography']",,,,,,,,,stenosis,,,,

Intimal-medial thickening (IMT) of the carotid wall is an accepted peripheral marker of atherosclerosis. It is associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction and stroke, and lower attention-executive-psychomotor functioning. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between IMT and brain activity during a verbal working memory (VWM) task in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods. Thirteen CVD patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a 2-Back VWM task, and B-mode ultrasound of the carotid arteries. IMT was calculated using an automated algorithm based on a validated edge-detection technique. The relationship between IMT and 2-Back-related brain activity was modeled using partial correlations controlling for age and small vessel disease as measured by white matter signal hyperintensities on MRI (WMH). Results. Higher IMT was associated with lower 2-Back-related signal intensity and in the right middle frontal gyrus, independent of age and WMH. Conclusions. IMT may be one mechanism contributing to brain dysfunction in CVD. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast appears to be highly sensitive to peripheral vascular health as measured by IMT. Future studies should examine the sensitivity and specificity of the BOLD response for predicting cognitive decline in CVD.","Brown Med Sch, Dept Psychiat & Human Behav, Providence, RI USA.","Haley, AP (reprint author), Butler Hosp, Transdisciplinary Res Grp, 345 Blackstone Blvd, Providence, RI 02906 USA.",aphaley@brown.edu,29,20,21,0,4,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1051-2284,,J NEUROIMAGING,J.

Methods: Clinical evaluations were performed at presentation and 24 hours, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months (using modified Rankin scale) after treatment. These end points were compared to matched historical controls treated with IV rt-PA alone. Results: Of the 24 patients, mechanical disruption was undertaken in 17 patients with persistent angiographic occlusion using microcatheter exploration (n = 3), angioplasty (n = 5), snare maneuvers (n = 7), and combination of both (n = 2). Partial or complete recanalization was observed in 10 of the 17 patients. Neurological improvement at 24 hours (>= 4 point reduction in NIHSS score) was observed in 11 of 17 patients. Comparisons with matched controls suggest potential equivalence for symptomatic ICH (0% vs 12%), asymptomatic ICH (18% vs 15%), and early neurological improvement (65% vs 53%). Conclusion: The study shows that aggressive mechanical thrombus disruption in large artery occlusion in the setting of acute ischemic stroke is safe with acceptable rates of ICH and promotes angiographic recanalization.","Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, Zeenat Qureshi Stroke Res Ctr, Clin Trials Div, Newark, NJ 07103 USA.","Qureshi, AI (reprint author), 90 Bergen St,DOC-8100, Newark, NJ 07103 USA.",aiqureshi@hotmail.com,24,22,22,0,0,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1051-2284,,J NEUROIMAGING,J.

This study investigated the association of medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy and cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH], subclinical infarcts) with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) among cognitively normal older adults. Methods. Risk of developing AD was examined for 155 cognitively normal older adults (77.4 years, 60% women, 81% white). The MTL volumes and the presence of WMH and of subclinical infarcts were determined from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the beginning of the study. Follow-up cognitive evaluations (average 4.3 years) identified those who developed AD. Results. The presence of either MTL atrophy or subclinical infarcts was independently and significantly associated with a greater risk to develop AD (OR [95% CI]: 4.4 [1.5, 12.3] and 2.7 [1.0, 7.1], respectively). In addition, those participants with both MTL atrophy and at least one brain infarct had a 7-fold increase in the risk of developing AD (OR [95% CI]: 7.0 [1.5, 33.1]), compared to those who had neither of these conditions. Conclusions. In cognitively normal older adults, markers of neurodegeneration (as reflected by MTL atrophy) and of cerebrovascular disease (as reflected by infarcts on MRI) independently contribute to the risk to develop AD.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Epidemiol, Sch Publ Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.","Rosano, C (reprint author), 130 N Bellefield,Room 519, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",RosanoC@edc.pitt.edu,42,24,24,0,2,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1051-2284,,J NEUROIMAGING,J.

Methods: Data were retrospectively analyzed from 47 subjects who had two MRI scans taken at least nine months apart. Twenty-three subjects had manual segmentation of ICV on the T2-weighted sequence for comparison. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for intraobserver, interobserver, and intraobserver scan-rescan comparisons were 0.96, 0.97 and 0.95. Pearson correlation coefficients between ICV and ICA, averaging the cumulative 1, 2, 3, and 4 most midline slices, were 0.89, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.95. There was a significant marginal increase in explained variance of ICV by measuring two, rather than one, slices (P = 0.001).

Posterior fossa cystic malformations occupy the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces. They may create secondary dynamic effects on the movements of CSF. The aim of this study was to investigate CSF flow alterations in posterior fossa cystic malformations with CSF flow MR imaging. Methods: The study included 40 patients with cystic malformations of the posterior fossa. The patients underwent cardiac-gated phase-contrast cine MR imaging. CSF flow was qualitatively evaluated using an in-plane phase-contrast sequence in the midsagittal plane. The MR images were displayed in a closed-loop cine format. Results: Twelve of the patients had communicating arachnoid cyst, seven had non-communicating arachnoid cyst, ten had mega cisterna magna, six had Dandy-Walker malformation, two had Dandy-Walker variant, and three had Blake's pouch cyst. CSF flow MR imaging indicated the regions of no, slow or higher flow, direction of flow, and abnormal cystic fluid motion. Each malformation displayed a distinct CSF flow pattern. Conclusion: Phase-contrast cine MR imaging for CSF flow evaluation may be a useful adjunct to routine MR imaging in the evaluation of the cystic malformations of the posterior fossa because it can improve the specificity in differentiating such malformations.","Univ Uludag, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, TR-16159 Bursa, Turkey.","Yildiz, H (reprint author), Univ Uludag, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, TR-16159 Bursa, Turkey.",haruny@uludag.edu.tr,41,34,35,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,SEP,2006,48,9,595,605,10.1007/s00234-006-0098-8,11,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",082IF,WOS:000240379200001,16752134,02/05/2020,,"Yildiz, Harun/0000-0003-0848-2561",,,,,,,ESNR 28th Annual Congress/12th Advanced Course,"SEP, 2003","Istanbul, TURKEY",ESNR,1.931330472,"['dandy walker malformation', 'cerebrospinal-fluid flow', 'arachnoid cyst', 'ct cisternography', 'contrast cine mr', 'cine mri', 'intracranial arachnoid']",,,,,,,,,malformation,,,,

Angiographic recanalization has been associated with improvement in clinical outcome. A clot retriever has recently joined an imperfect armamentarium for intraarterial stroke therapy. In this report, we describe successful recanalization of an acute thrombotic occlusion of the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) achieved with a self-expanding stent. Methods: An 82-year-old woman with a history of coronary atherosclerosis and previous cerebellar hemorrhage presented with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 11. Perfusion computed tomography imaging showed a left MCA territory deficit. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a small punctiform insular hyperintensity. Angiography documented occlusion of the inferior division of the left MCA (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction or Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, TIMI/TICI, grade 0). Intraarterial delivery of eptifibatide to the occlusion site failed to recanalize the vessel. Deployment of a self-expanding stent in the occluded segment resulted in complete revascularization of the distal vascular bed. Results: Angiography performed on the next day confirmed patency of the stented vessel segment (TIMI/TICI 3). The patient was discharged 3 days after the procedure (NIHSS 3). MR angiography obtained 3 months after the procedure documented left MCA patency. Conclusion: This technique may have a role worthy of further investigation in acute stroke therapy.","SUNY Buffalo, Sch Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Neurosurg, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.","Levy, EI (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo, Sch Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Neurosurg, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",elevy@buffns.com,21,28,28,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,JUN,2006,48,6,405,408,10.1007/s00234-006-0077-0,4,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",055LT,WOS:000238452900007,16622697,02/05/2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.575107296,"['thrombolysis', 'global burden', 'acute ischemic-stroke', 'acute stroke', 'intracranial', 'angioplasty', 'acute intracranial vessel occlusion']",,,,,,,,,stroke,,,,

Methods: We studied two patients with symptomatic inherited prion disease (P102L) and two pre-symptomatic P102L gene carriers using quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Short echo time spectra were acquired from the thalamus, caudate region and frontal white matter, metabolite levels and ratios were measured and z-scores calculated for individual patients relative to age-matched normal controls. MRS data were compared with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Results: One fCJD case had generalised atrophy and showed increased levels of myo-inositol (MI) in the thalamus (z=3.7). The other had decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (z=4) and diffuse signal abnormality in the frontal white matter. Both asymptomatic gene carriers had normal imaging, but increased frontal white matter MI (z=4.3, 4.1), and one also had increased MI in the caudate (z=5.3). Conclusion: Isolated MI abnormalities in asymptomatic gene carriers are a novel finding and may reflect early glial proliferation, prior to significant neuronal damage. MRS provides potential non-invasive surrogate markers of early disease and progression in inherited prion disease.","UCL, Inst Neurol, Dept Neurodegenerat Dis, Dementia Res Grp, London WC1 3BG, England.","Waldman, AD (reprint author), UCL, Inst Neurol, Dept Neurodegenerat Dis, Dementia Res Grp, Queen Sq, London WC1 3BG, England.",waldman@dementia.ion.ucl.ac.uk,25,17,17,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,JUN,2006,48,6,428,433,10.1007/s00234-006-0068-1,6,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",055LT,WOS:000238452900012,16598479,02/05/2020,,"Waldman, Adam D/0000-0003-4398-6431; Rossor, Martin/0000-0001-8215-3120;",Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC),,,"Rossor, Martin/C-1598-2008",,,,,,,1.931330472,"['h-1 mrs', 'cjd', 'spectroscopy', 'creutzfeldt-jakob-disease', 'mri', 'pulvinar sign', 'dementia', 'prion']",,,,,,,,,cjd,,,,

We consecutively examined 20 subjects within 12 h of stroke onset using a multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) examination consisting of DWI, mean transit time (MTT) as PI parameter, and MR angiography (MRA). T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) on day 7 were also acquired in order to obtain final infarct volume. The following MR parameters were considered: volumetric measures of lesion growth and MTT abnormalities, quantification of regional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and visual inspection of MRA findings. Our results showed: (1) an acute DWI lesion was not predictive of lesion growth and the DWI abnormality did not represent the irreversibly infarcted tissue; (2) ADC values in the ischemic penumbra could not predict tissue at risk; (3) the DWI-PI mismatch did not predict lesion growth, and the PI abnormality overestimated the amount of tissue at risk; and (4) patients with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion had greater initial and final infarct volumes. This study did not demonstrate the prognostic value of a multimodal MR approach in early ischemic stroke; MRA alone provided predictive information about the volumetric evolution of the lesion.","Univ Bari, Dept Neurol & Psychiat Sci, I-70124 Bari, Italy.","Federico, F (reprint author), Univ Bari, Dept Neurol & Psychiat Sci, Piazza G Cesare 12, I-70124 Bari, Italy.",francescofederico@neurol.uniba.it,46,16,21,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,APR,2006,48,4,238,246,10.1007/s00234-005-0045-0,9,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",030FN,WOS:000236619800003,16508783,02/05/2020,,"Tinelli, Andrea/0000-0001-8426-8490",,,,"Tinelli, Andrea/B-6811-2014",,,,,,,2.575107296,"['acute cerebral infarction', 'perfusion imaging', 'acute ischemic stroke', 'perfusion-weighted mri', 'diffusion-weighted imaging', 'attenuated']",,,,,,,,,stroke,,,,

A group of 20 patients with a first acute stroke and stroke MRI within 24 h of symptom onset were retrospectively analyzed. Perfusion maps were derived using four different algorithms to estimate relative mean transit time (rMTT): (1) cerebral blood flow (CBF) arterial input function (AIF)/singular voxel decomposition (SVD); (2) area peak; (3) time to peak (TTP); and (4) first moment method. Lesion volumes based on five different MTT thresholds relative to contralateral brain were compared with each other and correlated with NIHSS score. The first moment method had the highest correlation with NIHSS (r=0.79, P < 0.001) followed by the AIF/SVD method, both of which did not differ significantly from each other with regard to lesion volumes. TTP and area peak derived both volumes, which correlated poorly or only moderately with NIHSS scores. Data from our pilot study suggest that the first moment and the AIF/SVD method have advantages over the other algorithms in identifying the pMRI lesion volume that best reflects clinical severity. At present there seems to be no need for extensive postprocessing and arbitrarily defined delay thresholds in pMRI as the simple qualitative approach with a first moment algorithm is equally accurate. Larger sample sizes which allow comparison between imaging and clinical outcomes are needed to refine the choice of best perfusion parameter in pMRI.","Heidelberg Univ, Dept Neurol, Kopfklin, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.","Schellinger, PD (reprint author), Heidelberg Univ, Dept Neurol, Kopfklin, Neuenheimer Feld 400, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",Peter_Schellinger@med.uni-heidelberg.de,30,23,23,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,FEB,2006,48,2,69,77,10.1007/s00234-005-0012-9,9,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",010SV,WOS:000235219100001,16315062,02/05/2020,,,,,,"Warach, Steven/R-5074-2019",,,,,,,2.360515021,"['acute stroke', 'mean transit time', 'dwi/pwi mismatch', 'hyperacute cerebral-ischemia', 'thrombolytic therapy', 'perfusion mri']",,,,,,,,,stroke,,,,

This reports the clinical, ultrasonographic, and neuroradiological findings in 24 patients with 28 vertebral artery dissections in the neck (4 occurring bilaterally). In 20 patients (83%), the dissection was temporally related to trauma. No patients had an underlying vascular disease, for example, atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. In all, the major initial manifestation was pain in the occipital or neck region. The next most common symptoms were vertigo and nausea (in 17 patients). Clinical manifestations were vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack (TIA) (5 patients: in 2 patients vestibulocerebellar TIA, in 1 patient visual TIA, in 1 patient motor TIA, and in 1 patient brain stem TIA with perioral paresthesia), cerebellar infarction (10 patients, in 4 patients bilateral), brainstem infarction (5 patients), posterior cerebral artery territory infarction (1 patient), and multiple vertebrobasilar ischemic lesions Q patients). Typical angiographic findings were irregular narrowing of the vessel lumen or a tapering stenosis with distal occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a thickened vessel wall with hematoma signal at the site of the dissection. Duplex color-flow imaging was valuable for the early diagnosis of extracranial vertebral artery dissection and for follow-up examinations.

We studied the function (anterior and posterior pituitary hormonal secretion) and morphology using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the HPS in 17 adult patients (seven males, median age 35 years, range 18-59 years) with multisystem LCH. We also evaluated the evolution of structural HPS abnormalities in relation to pituitary function and response to treatment in 12 of these patients during a median follow-up period of 3.75 years (range 1.5-10 years). Of the 17 patients, 14 (82%) had abnormal HPS imaging, and 12 (70%) had more than one area involved. Lack of the bright spot of the posterior pituitary lobe was typically found in all patients with the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI). Eight patients (47%) had infundibular enlargement, six (35%) pituitary infiltration, four (24%) partially or completely empty sella, three (18%) hypothalamic involvement, and two (12%) infundibular atrophy. DI was found in 16 patients (94%) and anterior pituitary hormonal deficiency (APHD) in 10 patients (59%); two patients had single (12%) and 8 (47%) multiple APHD. During the follow-up period there was improvement of the initially demonstrated HPS pathology in seven (47%) patients, and five (33%) of them had received at least one form of treatment. APHD and DI persisted in all patients except in one in whom established gonadotrophin deficiency recovered. In summary, DI and APHD are very common in patients with multisystem LCH and are almost always associated with abnormal HPS imaging.","G Gennimatas Athens Gen Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Diabet, Athens 11527, Greece.","Kaltsas, GA (reprint author), G Gennimatas Athens Gen Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Diabet, 154 Leof Mesog, Athens 11527, Greece.",gkaltsas@endo.gr,36,31,33,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,JAN,2006,48,1,37,44,10.1007/s00234-005-0011-x,8,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",001VK,WOS:000234570600007,16292545,02/05/2020,,"Makras, Polyzois/0000-0002-3231-3357; Kaltsas,",,,,"Makras, Polyzois/AAF-5871-2020; Kaltsas, Gregory/AAD-7193-2019",,,,,,,2.360515021,"['children', 'hypothalamus', 'pituitary function', 'diabetes', 'diabetes-insipidus', 'langerhans cell histiocytosis', 'natural-history', 'pituitary']",,,,,,,,,no,,,,

An improved understanding of this disease is important in choosing therapeutic options. In addition to the ""classical"" berry-type aneurysm, there are various other types of intracranial AA such as infectious, dissecting or giant, partially-thrombosed aneurysms. From the clinician's perspective, the hypothesis that some of these intracranial AA might be due to abluminal factors has been proposed for several years. Indeed, this hypothesis and the empirical use of anti-inflammatory drugs in giant intracranial aneurysms have been confirmed by recent studies reporting that an enzyme involved in the inflammatory cascade (5-lipoxygenase or 5-LO) promotes the pathogenesis of specific aneurysms in humans. 5-LO generates different forms of leukotrienes which are potent mediators of inflammation. Adventitial inflammation leads to a weakening of the media from the abluminal part of the vessel wall due to the release of proinflammatory factors that invade the media, thereby degrading the extracellular matrix, the elastic lamina of the vascular wall, and, finally, the integrity of the vessel lumen. This in turn results in a dilation of the vessel and aneurysm formation. Moreover, neoangiogenesis of vasa vasorum is found in close proximity to 5-LO activated macrophages. In addition to this biological cascade, we argue that repeated subadventitial haemorrhages from the new vasa vasorum play an important role in aneurysm pathogenesis, due to a progressive increase in size mediated by the apposition of new layers of intramural haematoma within the vessel wall. Intracranial giant AA can therefore be regarded as a proliferative disease of the vessel wall induced by extravascular activity. Considering certain aneurysmal vasculopathies as an abluminal disease might alter current therapeutic strategies. Therapy should not only be aimed at the intraluminal repair of the artery, but also cross the vessel wall to reach the vasa vasorum. Drug-eluting stents placed proximal to the lesion and targeted to the origin of the vasa vasorum could be considered as a potential future option. ""Intelligent"" MRI contrast agents (i.e., macrophage marking) could be used to detect vasa vasorum proliferation and weakening of the vessel wall in vivo.","Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Neuroradiol, D-52057 Aachen, Germany.","Krings, T (reprint author), Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Neuroradiol, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52057 Aachen, Germany.",tkrings@izkf.rwth-aachen.de,33,56,59,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,DEC,2005,47,12,931,937,10.1007/s00234-005-1438-9,7,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",990EB,WOS:000233724900009,16136262,02/05/2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.054794521,"['arterial aneurysm', 'inflammation', 'vasa vasorum', '5-lipoxygenase pathway', '5-lipoxygenase', 'giant aneurysm', 'vasa', 'superparamagnetic iron-oxide']",,,,,,,,,aneurysms,,,,

Packing, defined as the ratio between the volume of inserted coils and volume of the aneurysm expressed as percentage, was calculated for 82 intracranial aneurysms treated with detachable coils. Aneurysm volume was assessed from 3D angiography. Reopening of the aneurysmal lumen at the 6-monthfollow-up angiography was dichotomized into present or absent. We assessed whether packing above 24% protected against reopening. Twenty-three of 82 aneurysms (28%) showed reopening. Reopening was caused by compaction in 20 aneurysms and by partial thrombosis, undetected at the time of initial treatment in three aneurysms. Three of 29 aneurysms (10%) with a packing of more than 24% showed reopening. These three aneurysms contained partially intraluminal thrombosis undetected at the time of treatment. We conclude that in coiled intracranial aneurysms packing above 24% protects against reopening by compaction in non-thrombosed aneurysms. Since intraluminal thrombosis may go undetected at the time of treatment, follow-up angiography is still warranted in aneurysms with packing densities greater than 24%.","St Elizabeth Hosp, Dept Radiol, NL-5022 GC Tilburg, Netherlands.","Sluzewski, M (reprint author), St Elizabeth Hosp, Dept Radiol, Hilvarenbeekseweg 60, NL-5022 GC Tilburg, Netherlands.",radiol@knmg.nl,13,48,49,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,DEC,2005,47,12,942,945,10.1007/s00234-005-1446-9,4,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",990EB,WOS:000233724900011,16136261,02/05/2020,,"Sluzewski, Menno/0000-0002-3949-5958",,,,,,,,,,,2.191780822,"['endovascular treatment', 'intracranial aneurysm', 'endovascular therapy', 'aneurysm', 'cerebral aneurysms', 'detachable coils']",,,,,,,,,aneurysms,,,,

Patients with RPLS exhibit bilateral white and gray matter abnormalities in the posterior aspects of the cerebral hemispheres. However, this syndrome may affect the brainstem predominantly, and these cases are designated as hypertensive brainstem encephalopathy. We present here two patients with reversible brainstem encephalopathy: one with hypertension and the other without hypertension. These patients presented with swelling and diffuse hyperintensities of the brainstem in fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted MRI, but with relatively mild clinical symptoms. They recovered without major neurological deficits, but had residual lacunar lesions in the pons. Reversible brainstem encephalopathy with characteristic MRI features was found in both hypertensive and nonhypertensive patients. These patients were diagnosed with a brainstem variant of RPLS, which is potentially fully reversible after an adequate treatment, and therefore should be carefully differentiated from other brainstem disease conditions.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.","Tomimoto, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",tomimoto@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp,16,41,50,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,SEP,2005,47,9,652,656,10.1007/s00234-005-1399-z,5,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",966CT,WOS:000231997900002,15947925,02/05/2020,,,,,,"Fukuyama, Hidenao/AAI-7118-2020",,,,,,,2.328767123,"['rrainstem', 'edema', 'hypertensive encephalopathy', 'mr findings', 'reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome']",,,,,,,,,no,,,,

We report the immediate and midterm clinical and angiographic outcomes of a consecutive series of patients treated since the advent of these technologies. Clinical and radiological records of 134 patients with 142 aneurysms treated between 2001 and 2004 were retrospectively evaluated by an independent neurologist. Endovascular procedures were analyzed by an independent neuroradiologist blinded to all clinical information. Seventy-two ruptured and 60 un-ruptured saccular aneurysms, nine fusiform and one post-traumatic aneurysm were treated. Matrix coils were used in 53% of saccular aneurysms and HydroCoils in 13% of all aneurysms. Neuroform stents were deployed in 19% of aneurysms. Angiographic total or subtotal occlusion was achieved in 76% of cases and in 96% at last follow-up. Aneurysm recanalization was observed in 14% over a mean follow-up of 12 months, and 18% of aneurysms were retreated. Clinically relevant complications occurred in 6.0%, resulting in procedure-related morbidity of 0.6% and 0.6% mortality at 6 months. No aneurysm bled over a cumulative 1,347 months of observation.

From January 1998 to January 2002 27 MRA and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) examinations were analyzed for residual aneurysms and arterial patency following GDC placement. A total number of 33 intracranial aneurysms was analyzed, including 18 located in the posterior circulation. The MRA analysis was based on source images in combination with maximum intensity projections. The IADSA was used as the reference standard. Two aneurysms were excluded from evaluation, because of susceptibility artefacts from other aneurysms, which were clipped. Sensitivity and positive predictive values of MRA in revealing residual aneurysms were, respectively, 89% and 80%. Specificity in ruling out remnant necks and residual flow around coils was, respectively, 91% and 97%, with a negative predictive value of, respectively, 95% and 100%. Specificity and negative predictive value of MRA for arterial occlusion were, respectively, 87% and 100% for the parent arteries and, respectively, 85% and 100% for the adjacent arteries.

For 31 patients, preoperative clinical data and MR findings were consistent with the putative diagnosis of a high-grade glioma, in 23 cases in eloquent regions. Tumor resections were carried out within a 0.5-T MR SIGNA SP/i (GE Medical Systems, USA). The resection of the lesion was carried out using fully MR compatible neurosurgical equipment and was stopped at the point when the operation was considered complete by the surgeon viewing the operation field with the microscope. We repeated imaging to determine the residual tumor volume only visible with MRI. Areas of tissue that were abnormal on these images were localized in the bed of resection by using interactive MR guidance. The procedure of resection, imaging control and interactive image guidance was repeated where necessary. Almost all tissue with abnormal characteristics was resected, with the exception of tissue localized in eloquent brain areas. The diagnosis of glioblastoma was confirmed in all 31 cases. When comparing the tumor volume before resection and at the point where the neurosurgeon would otherwise have terminated surgery (""first control""), residual tumor tissue was detectable in 29/31 patients; the mean residual tumor volume was 30.7 +/- 24%. After repeated resections under interactive image guidance the mean residual tumor volume was 15.1%. At this step we found tumor remnants only in 20/31 patients. The perioperative morbidity (12.9%) was low. Twenty-seven patients underwent sufficient postoperative radiotherapy. We found a significant difference (log(rank)p=0.0037) in the mean survival times of the two groups with complete resection (n=10, median survival time 537 days) and incomplete resection (n=17, median survival time 237 days). The resection of primary glioblastoma multiforme under intraoperative MR guidance as demonstrated is a possibility to achieve a more complete removal of the tumor than with conventional techniques. In our small but homogeneous patient group we found an increase in the median survival time in patients with MRI for complete tumor resection, and the overall surgical morbidity was low.","Univ Leipzig, Dept Neurosurg, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.","Schneider, JP (reprint author), Univ Leipzig, Dept Neurosurg, Liebigstr 20, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",schneidj@medizin.uni-leipzig.de,64,91,96,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,JUL,2005,47,7,489,500,10.1007/s00234-005-1397-1,12,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",947NR,WOS:000230653400001,15951997,02/05/2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.465753425,"['tumor', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'contrast', 'brain', 'high-grade gliomas', 'long-term survival', 'interventional', 'brain-tumor resection']",,,,,,,,,tumor,,,,

However, little is known about how traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects the ACC system. Our purpose was to compare, by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the patterns of cortical activation in patients with cognitive impairment after TBI and those of normal subjects. Cortical activation maps of 11 right-handed healthy control subjects and five TBI patients with cognitive impairment were recorded in response to a Stroop task during a block-designed fMRI experiment. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) was used for individual subjects and group analysis. In TBI patients and controls, cortical activation, found in similar regions of the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes, resembled patterns of activation documented in previous neuroimaging studies of the Stroop task in healthy controls. However, the TBI patients showed a relative decrease in ACC activity compared with the controls. Cognitive impairment in TBI patients seems to be associated with alterations in functional cerebral activity, especially less activation of the ACC. These changes are probably the result of destruction of neural networks after diffuse axonal injury and may reflect cortical disinhibition attributable to disconnection or compensation for an inefficient cognitive process.","Gifu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Gifu 5011194, Japan.","Soeda, A (reprint author), Gifu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011194, Japan.",ccd29400@nyc.odn.ne.jp,35,45,51,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,1432-1920,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,JUL,2005,47,7,501,506,10.1007/s00234-005-1372-x,6,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",947NR,WOS:000230653400002,15973537,02/05/2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.191780822,"['positron-emission-tomography', 'functional mri', 'cognition', 'brain injury', 'stroop task', 'anterior cingulate cortex', 'closed']",,,,,,,,,cognition,,,,

Diffusion tensor (DT) sequences may be analyzed with combined volume analysis and tractography extraction software, giving indirect visualization of white matter connections. We obtained DT data from 20 subjects with normal MR imaging and five patients presenting cerebral diseases such as brain tumors, multiple sclerosis and stroke, with five patients explored on two different MR scanners. Data were transferred to dedicated workstations for anatomical realignment, determination of voxel eigenvectors and calculation of fiber tract orientations in a region of interest. In all subjects, axonal directions underlying the main neuronal pathways could be delineated. Comparisons between diseased regions and contralateral areas demonstrated changes in voxel anisotropy in injured regions, revealing possible preferential fiber orientations within diffuse T2 hyperintensities. Rapid data processing allows imaging of the normal and diseased fiber pathways as part of the routine MRI examination. Therefore, it appears that whenever white matter disease is suspected a tractography can be performed with this fast and simple method that we proved to be reliable and reproducible.","CHNO XVXX, Serv Neuroimagerie, F-75012 Paris, France.","Nguyen, T (reprint author), CHNO XVXX, Serv Neuroimagerie, 28 Rue Charenton, F-75012 Paris, France.",thnguyenfr@yahoo.fr,31,25,28,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,MAY,2005,47,5,334,343,10.1007/s00234-005-1338-z,10,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",966KJ,WOS:000232018300005,15838688,02/05/2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.191780822,"['white-matter tractography', 'human brain', 'diffusion tensor', 'weighted mr', 'stroke', 'visual cortex', 'mri', 'optic tracts', 'white matter']",,,,,,,,,stroke,wm,,,

Reduced resting global cerebral blood flow has been previously detected in association with heart failure (HF), but it is not clear whether there are brain regions that could be specifically affected by those brain perfusion deficits. The authors used a fully automated, voxel-based image analysis method to investigate, across the entire cerebral volume, the presence of resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities in HF patients compared to healthy controls. Methods. rCBF was evaluated with Tc-99m-single-photon emission computed tomography in 17 HF patients (New York Heart Association functional class II or III) and 18 elderly healthy volunteers. Voxel-based analyses of rCBF data were conducted using the statistical parametric mapping software. Results. Significant rCBF reductions in HF patients relative to controls (P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons) were detected in 2 foci, encompassing, respectively, the left and right precuneus and cuneus and the right lateral temporoparietal cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus. In the HF group, there was also a significant direct correlation between the degree of cognitive impairment as assessed using the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination and rCBF on a voxel cluster involving the right posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, located closely to the site where between-group rCBF differences had been identified. Conclusions. These preliminary findings indicate that posterior cortical areas of the brain may be particularly vulnerable to brain perfusion reductions associated with HF and suggest that functional deficits in these regions might be relevant to the pathophysiology of the cognitive impairments presented by HF patients.","Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Sao Paulo, Brazil.","Alves, TCTF (reprint author), Hosp Clin FMUSP, Ctr Med Nucl, Rua Dr Ovidio Pires Campos S-N 3,Andar, BR-05403010 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",ferrazalves@aol.com,27,82,86,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-2284,1552-6569,J NEUROIMAGING,J.

Pyogenic and tuberculous spondylitis can mimic malignancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in differentiating spinal infection and malignancy. Methods. Fifty-one consecutive patients with suspected spinal infection or malignancy were enrolled in the study. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of paraspinal soft tissue mass and normal and abnormal vertebral bone marrow were determined on the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images of the spine. The mean ADCs of normal and abnormal vertebral bodies in patients with confirmed infection or malignancy were compared using nonparametric tests. Results. ADCs of 69 tuberculous, 9 pyogenic, and 50 malignant vertebral marrow lesions were significantly higher than ADCs of normal marrow. ADCs of malignant bone marrow and 5 paraspinal soft tissue lesions were significantly lower than tuberculosis and pyogenic infection. There was no significant difference between the ADCs of 44 adult and 25 pediatric tuberculous bone lesions or between tuberculosis and pyogenic infection. Using the cutoff ADC of 1.02 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s for bone marrow, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 60.26%, 66.00%, and 62.50%, respectively, for distinguishing infection from malignancy. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy increased to 94.12%, 82.35%, and 90.20%, respectively, when the ADCs of associated soft tissue lesions were higher than 1.17 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s. Conclusions.

The dissections occurred in the vertebral artery in 19 patients, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery ( PICA) in two patients, the basilar artery in four patients, and in the vertebral artery extending into the PICA in four patients. A pseudoaneurysm was found in 20 patients. Clinical manifestations typically included sudden onset of moderate to severe headache, nuchal rigidity, and drowsiness. Fourteen patients were treated conservatively. Fifteen patients underwent endovascular treatment with either parent artery occlusion ( 13 patients) or aneurysmal coil occlusion with preservation of the parent artery ( 2 patients). Re-bleeding occurred within 12 days and before treatment in nine patients. Eight of these had a pseudoaneurysm. No patient bled after endovascular treatment. Poor grade and early re-bleeding were associated with less favorable outcome. Outcome at 6 months did not differ significantly between endovascular and conservative treatment. Altogether, good recovery was achieved for 16 patients, moderate disability was seen in one, severe disability in four, and eight patients ( 27%) died. The absence of bleeding subsequent to endovascular treatment in this study suggests that endovascular treatment may be a rational approach in these patients at high risk of re-bleeding, especially those with a pseudoaneurysm.","Univ Lund Hosp, Ctr Med Imaging & Physiol, Dept Neuroradiol, S-22185 Lund, Sweden.","Ramgren, B (reprint author), Univ Lund Hosp, Ctr Med Imaging & Physiol, Dept Neuroradiol, S-22185 Lund, Sweden.",birgitta.ramgren@skane.se,32,63,67,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,FEB,2005,47,2,97,104,10.1007/s00234-005-1346-z,8,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",905KR,WOS:000227567500002,15711986,02/05/2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.191780822,"['dissection', 'vertebrobasilar arteries', 'subarachnoid hemorrhage', 'posteroinferior cerebellar artery', 'intracranial vertebral artery']",,,,,,,,,hemorrhage,,,,

Previous studies have shown that calcification in the coronary arteries correlates with significant vessel stenosis, and severe calcification ( measured by CT) in the carotid siphon correlates with significant ( greater than 50% stenosis) as determined angiographically. Sixty-one patients ( age range 50-85 years) underwent CT of the neck with intravenous administration of iodinated contrast for a variety of conditions. Images were obtained with a helical multidetector array CT scanner and reviewed on a three-dimensional workstation. A single observer manipulated window and level to segment calcified plaque from vascular enhancement in order to quantify vascular calcium volume ( cc) in the region of the bifurcation of the common carotid artery/ICA origin, and to measure the extent of ICA stenosis near the origin. A total of 117 common carotid artery bifurcations were reviewed. A ""significant'' stenosis was defined arbitrarily as > 40% ( to detect lesions before they become hemodynamically significant) of luminal diameter on CTA using NASCET-like criteria. All ""significant'' stenoses ( 21 out of 117 carotid bifurcations) had measurable calcium. We found a relatively strong correlation between percent stenosis and the calcium volume (Pearson's r = 0.65, P < 0.0001). We also found that there was an even stronger correlation between the square root of the calcium volume and the percent stenosis as measured by CTA (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001). Calcium volumes of 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 cc were used as thresholds to evaluate for a ""significant'' stenosis. A receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve demonstrated that thresholds of 0.06 cc ( sensitivity 88%, specificity 87%) and 0.03 cc ( sensitivity 94%, specificity 76%) generated the best combinations of sensitivity and speci. city. Hence, this preliminary study demonstrates a relatively strong relationship between volume of calcium at the carotid bifurcation in the neck ( measured by CT) and percent stenosis of the ICA below the skull base ( as measured by CTA). Use of calcium volume measurements as a threshold may be both sensitive and speci. c for the detection of significant ICA stenosis. The significance of the correlation between calcium volume and ICA stenosis is that potentially a ""score'' can be obtained that will identify those at risk for high grade carotid stenosis.","Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.","McKinney, A (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",mckin022@umn.edu,28,42,48,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-3940,,NEURORADIOLOGY,Neuroradiology,JAN,2005,47,1,1,9,10.1007/s00234-004-1301-4,9,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",895WR,WOS:000226895200001,15650832,02/05/2020,,"Lucato, Leandro T/0000-0001-9181-5245; Lucato, Leandro",,,,"Lucato, Leandro T/D-2239-2013; Lucato, Leandro Tavares/AAF-4744-2020",,,41st Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Neuroradiology,"APR 28-MAY 02, 2003","WASHINGTON, DC",Amer Soc Neuroradiol,2.054794521,"['calcification', 'computed tomography (ct)', 'ct', 'carotid arteries', 'digital-subtraction-angiography', 'magnetic-resonance angiography', 'calcium']",,,,,,,,,no,,,,
