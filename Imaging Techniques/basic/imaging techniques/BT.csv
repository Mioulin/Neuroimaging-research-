0,0,"Purpose: To investigate whether it is possible in patients with peri-ventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) to detect abnormal fiber projections that have only previously been reported in the histopathology literature. Materials and Methods: Whole-brain diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging data from 14 patients with bilateral PVNH and 14 age-and sex-matched healthy control subjects were prospectively acquired by using 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging between August 1, 2008, and December 5, 2012. All participants provided written informed consent. The DW imaging data were processed to generate whole-brain constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based tractography data and super-resolution track-density imaging (TDI) maps. The tractography data were overlaid on coregistered three-dimensional T1-weighted images to visually assess regions of heterotopia. A panel of MR imaging researchers independently assessed each case and indicated numerically (no = 1, yes = 2) as to the presence of abnormal fiber tracks in nodular tissue. The Fleiss kappa statistical measure was applied to assess the reader agreement. Results: Abnormal fiber tracks emanating from one or more regions of heterotopia were reported by all four readers in all 14 patients with PVNH (Fleiss kappa = 1). These abnormal structures were not visible on the tractography data from any of the control subjects and were not discernable on the conventional T1-weighted images of the patients with PVNH. Conclusion: Whole-brain CSD-based fiber tractography and super-resolution TDI mapping reveals abnormal fiber projections in nodular tissue suggestive of abnormal organization of white matter (with abnormal fibers both within nodules and projecting to the surrounding white matter) in patients with bilateral PVNH.

3,3,"Suicidal vulnerability has been related to impaired value-based decision-making and increased sensitivity to social threat, mediated by the prefrontal cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we aimed at replicating these previous findings by measuring brain activation during the Iowa Gambling Task and an emotional faces viewing task. Participants comprised 15 euthymic suicide attempters (history of depression and suicidal behavior) who were compared with 23 euthymic patient controls (history of depression without suicidal history) and 35 healthy controls. The following five model-based regions of interest were investigated: the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial (MPFC) and dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC). Suicide attempters relative to patient controls showed (1) increased response to angry vs. neutral faces in the left OFC and the VLPFC, as previously reported; (2) increased response to wins vs. losses in the right OFC, DPFC and ACC; (3) decreased response to risky vs. safe choices in the left DPFC; and (4) decreased response to sad vs. neutral faces in the right ACC. This study links impaired valuation processing (here for signals of social threat, sadness and reward) to prefrontal cortex dysfunction in suicide attempters. These long-term deficits may underlie the impaired decision-making and social difficulties found in suicide attempters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

4,4,"Objective: To use a multimodal approach to assess brain structural pathways and resting state (RS) functional connectivity abnormalities in patients with Parkinson's disease and freezing of gait (PD-FoG). Methods: T1-weighted, diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and RS functional MRI (fMRI) were obtained from 22 PD-FoG patients and 35 controls on a 3.0 T MR scanner. Patients underwent clinical, motor, and neuropsychological evaluations. Gray matter (GM) volumes and white matter (WM) damage were assessed using voxel based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics, respectively. The pedunculopontine tract (PPT) was studied using tractography. RS fMRI data were analyzed using a model free approach investigating the main sensorimotor and cognitive brain networks. Multiple regression models were performed to assess the relationships between structural, functional, and clinical/cognitive variables. Analysis of GM and WM structural abnormalities was replicated in an independent sample including 28 PD-FoG patients, 25 PD patients without FoG, and 30 healthy controls who performed MRI scans on a 1.5 T scanner. Results: Compared with controls, no GM atrophy was found in PD-FoG cases. PD-FoG patients showed WM damage of the PPT, corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and WM underneath the primary motor, premotor, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and inferior parietal cortices, bilaterally. In PD-FoG, right PTT damage was associated with a greater disease severity. Analysis on the independent PD sample showed similar findings in PD-FoG patients relative to controls as well as WM damage of the genu and body of the corpus callosum and right parietal WM in PD-FoG relative to PD no-FoG patients. RS fMRI analysis showed that PD-FoG is associated with a decreased functional connectivity of the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area bilaterally in the sensorimotor network, frontoparietal regions in the default mode network, and occipital cortex in the visual associative network. Conclusions: This study suggests that FoG in PD can be the result of a poor structural and functional integration between motor and extramotor (cognitive) neural systems.

5,5,"This meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) study explores the functional connectivity of the cerebellum with the cerebrum in social cognitive processes. In a recent meta-analysis, Van Over-walle, Baetens, Marien, and Vandekerckhove (2014) documented that the cerebellum is implicated in social processes of ""body"" reading (mirroring; e.g., understanding other persons' intentions from observing their movements) and ""mind"" reading (mentalizing, e.g., inferring other persons' beliefs, intentions or personality traits, reconstructing persons' past, future, or hypothetical events). In a recent functional connectivity study, Buckner et al. (2011) offered a novel parcellation of cerebellar topography that substantially overlaps with the cerebellar meta-analytic findings of Van Overwalle et al. (2014). This overlap suggests that the involvement of the cerebellum in social reasoning depends on its functional connectivity with the cerebrum. To test this hypothesis, we explored the meta-analytic co-activations as indices of functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the cerebrum during social cognition. The MACM results confirm substantial and distinct connectivity with respect to the functions of (a) action understanding (""body"" reading) and (b) mentalizing (""mind"" reading). The consistent and strong connectivity findings of this analysis suggest that cerebellar activity during social judgments reflects distinct mirroring and mentalizing functionality, and that these cerebellar functions are connected with corresponding functional networks in the cerebrum.

6,6,"The use of resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) in translational research is a powerful tool to assess brain connectivity and investigate neuropathology in mouse models. However, despite encouraging initial results, the characterization of consistent and robust resting state networks in mice remains a methodological challenge. One key reason is that the quality of the measured MR signal is degraded by the presence of structural noise from non-neural sources. Notably, in the current pipeline of the Human Connectome Project, a novel approach has been introduced to clean rs-fMRI data, which involves automatic artifact component classification and data cleaning (FIX). FIX does not require any external recordings of physiology or the segmentation of CSF and white matter. In this study, we evaluated the performance of FIX for analyzing mouse rs-fMRI data. Our results showed that FIX can be easily applied to mouse datasets and detects true signals with 100% accuracy and true noise components with very high accuracy (>98%), thus reducing both within-and between-subject variability of rs-fMRI connectivity measurements. Using this improved pre-processing pipeline, maps of 23 resting state circuits in mice were identified including two networks that displayed default mode network-like topography. Hierarchical clustering grouped these neural networks into meaningful larger functional circuits.

7,7,"Under weak and reasonable assumptions, mainly that data are exchangeable under the null hypothesis, permutation tests can provide exact control of false positives and allow the use of various non-standard statistics. There are, however, various common examples in which global exchangeability can be violated, including paired tests, tests that involve repeated measurements, tests in which subjects are relatives (members of pedigrees) - any dataset with known dependence among observations. In these cases, some permutations, if performed, would create data that would not possess the original dependence structure, and thus, should not be used to construct the reference (null) distribution. To allow permutation inference in such cases, we test the null hypothesis using only a subset of all otherwise possible permutations, i.e., using only the rearrangements of the data that respect exchangeability, thus retaining the original joint distribution unaltered. In a previous study, we defined exchangeability for blocks of data, as opposed to each datum individually, then allowing permutations to happen within block, or the blocks as a whole to be permuted. Here we extend that notion to allow blocks to be nested, in a hierarchical, multi-level definition. We do not explicitly model the degree of dependence between observations, only the lack of independence; the dependence is implicitly accounted for by the hierarchy and by the permutation scheme. The strategy is compatible with heteroscedasticity and variance groups, and can be used with permutations, sign flippings, or both combined. We evaluate the method for various dependence structures, apply it to real data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) as an example application, show that false positives can be avoided in such cases, and provide a software implementation of the proposed approach.

8,8,"Initially described as task-induced deactivations during goal-directed paradigms of high attentional load, the unresolved functionality of default mode regions has long been assumed to interfere with task performance. However, recent evidence suggests a potential default mode network involvement in fulfilling cognitive demands. We tested this hypothesis in a finger opposition paradigm with task and fixation periods which we compared with an independent resting state scan using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a comprehensive analysis pipeline including activation, functional connectivity, behavioural and graph theoretical assessments. The results indicate task specific changes in the default mode network topography. Behaviourally, we show that increased connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex with the left superior frontal gyrus predicts faster reaction times. Moreover, interactive and dynamic reconfiguration of the default mode network regions' functional connections illustrates their involvement with the task at hand with higher-level global parallel processing power, yet preserved small-world architecture in comparison with rest. These findings demonstrate that the default mode network does not disengage during this paradigm, but instead may be involved in task relevant processing. (C) 2015 The Authors.

9,9,"The examination of functional connectivity in fMRI data collected during task-free ""rest"" has provided a powerful tool for studying functional brain organization. Limitations of this approach include susceptibility to head motion artifacts and participant drowsiness or sleep. These issues are especially relevant when studying young children or clinical populations. Here we introduce a movie paradigm, Inscapes, that features abstract shapes without a narrative or scene-cuts. The movie was designed to provide enough stimulation to improve compliance related to motion and wakefulness while minimizing cognitive load during the collection of functional imaging data. We compare Inscapes to eyes-open rest and to age-appropriate movie clips in healthy adults (Ocean's Eleven, n = 22) and a pilot sample of typically developing children ages 3-7 (Fantasia, n = 13). Head motion was significantly lower during both movies relative to rest for both groups. In adults, movies decreased the number of participants who self-reported sleep. Intersubject correlations, used to quantify synchronized, task-evoked activity across movie and rest conditions in adults, involved less cortex during Inscapes than Ocean's Eleven. To evaluate the effect of movie-watching on intrinsic functional connectivity networks, we examined mean functional connectivity using both whole-brain functional parcellation and network-based approaches. Both inter-and intra-network metrics were more similar between Inscapes and Rest than between Ocean's Eleven and Rest, particularly in comparisons involving the default network. When comparing movies to Rest, the mean functional connectivity of somatomotor, visual and ventral attention networks differed significantly across various analyses. We conclude that low-demand movies like Inscapes may represent a useful intermediate condition between task-free rest and typical narrative movies while still improving participant compliance. Inscapes is publicly available for download at headspacestudios.org/inscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has been done to differentiate these three disorders or to investigate the distinction of SAD as an independent category using fMRI data. This study is aimed to explore biomarkers from resting-state fMRI networks for differentiating these disorders and investigate the relationship among these disorders based on fMRI networks with an emphasis on SAD. Firstly, a novel group ICA method, group information guided independent component analysis (GIG-ICA), was applied to extract subject-specific brain networks from fMRI data of 20 healthy controls (HC), 20 SZ patients, 20 BP patients, 20 patients suffering from SAD with manic episodes (SADM), and 13 patients suffering from SAD with depressive episodes exclusively (SADD). Then, five-level one-way analysis of covariance and multiclass support vector machine recursive feature elimination were employed to identify discriminative regions from the networks. Subsequently, the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) projection and the hierarchical clustering were implemented to investigate the relationship among those groups. Finally, to evaluate the generalization ability, 16 new subjects were classified based on the found regions and the trained model using original 93 subjects. Results show that the discriminative regions mainly included frontal, parietal, precuneus, cingulate, supplementary motor, cerebellar, insula and supramarginal cortices, which performed well in distinguishing different groups. SADM and SADD were the most similar to each other, although SADD had greater similarity to SZ compared to other groups, which indicates that SAD may be an independent category.

12,12,"Functional connectivity provides an informative and powerful framework for exploring brain organization. Despite this, few statistical methods are available for the accurate estimation of dynamic changes in functional network architecture. To date, the majority of existing statistical techniques have assumed that connectivity structure is stationary, which is in direct contrast to emerging data that suggests that the strength of connectivity between regions is variable over time. Therefore, the development of statistical methods that enable exploration of dynamic changes in functional connectivity is currently of great importance to the neuroscience community. In this paper, we introduce the 'Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives' (MTD) and then demonstrate the utility of this metric to: (i) detect dynamic changes in connectivity using data from a novel state-switching simulation; (ii) accurately estimate graph structure in a previously-described 'ground-truth' simulated dataset; and (iii) identify task-driven alterations in functional connectivity. We show that theMTD is more sensitive than existing sliding-window methods in detecting dynamic alterations in connectivity structure across a range of correlation strengths and window lengths in simulated data. In addition to the temporal precision offered by MTD, we demonstrate that the metric is also able to accurately estimate stationary network structure in both simulated and real task-based data, suggesting that the method may be used to identify dynamic changes in network structure as they evolve through time.

However, literature on the association between resting state brain functional connectivity, as studied using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), and reported anxiety levels in the sub-clinical population is limited. In the present study, we employed rs-fMRI to investigate the possible alterations in the functional integrity of Resting State Networks (RSNs) associated with trait anxiety of the healthy subjects (15 high anxious and 14 low anxious). The rs-fMRI data was analyzed using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach that was applied on 12 RSNs that were identified using FSL. High anxious subjects showed significantly reduced functional connectivity in regions of the default mode network (posterior cingulate gyrus, middle and superior temporal gyms, planum polare, supramarginal gyms, temporal pole, angular gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus) which has been suggested to be involved in episodic memory, theory of mind, self-evaluation, and introspection, and perceptual systems including medial visual network, auditory network and another network involving temporal, parieto-occipital and frontal regions. Reduction in resting state connectivity in regions of the perceptual networks might underlie the perceptual, attentional and working memory deficits associated with trait anxiety.

14,14,"Stable neuropsychological deficits may provide a reliable basis for identifying etiological subtypes of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to identify clusters of individuals with schizophrenia based on dimensions of neuropsychological performance, and to characterize their neural correlates. We acquired neuropsychological data as well as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging from 129 patients with schizophrenia and 165 healthy controls. We derived eight cognitive dimensions and subsequently applied a cluster analysis to identify possible schizophrenia subtypes. Analyses suggested the following four cognitive clusters of schizophrenia: (1) Diminished Verbal Fluency, (2) Diminished Verbal Memory and Poor Motor Control, (3) Diminished Face Memory and Slowed Processing, and (4) Diminished Intellectual Function. The clusters were characterized by a specific pattern of structural brain changes in areas such as Wernicke's area, lingual gyms and occipital face area, and hippocampus as well as differences in working memory-elicited neural activity in several fronto-parietal brain regions. Separable measures of cognitive function appear to provide a method for deriving cognitive subtypes meaningfully related to brain structure and function. Because the present study identified brain-based neural correlates of the cognitive clusters, the proposed groups of individuals with schizophrenia have some external validity.

15,15,"Many approaches for estimating functional connectivity among brain regions or networks in fMRI have been considered in the literature. More recently, studies have shown that connectivity which is usually estimated by calculating correlation between time series or by estimating coherence as a function of frequency has a dynamic nature, during both task and resting conditions. Sliding-window methods have been commonly used to study these dynamic properties although other approaches such as instantaneous phase synchronization have also been used for similar purposes. Some studies have also suggested that spectral analysis can be used to separate the distinct contributions of motion, respiration and neurophysiological activity from the observed correlation. Several recent studies have merged analysis of coherence with study of temporal dynamics of functional connectivity though these have mostly been limited to a few selected brain regions and frequency bands. Here we propose a novel data-driven framework to estimate time-varying patterns of whole-brain functional network connectivity of resting state fMRI combined with the different frequencies and phase lags at which these patterns are observed. We show that this analysis identifies both broad-band cluster centroids that summarize connectivity patterns observed in many frequency bands, as well as clusters consisting only of functional network connectivity (FNC) from a narrow range of frequencies along with associated phase profiles. The value of this approach is demonstrated by its ability to reveal significant group differences in males versus females regarding occupancy rates of cluster that would not be separable without considering the frequencies and phase lags. The method we introduce provides a novel and informative framework for analyzing time-varying and frequency specific connectivity which can be broadly applied to the study of the healthy and diseased human brain.

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated age-related microstructural changes in specific white matter tracts during development and aging. However, the age-related alterations in the topological architecture of the white matter structural connectome across the human lifespan remain largely unknown. Here, a cohort of 113 healthy individuals (ages 9-85) with both diffusion and structural MRI acquisitions were examined. For each participant, the high-resolution white matter structural networks were constructed by deterministic fiber tractography among 1024 parcellation units and were quantified with graph theoretical analyses. The global network properties, including network strength, cost, topological efficiency, and robustness, followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory with a peak age around the third decade. The brain areas with the most significantly nonlinear changes were located in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Different brain regions exhibited heterogeneous trajectories: the posterior cingulate and lateral temporal cortices displayed prolonged maturation/degeneration compared with the prefrontal cortices. Rich-club organization was evident across the lifespan, whereas hub integration decreased linearly with age, especially accompanied by the loss of frontal hubs and their connections. Additionally, age-related changes in structural connections were predominantly located within and between the prefrontal and temporal modules. Finally, based on the graph metrics of structural connectome, accurate predictions of individual age were obtained (r=0.77).

18,18,"In this study, we used invasive tracing to evaluate white matter tractography methods based on ex vivo diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dwMRI) data. A representative selection of tractography methods were compared to manganese tracing on a voxel-wise basis, and a more qualitative assessment examined whether, and to what extent, certain fiber tracts and gray matter targets were reached. While the voxel-wise agreement was very limited, qualitative assessment revealed that tractography is capable of finding the major fiber tracts, although there were some differences between the methods. However, false positive connections were very common and, in particular, we discovered that it is not possible to achieve high sensitivity (i.e., few false negatives) and high specificity (i.e., few false positives) at the same time. Closer inspection of the results led to the conclusion that these problems mainly originate from regions with complex fiber arrangements or high curvature and are not easily resolved by sophisticated local models alone. Instead, the crucial challenge in making tractography a truly useful and reliable tool in brain research and neurology lies in the acquisition of better data. In particular, the increase of spatial resolution, under preservation of the signal-to-noise-ratio, is key.

Here, we performed the largest diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study of incarcerated criminal offenders to date (N=147) to determine whether psychopathy severity is linked to the microstructural integrity of major white matter tracts in the brain. Consistent with the results of previous studies in smaller samples, we found that psychopathy was associated with reduced fractional anisotropy in the right uncinate fasciculus (UF; the major white matter tract connecting ventral frontal and anterior temporal cortices). We found no such association in the left UF or in adjacent frontal or temporal white matter tracts. Moreover, the right UF finding was specifically related to the interpersonal features of psychopathy (glib superficial charm, grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological lying, manipulativeness), rather than the affective, antisocial, or lifestyle features. These results indicate a neural marker for this key dimension of psychopathic symptomatology.

However there is currently no standardized localization procedure to reliably identify specific areas across individuals such as the standard 'localizers' available in the visual domain. Here we present an fMRI 'voice localizer' scan allowing rapid and reliable localization of the voice-sensitive 'temporal voice areas' (TVA) of human auditory cortex. We describe results obtained using this standardized localizer scan in a large cohort of normal adult subjects. Most participants (94%) showed bilateral patches of significantly greater response to vocal than nonvocal sounds along the superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (STS/STG). Individual activation patterns, although reproducible, showed high inter-individual variability in precise anatomical location. Cluster analysis of individual peaks from the large cohort highlighted three bilateral clusters of voice-sensitivity, or ""voice patches"" along posterior (TVAp), mid (TVAm) and anterior (TVAa) STS/STG, respectively. A series of extra-temporal areas including bilateral inferior prefrontal cortex and amygdalae showed small, but reliable voice-sensitivity as part of a large-scale cerebral voice network.

21,21,"Stress is present in everyday life in various forms and situations. Two stressors frequently investigated are physiological and psychosocial stress. Besides similar subjective and hormonal responses, it has been suggested that they also share common neural substrates. The current study used activation-likelihood-estimation metaanalysis to test this assumption by integrating results of previous neuroimaging studies on stress processing. Reported results are cluster-level FWE corrected. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the anterior insula (AI) were the only regions that demonstrated overlapping activation for both stressors. Analysis of physiological stress showed consistent activation of cognitive and affective components of pain processing such as the insula, striatum, or the middle cingulate cortex. Contrarily, analysis across psychosocial stress revealed consistent activation of the right superior temporal gyrus and deactivation of the striatum. Notably, parts of the striatum appeared to be functionally specified: the dorsal striatum was activated in physiological stress, whereas the ventral striatum was deactivated in psychosocial stress. Additional functional connectivity and decoding analyses further characterized this functional heterogeneity and revealed higher associations of the dorsal striatum with motor regions and of the ventral striatum with reward processing. Based on our meta-analytic approach, activation of the IFG and the AI seems to indicate a global neural stress reaction. While physiological stress activates amotoric fight-or-flight reaction, during psychosocial stress attention is shifted towards emotion regulation and goal-directed behavior, and reward processing is reduced. Our results showthe significance of differentiating physiological and psychosocial stress in neural engagement. Furthermore, the assessment of deactivations in addition to activations in stress research is highly recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to establish trait-related subcortical volumetric and shape abnormalities in a large, homogeneous sample of prospectively confirmed euthymic bipolar I disorder (BD-I) patients (n=60), compared with healthy volunteers (n=60). Participants were individually matched for age and gender. Volume and shape metrics were derived from manually segmented S-MR images for the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, and lateral ventricles. Group differences were analysed, controlling for age, gender and intracranial volume. BD-I patients displayed significantly smaller left hippocampal volumes and significantly larger left lateral ventricle volumes compared with controls. Shape analysis revealed an area of contraction in the anterior head and medial border of the left hippocampus, as well as expansion in the right hippocampal tail medially, in patients compared with controls. There were no significant associations between volume or shape variation and lithium status or duration of use A reduction in the head of the left hippocampus in BD-I patients is interesting, given this region's link to verbal memory.

24,24,"Evidence is heterogeneous regarding whether patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) display disturbed emotional inhibition in the emotional Stroop task. Previous findings suggest that state dissociation may influence cognitive inhibition of task-irrelevant material, particularly with negative content. Our aim was to examine performance in an emotional Stroop task including negative, neutral, and positive words in BPD patients and healthy controls during functional magnetic resonance imaging. In advance, half of the BPD patients underwent a dissociation induction using script-driven imagery. BPD patients without dissociation induction showed behavioural performance comparable to that of healthy controls but displayed stronger neural responses, especially to positive stimuli, in the superior temporal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. BPD patients with dissociation induction showed overall slower and less accurate responses as well as increased reaction times for negative versus neutral words compared with BPD patients without dissociation induction. Moreover, they showed comparatively decreased neuronal activity in the fusiform gyrus and parietal cortices independent of valence, but elevated activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus in response to negative versus neutral words. In conclusion, experimentally induced dissociation in BPD was associated with inefficient cognitive inhibition, particularly of negative stimuli, in the emotional Stroop task.

Given the phenotypical heterogeneity among individuals showing antisocial behavior, specification of the association between structural connectivity and the dimensions of psychopathic traits (i.e., callous unemotional, grandiose manipulative, and impulsive irresponsible traits) may aid in more reliably elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying antisocial behavior during adolescence. In this study, a sample of 145 adolescents (mean age 17.6, SD 1.6) from a childhood arrestee cohort participated in a neuroimaging protocol including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD), as obtained by tract based spatial statistics, were associated with juveniles' scores on the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory. Grandiose manipulative traits were positively associated with FA and negatively with RD in a wide range of white matter tracts, suggesting abnormal myelination related to these traits. Callous-unemotional traits were positively associated with FA and AD in specific white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract. The differential associations between dimensions of psychopathic traits and measures of structural connectivity support the notion that multiple distinct neural mechanisms underlie antisocial and psychopathic development.

26,26,"We investigated fluctuations in brain volume throughout the day using statistical modeling of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from large populations. We applied fully automated image analysis software to measure the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), defined as the ratio of the brain parenchymal volume and intracranial volume, thus accounting for variations in head size. The MRI data came from serial scans of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in clinical trials (n = 755, 3269 scans) and from subjects participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 834, 6114 scans). The percent change in BPF was modeled with a linear mixed effect (LME) model, and the model was applied separately to the MS and ADNI datasets. The LME model for the MS datasets included random subject effects (intercept and slope over time) and fixed effects for the time-of-day, time from the baseline scan, and trial, which accounted for trial-related effects (for example, different inclusion criteria and imaging protocol). The model for ADNI additionally included the demographics (baseline age, sex, subject type [ normal, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease], and interaction between subject type and time from baseline). There was a statistically significant effect of time-of-day on the BPF change in MS clinical trial datasets (-0.180 per day, that is, 0.180% of intracranial volume, p=0.019) as well as the ADNI dataset (-0.438 per day, that is, 0.438% of intracranial volume, p < 0.0001), showing that the brain volume is greater in the morning. Linearly correcting the BPF values with the time-of-day reduced the required sample size to detect a 25% treatment effect (80% power and 0.05 significance level) on change in brain volume from 2 time-points over a period of 1 year by 2.6%. Our results have significant implications for future brain volumetric studies, suggesting that there is a potential acquisition time bias that should be randomized or statistically controlled to account for the day-to-day brain volume fluctuations.

27,27,"The large-scale organization of the brain has features of complex networks that can be quantified using network measures from graph theory. However, many network measures were designed to be calculated on binary graphs, whereas functional brain organization is typically inferred from a continuous measure of correlations in temporal signal between brain regions. Thresholding is a necessary step to use binary graphs derived from functional connectivity data. However, there is no current consensus on what threshold to use, and network measures and group contrasts may be unstable across thresholds. Nevertheless, whole-brain network analyses are being applied widely with findings typically reported at an arbitrary threshold or range of thresholds. This study sought to evaluate the stability of network measures across thresholds in a large resting state functional connectivity dataset. Network measures were evaluated across absolute (correlation-based) and proportional (sparsity-based) thresholds, and compared between sex and age groups. Overall, network measures were found to be unstable across absolute thresholds. For example, the direction of group differences in a given network measure may change depending on the threshold. Network measures were found to be more stable across proportional thresholds. These results demonstrate that caution should be used when applying thresholds to functional connectivity data and when interpreting results from binary graph models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the approved subjects, reliability of cortical thickness/surface area/volume (DK atlas only) were: TRC (0.82/0.88/0.88), ICC (0.81/0.87/0.88), PD (0.86/1.19/1.39), which represent a significant improvement over these measures when disapproved subjects are included. Travel subjects' results show that cortical thickness reliability is more sensitive to site differences than the cortical surface area and volume. To determine the effect of visual inspection on sample size required for studies of MRI-derived cortical thickness, the number of subjects required to show group differences was calculated. Significant differences observed across imaging sites, between visually approved/disapproved subjects, and across regions with different sizes suggest that these measures should be used with caution.

30,30,"Creativity, a multifaceted construct, can be studied in various ways, for example, investigating phases of the creative process, quality of the creative product, or the impact of expertise. Previous neuroimaging studies have assessed these individually. Believing that each of these interacting features must be examined simultaneously to develop a comprehensive understanding of creative behavior, we examined poetry composition, assessing process, product, and expertise in a single experiment. Distinct activation patterns were associated with generation and revision, two major phases of the creative process. Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) was active during both phases, yet responses in dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal executive systems (DLPFC/IPS) were phase-dependent, indicating that while motivation remains unchanged, cognitive control is attenuated during generation and re-engaged during revision. Experts showed significantly stronger deactivation of DLPFC/IPS during generation, suggesting that they may more effectively suspend cognitive control. Importantly however, similar overall patterns were observed in both groups, indicating the same cognitive resources are available to experts and novices alike. Quality of poetry, assessed by an independent panel, was associated with divergent connectivity patterns in experts and novices, centered upon MPFC (for technical facility) and DLPFC/IPS (for innovation), suggesting a mechanism by which experts produce higher quality poetry. Crucially, each of these three key features can be understood in the context of a single neurocognitive model characterized by dynamic interactions between medial prefrontal areas regulating motivation, dorsolateral prefrontal, and parietal areas regulating cognitive control and the association of these regions with language, sensorimotor, limbic, and subcortical areas distributed throughout the brain.

31,31,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasingly understood as a disorder of spontaneous brain-network interactions. The default mode network (DMN), implicated in ADHD-linked behaviors including mind-wandering and attentional fluctuations, has been shown to exhibit abnormal spontaneous functional connectivity (FC) within-network and with other networks (salience, dorsal attention and frontoparietal) in ADHD. Although the cerebellum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ADHD, it remains unknown whether cerebellar areas of the DMN (CerDMN) exhibit altered FC with cortical networks in ADHD. Here, 23 adults with ADHD and 23 age-, IQ-, and sex-matched controls underwent resting state fMRI. The mean time series of CerDMN areas was extracted, and FC with the whole brain was calculated. Whole-brain between-group differences in FC were assessed. Additionally, relationships between inattention and individual differences in FC were assessed for between-group interactions. In ADHD, CerDMN areas showed positive FC (in contrast to average FC in the negative direction in controls) with widespread regions of salience, dorsal attention and sensorimotor networks. ADHD individuals also exhibited higher FC (more positive correlation) of CerDMN areas with frontoparietal and visual network regions. Within the control group, but not in ADHD, participants with higher inattention had higher FC between CerDMN and regions in the visual and dorsal attention networks. This work provides novel evidence of impaired CerDMN coupling with cortical networks in ADHD and highlights a role of cerebro-cerebellar interactions in cognitive function.

Recent studies of other neuropsychiatric disorders have used graph-based theoretical analysis to investigate the topological properties of the functional brain connectome. However, little is known about this connectome in pediatric PTSD. Twenty-eight pediatric PTSD patients and 26 trauma-exposed non-PTSD patients were recruited from 4,200 screened subjects after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake to undergo a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Functional connectivity between 90 brain regions from the automated anatomical labeling atlas was established using partial correlation coefficients, and the whole-brain functional connectome was constructed by applying a threshold to the resultant 90 * 90 partial correlation matrix. Graph theory analysis was then used to examine the group-specific topological properties of the two functional connectomes. Both the PTSD and non-PTSD control groups exhibited small-world brain network topology. However, the functional connectome of the PTSD group showed a significant increase in the clustering coefficient and a normalized characteristic path length and local efficiency, suggesting a shift toward regular networks. Furthermore, the PTSD connectomes showed both enhanced nodal centralities, mainly in the default mode- and salience-related regions, and reduced nodal centralities, mainly in the central-executive network regions. The clustering coefficient and nodal efficiency of the left superior frontal gyrus were positively correlated with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. These disrupted topological properties of the functional connectome help to clarify the pathogenesis of pediatric PTSD and could be potential biomarkers of brain abnormalities.

33,33,"Hippocampal volume has been shown to be sensitive to variations in estrogen and progesterone levels across rodents' estrous cycle. However, little is known about the covariation of hormone levels and brain structure in the course of the human menstrual cycle. Here, we examine this covariation with a multi-method approach that includes several brain imaging methods and hormonal assessments. We acquired structural and functional scans from 21 naturally cycling women on four time points during their cycles (early follicular phase, late follicular phase, ovulation and luteal phase). Hormone blood concentrations and cognitive performance in different domains were assessed on each of the measurement occasions. Structural MRI images were processed by means of whole-brain voxel-based morphometry and FreeSurfer. With either method, bilateral increases in hippocampal volume were found in the late follicular phase relative to the early follicular phase. The gray matter probability in regions of hippocampal volume increase was associated with lower mean diffusivity in the same region. In addition, we observed higher functional connectivity between the hippocampi and the bilateral superior parietal lobe in the late follicular phase. We did not find any reliable cycle-related performance variations on the cognitive tasks. The present results show that hormonal fluctuations covary with hippocampal structure and function in the course of the human menstrual cycle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

34,34,"The responsiveness to non-invasive neuromodulation protocols shows high inter-individual variability, the reasons of which remain poorly understood. We here tested whether the response to intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) - an effective repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocol for increasing cortical excitability - depends on network properties of the cortical motor system. We furthermore investigated whether the responsiveness to iTBS is dose-dependent. To this end, we used a sham-stimulation controlled, single-blinded within-subject design testing for the relationship between iTBS aftereffects and (i) motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as well as (ii) resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 16 healthy subjects. In each session, three blocks of iTBS were applied, separated by 15 min. We found that non-responders (subjects not showing an MEP increase of >= 10% after one iTBS block) featured stronger rsFC between the stimulated primary motor cortex (M1) and premotor areas before stimulation compared to responders. However, only the group of responders showed increases in rsFC and MEPs, while most non-responders remained close to baseline levels after all three blocks of iTBS. Importantly, there was still a large amount of variability in both groups. Our data suggest that responsiveness to iTBS at the local level (i.e., M1 excitability) depends upon the pre-interventional network connectivity of the stimulated region. Of note, increasing iTBS dose did not turn non-responders into responders. The finding that higher levels of pre-interventional connectivity precluded a response to iTBS could reflect a ceiling effect underlying non-responsiveness to iTBS at the systems level.

35,35,"Task based fMRI activation mapping has been widely used in clinical neuroscience in order to assess different functional activity patterns in conditions such as prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affected brains and healthy controls. In this paper, we propose a novel, alternative approach of group wise sparse representation of the fMRI data of multiple groups of subjects (healthy control, exposed non-dysmorphic PAE and exposed dysmorphic PAP) and assess the systematic functional activity differences among these three populations. Specifically, a common time series signal dictionary is learned from the aggregated fMRI signals of all three groups of subjects, and then the weight coefficient matrices (named statistical coefficient map (SCM)) associated with each common dictionary were statistically assessed for each group separately. Through inter group comparisons based on the correspondence established by the common dictionary, our experimental results have demonstrated that the group wise sparse coding strategy and the SCM can effectively reveal a collection of brain networks/regions that were affected by different levels of severity of RAE.

36,36,"Recent evidence demonstrates that hippocampal hyperactivity helps mediate psychosis. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rstiVIRl), we examined hippocampal connectivity alterations in individuals with psychosis (PS) versus healthy controls (HC). Because of its putative greater involvement in psychiatric disorders, we hypothesized that the anterior hippocampus network would show greater dysconnectivity in psychosis. We tested rsfMRl connectivity in 88 PS (including 21 with schizophrenia; 40 with schizoaffective disorder; 27 with psychotic bipolar l disorder) and 65 HC. Seedbased voxel-wise connectivity analyses were carried out using whole, anterior, and posterior hippocampal seeds. No significant differences in functional hippocampal connectivity were found across the three conventional diagnoses. PS were then contrasted with FiC, showing strong reductions in anterior hippocampal connectivity to anterior neocortical regions, including medial frontal and anterior cingulate cortices, as well as superior temporal gyrus, precuneus, thalamus and cerebellum. Posterior hippocampal seeds also demonstrated decreased connectivity in PS, with fewer dysconnected regions and a posterior/ cerebellar distribution. Whole hippocampal outcomes were consistent with anterior/posterior hippocampal connectivity changes. Connectivity alterations did not correlate with cognition, clinical symptoms, or medication effect variables. Our results suggest a psychosis network of decreased hippocampal connectivity with limbic and frontal contributions, independent of diagnostic categories. (C) 2015 Elsevier lreland Ltd.

However, previous findings of atypical brain activation during the stop-signal task in children with ADHD may be confounded with attentional processes, precluding strong conclusions on the nature of these deficits. In addition, there are recent concerns on the construct validity of the SSRT metric. The aim of this study was to control for confounding factors and improve the specificity of the stop-signal task to investigate inhibition mechanisms in children with ADHD. FMRI was used to measure inhibition related brain activation in 17 typically developing children (TD) and 21 children with ADHD, using a highly controlled version of the stop-signal task. Successful inhibition trials were contrasted with control trials that were comparable in frequency, visual presentation and absence of motor response. We found reduced brain activation in children with ADHD in key inhibition areas, including the right inferior frontal gyrusfinsula, and anterior cingulate/clorsal medial prefrontal cortex. Using a more stringent controlled design, this study replicated and specified previous findings of atypical brain activation in ADHD during motor response inhibition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

38,38,"Background: Declarative verbal learning and memory are known to be lateralised to the dominant hemisphere and to be subserved by a network of structures, including those located in frontal and temporal regions. These structures support critical components of verbal memory, including working memory, encoding, and retrieval. Their relative functional importance in facilitating declarative verbal learning and memory, however, remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the different functional roles of these structures in subserving declarative verbal learning and memory performance by applying a more focal form of transcranial direct current stimulation, ""High Definition tDCS"" (HD-tDCS). Additionally, we sought to examine HD-tDCS effects and electrical field intensity distributions using computer modelling. Methods: HD-tDCS was administered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC), planum temporale (PT), and left medial temporal lobe (LMTL) to stimulate the hippocampus, during learning on a declarative verbal memory task. Sixteen healthy participants completed a single blind, intra-individual cross-over, sham-controlled study which used a Latin Square experimental design. Cognitive effects on working memory and sustained attention were additionally examined. Results: HD-tDCS to the LDLPFC significantly improved the rate of verbal learning (p=0.03, eta(2)=0.29) and speed of responding during working memory performance (p=0.02, eta(2)=0.35), but not accuracy (p=0.12, eta(2)=0.16). No effect of tDCS on verbal learning, retention, or retrieval was found for stimulation targeted to the LMTL or the PT. Secondary analyses revealed that LMTL stimulation resulted in increased recency (p=0.02, eta(2)=0.31) and reduced mid-list learning effects (p=0.01, eta(2)=0.39), suggesting an inhibitory effect on learning. Conclusions: HD-tDCS to the LDLPFC facilitates the rate of verbal learning and improved efficiency of working memory may underlie performance effects. This focal method of administrating tDCS has potential for probing and enhancing cognitive functioning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

39,39,"In brain regions containing crossing fibre bundles, voxel-average diffusion MRI measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA) are difficult to interpret, and lack within-voxel single fibre population specificity. Recent work has focused on the development of more interpretable quantitative measures that can be associated with a specific fibre population within a voxel containing crossing fibres (herein we use fixel to refer to a specific fibre population within a single voxel). Unfortunately, traditional 3D methods for smoothing and cluster-based statistical inference cannot be used for voxel-based analysis of these measures, since the local neighbourhood for smoothing and cluster formation can be ambiguous when adjacent voxels may have different numbers of fixels, or ill-defined when they belong to different tracts. Here we introduce a novel statistical method to perform whole-brain fixel-based analysis called connectivity-based fixel enhancement (CFE). CFE uses probabilistic tractography to identify structurally connected fixels that are likely to share underlying anatomy and pathology. Probabilistic connectivity information is then used for tract-specific smoothing (prior to the statistical analysis) and enhancement of the statistical map (using a threshold-free cluster enhancement-like approach). To investigate the characteristics of the CFE method, we assessed sensitivity and specificity using a large number of combinations of CFE enhancement parameters and smoothing extents, using simulated pathology generated with a range of test-statistic signal-to-noise ratios in five different white matter regions (chosen to cover a broad range of fibre bundle features). The results suggest that CFE input parameters are relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the simulated pathology. We therefore recommend a single set of CFE parameters that should give near optimal results in future studies where the group effect is unknown. We then demonstrate the proposed method by comparing apparent fibre density between motor neurone disease (MND) patients with control subjects. The MND results illustrate the benefit of fixel-specific statistical inference in white matter regions that contain crossing fibres. (C) 2015 The Authors.

40,40,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an increasingly important tool in mapping the functional networks of the brain. This tool has been used to examine network changes induced by cognitive and emotional states, neurological traits, and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, noise that remains in the rs-fMRI data after preprocessing has limited the reliability of individual-subject results, wherein scanner artifacts, subject movements, and other noise sources induce non-neural temporal correlations in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) timeseries. Numerous preprocessing methods have been proposed to isolate and remove these confounds; however, the field has not coalesced around a standard preprocessing pipeline. In comparisons, these preprocessing methods are often assessed with only a single metric of rs-fMRI data quality, such as reliability, without considering other aspects in tandem, such as signal-to-noise ratio and group discriminability. The present study seeks to identify the data preprocessing pipeline that optimizes rs-fMRI data across multiple outcome measures. Specifically, we aim to minimize the noise in the data and maximize result reliability, while retaining the unique features that characterize distinct groups. We examine how these metrics are influenced by bandpass filter selection and noise regression in four datasets, totaling 181 rs-fMRI scans and 38 subject-driven memory scans. Additionally, we perform two different rs-fMRI analysis methods - dual regression and region-of-interest based functional connectivity - and highlight the preprocessing parameters that optimize both approaches. Our results expand upon previous reports of individual-scan reliability, and demonstrate that preprocessing parameter selection can significantly change the noisiness, reliability, and heterogeneity of rs-fMRI data.

42,42,"The aim of this study was to assess whether mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with disruption in large-scale structural networks in newly diagnosed, drug-naive patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Graph theoretical analyses were applied to 3T MRI data from 123 PD patients and 56 controls from the Parkinson's progression markers initiative (PPMI). Thirty-three patients were classified as having Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) using the Movement Disorders Society Task Force criteria, while the remaining 90 PD patients were classified as cognitively normal (PD-CN). Global measures (clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency, small-worldness) and regional measures (regional clustering coefficient, regional efficiency, hubs) were assessed in the structural networks that were constructed based on cortical thickness and subcortical volume data. PD-MCI patients showed a marked reduction in the average correlation strength between cortical and subcortical regions compared with controls. These patients had a larger characteristic path length and reduced global efficiency in addition to a lower regional efficiency in frontal and parietal regions compared with PD-CN patients and controls. A reorganization of the highly connected regions in the network was observed in both groups of patients. This study shows that the earliest stages of cognitive decline in PD are associated with a disruption in the large-scale coordination of the brain network and with a decrease of the efficiency of parallel information processing. These changes are likely to signal further cognitive decline and provide support to the role of aberrant network topology in cognitive impairment in patients with early PD.

43,43,"Newer approaches to characterizing hippocampal morphology can provide novel insights regarding cognitive function across the lifespan. We comprehensively assessed the relationships among age, hippocampal morphology, and hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in 137 healthy individuals across the adult lifespan (18-86 years of age). They underwent MRI, cognitive assessments and genotyping for Apolipoprotein E status. We measured hippocampal subfield volumes using a new multiatlas segmentation tool (MAGeT-Brain) and assessed vertex-wise (inward and outward displacements) and global surface-based descriptions of hippocampus morphology. We examined the effects of age on hippocampal morphology, as well as the relationship among age, hippocampal morphology, and episodic and working memory performance. Age and volume were modestly correlated across hippocampal subfields. Significant patterns of inward and outward displacement in hippocampal head and tail were associated with age. The first principal shape component of the left hippocampus, characterized by a lengthening of the antero-posterior axis was prominently associated with working memory performance across the adult lifespan. In contrast, no significant relationships were found among subfield volumes and cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate that hippocampal shape plays a unique and important role in hippocampal-dependent cognitive aging across the adult lifespan, meriting consideration as a biomarker in strategies targeting the delay of cognitive aging.

44,44,"With the mapping of macroscale connectomes by means of in vivo diffusion-weighted MR Imaging (DWI) rapidly gaining in popularity, one of the necessary steps is the examination of metrics of connectivity strength derived from these reconstructions. In the field of human macroconnectomics the number of reconstructed fiber streamlines (NOS) is more and more used as a metric of cortico-cortical interareal connectivity strength, but the link between DWI NOS and in vivo animal tract-tracing measurements of anatomical connectivity strength remains poorly understood. In this technical report, we communicate on a comparison between DWI derived metrics and tract-tracing metrics of projection strength. Tract-tracing information on projection strength of interareal pathways was extracted from two commonly used macaque connectome datasets, including (1) the CoCoMac database of collated tract-tracing experiments of the macaque brain and (2) the high-resolution tract-tracing dataset of Markov and Kennedy and coworkers. NOS and density of reconstructed fiber pathways derived from DWI data acquired across 10 rhesus macaques was found to positively correlate to tract-tracing based measurements of connectivity strength across both the CoCoMac and Markov dataset (both P<0.001), suggesting DWI NOS to form a valid method of assessment of the projection strength of white matter pathways. Our findings provide confidence of in vivo DWI connectome reconstructions to represent fairly realistic estimates of the wiring strength of white matter projections. Our cross-modal comparison supports the notion of in vivo DWI to be a valid methodology for robust description and interpretation of brain wiring. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3064-3075, 2015.

45,45,"Diffusion imaging can assess the white matter connections within the brain, revealing how neural pathways break down in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We analyzed 3-Tesla whole-brain diffusion-weighted images from 202 participants scanned by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-50 healthy controls, 110 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 42 AD patients. From whole-brain tractography, we reconstructed structural brain connectivity networks to map connections between cortical regions. We tested whether AD disrupts the rich club - a network property where high-degree network nodes are more interconnected than expected by chance. We calculated the rich club properties at a range of degree thresholds, as well as other network topology measures including global degree, clustering coefficient, path length, and efficiency. Network disruptions predominated in the low-degree regions of the connectome in patients, relative to controls. The other metrics also showed alterations, suggesting a distinctive pattern of disruption in AD, less pronounced in MCI, targeting global brain connectivity, and focusing on more remotely connected nodes rather than the central core of the network. AD involves severely reduced structural connectivity; our step-wise rich club coefficients analyze points to disruptions predominantly in the peripheral network components; other modalities of data are needed to know if this indicates impaired communication among non rich club regions. The highly connected core was relatively preserved, offering new evidence on the neural basis of progressive risk for cognitive decline. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3087-3103, 2015.

46,46,"ObjectivesAlthough diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and postmortem dissections improved the knowledge of white matter (WM) anatomy, functional information is lacking. Our aims are: to provide a subcortical atlas of human brain functions; to elucidate the functional roles of different bundles; to provide a probabilistic resection map of WM. Experimental designWe studied 130 patients who underwent awake surgery for gliomas (82 left; 48 right) with electrostimulation mapping at cortical and subcortical levels. Different aspects of language, sensori-motor, spatial cognition, and visual functions were monitored. 339 regions of interest (ROIs) including the functional response errors collected during stimulation were co-registered in the MNI space, as well as the resections' areas and residual tumors. Functional response errors and resection areas were matched with DTI and cortical atlases. Subcortical maps for each function and a probability map of resection were computed. Principal observationsThe medial part of dorsal stream (arcuate fasciculus) subserves phonological processing; its lateral part [indirect anterior portion of the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF)] subserves speech planning. The ventral stream subserves language semantics and matches with the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle. Reading deficits match with the inferior longitudinal fascicle. Anomias match with the indirect posterior portion of the SLF. Frontal WM underpins motor planning and execution. Right parietal WM subserves spatial cognition. Sensori-motor and visual fibers were the most preserved bundles. ConclusionsWe report the first anatomo-functional atlas of WM connectivity in humans by correlating cognitive data, electrostimulation, and DTI. We provide a valuable tool for cognitive neurosciences and clinical applications. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3117-3136, 2015.

47,47,"Two new directions of functional connectivity investigation are emerging to advance studies of the brain's functional organization. First, the identification of task-related dynamics of functional connectivity has elicited a growing interest in characterizing the brain's functional reorganization due to task demands. Second, the nonstationarity of functional connectivity [i.e., functional connectivity variability (FCV)] within a single brain state has been increasingly recognized and studied. However, a combined investigation of these two avenues of research to explore the potential task-modulation of FCV is lacking, which, nevertheless, could both improve our understanding of the potential sources of FCV and also reveal new strategies to study the neural correlates of task performance. In this study, 19 human subjects underwent four functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans including both resting and task states to study task-related modulation of FCV. Consistent with the hypothesis that FCV is partly underpinned by unconstrained mind wandering, FCV demonstrated significant task-related decreases measured at the regional, network and system levels, which was greater for between-network interactions than within-network connections. Conversely, there remained a significant degree of residual variability during the task scans, suggesting that FCV is not specific to the resting state and likely includes an intrinsic, physiologically driven component. Finally, the degree of task-induced decreases in FCV was significantly correlated with task performance accuracy, supporting its behavior significance. Overall, task modulation of FCV may represent an important direction for future studies, not only to provide insight into normal brain functioning but also to reveal potential biomarkers of various brain disorders.

48,48,"Ego-disturbances have been a topic in schizophrenia research since the earliest clinical descriptions of the disorder. Manifesting as a feeling that one's self, ego, or I is disintegrating or that the border between one's self and the external world is dissolving, ego-disintegration or dissolution is also an important feature of the psychedelic experience, such as is produced by psilocybin (a compound found in magic mushrooms). Fifteen healthy subjects took part in this placebo-controlled study. Twelve-minute functional MRI scans were acquired on two occasions: subjects received an intravenous infusion of saline on one occasion (placebo) and 2 mg psilocybin on the other. Twenty-two visual analogue scale ratings were completed soon after scanning and the first principal component of these, dominated by items referring to ego-dissolution, was used as a primary measure of interest in subsequent analyses. Employing methods of connectivity analysis and graph theory, an association was found between psilocybin-induced ego-dissolution and decreased functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and high-level cortical regions. Ego-dissolution was also associated with a disintegration of the salience network and reduced interhemispheric communication. Addressing baseline brain dynamics as a predictor of drug-response, individuals with lower diversity of executive network nodes were more likely to experience ego-dissolution under psilocybin. These results implicate MTL-cortical decoupling, decreased salience network integrity, and reduced inter-hemispheric communication in psilocybin-induced ego disturbance and suggest that the maintenance of selfor ego, as a perceptual phenomenon, may rest on the normal functioning of these systems.

49,49,"Emotion dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with loss of cognitive control in the face of intense negative emotion. Negative emotional context may interfere with cognitive processing through the dysmodulation of brain regions involved in regulation of emotion, impulse control, executive function and memory. Structural and metabolic brain abnormalities have been reported in these regions in BPD. Using novel fMRI protocols, we investigated the neural basis of negative affective interference with cognitive processing targeting these regions. Attention-driven Go No-Go and X-CPT (continuous performance test) protocols, using positive, negative and neutral Ekman faces, targeted the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), respectively. A stimulus-driven Episodic Memory task, using images from the International Affective Pictures System, targeted the hippocampus (HIP). Participants comprised 23 women with BPD, who were compared with 15 healthy controls. When Negative > Positive faces were compared in the Go No-Go task, BPD subjects had hyper-activation relative to controls in areas reflecting task-relevant processing: the superior parietal/precuneus and the basal ganglia. Decreased activation was also noted in the OFC, and increased activation in the amygdala (AMY). In the X-CPT, BPD subjects again showed hyper-activation in task-relevant areas: the superior parietal/precuneus and the ACC. In the stimulus-driven Episodic Memory task, BPD subjects had decreased activation relative to controls in the HIP, ACC, superior parietal/precuneus, and dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) (for encoding), and the ACC, dPFC, and HIP for retrieval of Negative > Positive pictures, reflecting impairment of task-relevant functions. Negative affective interference with cognitive processing in BPD differs from that in healthy controls and is associated with functional abnormalities in brain networks reported to have structural or metabolic abnormalities. Task demands exert a differential effect on the cognitive response to negative emotion in BPD compared with control subjects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

50,50,"The maturation of cortical structures, and the establishment of their connectivity, are critical neurodevelopmental processes that support and enable cognitive and behavioral functioning. Measures of cortical development, including thickness, curvature, and gyrification have been extensively studied in older children, adolescents, and adults, revealing regional associations with cognitive performance, and alterations with disease or pathology. In addition to these gross morphometric measures, increased attention has recently focused on quantifying more specific indices of cortical structure, in particular intracortical myelination, and their relationship to cognitive skills, including IQ, executive functioning, and language performance. Here we analyze the progression of cortical myelination across early childhood, from 1 to 6 years of age, in vivo for the first time. Using two quantitative imaging techniques, namely T-1 relaxation time and myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, we characterize myelination throughout the cortex, examine developmental trends, and investigate hemispheric and gender-based differences. We present a pattern of cortical myelination that broadly mirrors established histological timelines, with somatosensory, motor and visual cortices myelinating by 1 year of age; and frontal and temporal cortices exhibiting more protracted myelination. Developmental trajectories, defined by logarithmic functions (increasing for MWF, decreasing for T-1), were characterized for each of 68 cortical regions. Comparisons of trajectories between hemispheres and gender revealed no significant differences. Results illustrate the ability to quantitatively map cortical myelination throughout early neurodevelopment, and may provide an important new tool for investigating typical and atypical development.

51,51,"Recent advances in functional connectivity methods havemade it possible to identify brain hubs-a set of highly connected regions serving as integrators of distributed neuronal activity. The integrative role of hub nodes makes these areas points of high vulnerability to dysfunction in brain disorders, and abnormal hub connectivity profiles have been described for several neuropsychiatric disorders. The identification of analogous functional connectivity hubs in preclinical species like the mouse may provide critical insight into the elusive biological underpinnings of these connectional alterations. To spatially locate functional connectivity hubs in the mouse brain, here we applied a fully-weighted network analysis to map whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity (i.e., the functional connectome) at a high-resolution voxel-scale. Analysis of a large resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) dataset revealed the presence of six distinct functional modules related to known large-scale functional partitions of the brain, including a default-mode network (DMN). Consistent with human studies, highly-connected functional hubs were identified in several sub-regions of the DMN, including the anterior and posterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices, in the thalamus, and in small foci within well-known integrative cortical structures such as the insular and temporal association cortices. According to their integrative role, the identified hubs exhibited mutual preferential interconnections. These findings highlight the presence of evolutionarily-conserved, mutually-interconnected functional hubs in the mouse brain, and may guide future investigations of the biological foundations of aberrant rsfMRI hub connectivity associated with brain pathological states.

52,52,"This study evaluated the utility of baseline and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of medial temporal lobe brain regions collected when participants were cognitively normal and largely in middle age (mean age 57 years) to predict the time to onset of clinical symptoms associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, we examined whether the relationship between MRI measures and clinical symptom onset was modified by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and level of cognitive reserve (CR). MRI scans and measures of CR were obtained at baseline from 245 participants who had been followed for up to 18 years (mean follow-up 11 years). A composite score based on reading, vocabulary, and years of education was used as an index of CR. Cox regression models showed that lower baseline volume of the right hippocampus and smaller baseline thickness of the right entorhinal cortex predicted the time to symptom onset independently of CR and ApoE-4 genotype, which also predicted the onset of symptoms. The atrophy rates of bilateral entorhinal cortex and amygdala volumes were also associated with time to symptom onset, independent of CR, ApoE genotype, and baseline volume. Only one measure, the left entorhinal cortex baseline volume, interacted with CR, such that smaller volumes predicted symptom onset only in individuals with lower CR. These results suggest that MRI measures of medial temporal atrophy, ApoE-4 genotype, and the protective effects of higher CR all predict the time to onset of symptoms associated with MCI in a largely independent, additive manner during the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease.

54,54,"One of the most striking demonstrations of plasticity in the adult human brain follows peripheral injury, such as amputation. In the primary sensorimotor cortex, arm amputation results in massive local remapping of the missing hands' cortical territory. However, little is known about the consequences of sensorimotor deprivation on global brain organisation. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to identify large-scale reorganisation beyond the primary sensorimotor cortex in arm amputees, compared with two-handed controls. Specifically, we characterised changes in functional connectivity between the cortical territory of the missing hand in the primary sensorimotor cortex ('missing hand cortex') and two networks of interest: the sensorimotor network, which is typically strongly associated with the hand cortex, and the default mode network (DMN), which is normally dissociated from it. Functional connectivity values between the missing hand cortex and the sensorimotor network were reduced in amputees, and connectivity was weaker in individuals amputated for longer periods. Lower levels of functional coupling between the missing hand cortex and the sensorimotor network were also associated with emerged coupling of this cortex with the DMN. Our results demonstrate that plasticity following arm amputation is not restricted to local remapping occurring within the sensorimotor homunculus of the missing hand but rather produces a cascade of cortical reorganisation at a network-level scale. These findings may provide a new framework for understanding how local deprivation following amputation could elicit complex perceptual experiences of phantom sensations, such as phantom pain.

Our results demonstrate that plasticity following arm amputation is not restricted to local remapping occurring within the sensorimotor homunculus of the missing hand but rather produces a cascade of cortical reorganisation at a network-level scale. These findings may provide a new framework for understanding how local deprivation following amputation could elicit complex perceptual experiences of phantom sensations, such as phantom pain.

55,55,"How does cognition emerge from neural dynamics? The dominant hypothesis states that interactions among distributed brain regions through phase synchronization give basis for cognitive processing. Such phase-synchronized networks are transient and dynamic, established on the timescale of milliseconds in order to perform specific cognitive operations. But unlike resting-state networks, the complex organization of transient cognitive networks is typically not characterized within the graph theory framework. Thus, it is not known whether cognitive processing merely changes the strength of functional connections or, conversely, requires qualitatively new topological arrangements of functional networks. To address this question, we recorded high-density EEG while subjects performed a visual discrimination task. We conducted an event-related network analysis (ERNA) where source-space weighted functional networks were characterized with graph measures. ERNA revealed rapid, transient, and frequency-specific reorganization of the network's topology during cognition. Specifically, cognitive networks were characterized by strong clustering, low modularity, and strong interactions between hub-nodes. Our findings suggest that dense and clustered connectivity between the hub nodes belonging to different modules is the ""network fingerprint"" of cognition. Such reorganization patterns-might facilitate global integration of information and provide a substrate for a ""global workspace"" necessary for cognition and consciousness to occur.

58,58,"Broca's area is proposed as a crucial brain area for linguistic computations. Language processing goes beyond word-level processing, also implying the integration of meaningful information (semantics) with the underlying structural skeleton (syntax). There is an on-going debate about the specialisation of the subregions of Broca's area-Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45-regarding the latter aspects. Here, we tested if syntactic information is specifically processed in BA 44, whereas BA 45 is mainly recruited for semantic processing. We contrasted conditions with sentence structure against conditions with random order in two fMRI experiments. Besides, in order to disentangle these processes, we systematically removed the amount of semantic information available in the stimuli. This was achieved in Experiment 1 by replacing meaningful words (content words) by pseudowords. Within real word conditions we found broad activation in the left hemisphere, including the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/45/47), the anterior temporal lobe and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and sulcus (pSTS). For pseudowords we found a similar activation pattern, still involving BA 45. Among the pseudowords in Experiment 1, we kept those word elements that convey meaning like un-in unhappy or -hood in brotherhood (i.e. derivational morphology). In Experiment 2 we tested whether the activation in BA 45 was due to their presence. We therefore further removed derivational morphology, only leaving word elements that determine syntactic structure (i.e. inflectional morphology, e.g. the verb ending -s in he paints). Now, in the absence of all semantic cues, including derivational morphology, only BA 44 was active. Additional analyses showed a selective responsiveness of this area to syntax-relevant cues. These findings confirm BA 44 as a core area for the processing of pure syntactic information. This furthermore suggests that the brain represents structural and meaningful aspects of language separately. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

59,59,"Normal aging is known to result in a reduction of gray matter within the hippocampal complex, particularly in the subiculum. The present study was designed to address the question whether the practice of meditation can amend this age-related subicular atrophy. For this purpose, we established the Correlations between subicular volume and chronological age within 50 long-term meditators and 50 control subjects. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were automatically processed combining cytoarchitectonically defined probabilistic maps with advanced tissue segmentation and registration methods. Overall, we observed steeper negative regression slopes in controls. The analysis further revealed a significant group-by-age interaction for the left subiculum with a significant negative correlation between age and subicular volume in controls, but no significant correlation in meditators. Altogether, these findings seem to suggest a reduced age-related atrophy of the left subiculum in meditators compared to healthy controls. Possible explanations might be a relative increase of subicular tissue over time through long-term training as meditation is a process that incorporates regular and ongoing mental efforts. Alternatively, because meditation is an established form of reducing stress, our observation might reflect an overall preservation of subicular tissue through a reduced neuronal vulnerability to negative effects of stress.

60,60,"Previous studies have shown that brain activity between partners is synchronized during cooperative exchange. Whether this neural synchronization depends on the gender of partner (i.e., opposite or same to the participant) is open to be explored. In current study, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based hyperscanning to study cooperation in a two-person game (female-female, female-male, and male-male) while assaying brain-to-brain interactions. Cooperation was greater in male-male pairs than in female-female pairs, with intermediate cooperation levels for female-male pairs. More importantly, in dyads with partners with opposite gender (female-male pairs), we found significant task-related cross-brain coherence in frontal regions (i.e., frontopolar cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) whereas the cooperation in same gender dyads (female-female pairs and male-male pairs) was not associated with such synchronization. Moreover, the changes of such interbrain coherence across task blocks were significantly correlated with change in degree of cooperation only in mixed-sex dyads. These findings suggested that different neural processes underlie cooperation between mixed-sex and same-sex dyadic interactions. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2039-2048, 2015.

61,61,"In male Caucasian subjects, learning is facilitated by receipt of social compared with non-social feedback, and the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) facilitates this effect. In this study, we have first shown a cultural difference in that male Chinese subjects actually perform significantly worse in the same reinforcement associated learning task with social (emotional faces) compared with non-social feedback. Nevertheless, in two independent double-blind placebo (PLC) controlled between-subject design experiments we found OXT still selectively facilitated learning with social feedback. Similar to Caucasian subjects this OXT effect was strongest with feedback using female rather than male faces. One experiment performed in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that during the response, but not feedback phase of the task, OXT selectively increased activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and putamen during the social feedback condition, and functional connectivity between the amygdala and insula and caudate. Therefore, OXT may be increasing the salience and reward value of anticipated social feedback. In the PLC group, response times and state anxiety scores during social feedback were associated with signal changes in these same regions but not in the OXT group. OXT may therefore have also facilitated learning by reducing anxiety in the social feedback condition. Overall our results provide the first evidence for cultural differences in social facilitation of learning per se, but a similar selective enhancement of learning with social feedback under OXT. This effect of OXT may be associated with enhanced responses and functional connectivity in emotional memory and reward processing regions. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2132-2146, 2015.

62,62,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions primarily characterized by abnormalities in social cognition. Abundant previous functional MRI studies have shown atypical activity in networks encompassing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medial parietal regions corresponding to posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PCU). Conversely, studies assessing structural brain anomalies in ASD have been rather inconsistent. The current work evaluated whether structural changes in ASD can be reliability detected in a large multicenter dataset. Our comprehensive structural MRI framework encompassed cortical thickness mapping and structural covariance analysis based on three independent samples comprising individuals with ASD and controls (n=220), selected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange open-access database. Surface-based analysis revealed increased cortical thickness in ASD relative to controls in mPFC and lateral prefrontal cortex. Clusters encompassing mPFC were embedded in altered inter-regional covariance networks, showing decreased covariance in ASD relative to controls primarily to PCC/PCU and inferior parietal regions. Cortical thickness increases and covariance reductions in ASD were consistent, yet of variable effect size, across the different sites evaluated and measurable both in children and adults. Our multisite study shows regional and network-level structural alterations in mPFC in ASD that, possibly, relate to atypical socio-cognitive functions in this condition.

63,63,"Few studies have examined multiple measures of white matter (WM) differences in youth with familial risk for bipolar disorder (FR-BD). To investigate WM in the FR-BD group, we used three measures of WM structure and two methods of analysis. We used fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) to analyze diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings in 25 youth with familial risk for bipolar disorder, defined as having both a parent with BD and mood dysregulation, and 16 sex-, age-, and IQ-matched healthy controls. We conducted a whole brain voxelwise analysis using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS). Subsequently, we conducted a complementary atlas-based, region-of-interest analysis using Diffeomap to confirm results seen in TBSS. When TBSS was used, significant widespread between-group differences were found showing increased FA, increased AD, and decreased RD in the FR-BD group in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, cingulate, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFOF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and corpus callosum. Atlas-based analysis confirmed significant between-group differences, with increased FA and decreased RD in the FR-BD group in the SET, cingulum, and SFOF. We found significant widespread WM tract aberrations in youth with familial risk for BD using two complementary methods of DTI analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

64,64,"During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (stage N3), when consciousness fades, cortico-cortical interactions are impaired while neurons are still active and reactive. Why is this? We compared cortico-cortical evoked-potentials recorded during wakefulness and NREM by means of time-frequency analysis and phase-locking measures in 8 epileptic patients undergoing intra-cerebral stimulations/recordings for clinical evaluation. We observed that, while during wakefulness electrical stimulation triggers a chain of deterministic phase-locked activations in its cortical targets, during NREM the same input induces a slow wave associated with an OFF-period (suppression of power > 20 Hz), possibly reflecting a neuronal down-state. Crucially, after the OFF-period, cortical activity resumes to wakefulness-like levels, but the deterministic effects of the initial input are lost, as indicated by a sharp drop of phase-locked activity. These findings suggest that the intrinsic tendency of cortical neurons to fall into a down-state after a transient activation (i.e. bistability) prevents the emergence of stable patterns of causal interactions among cortical areas during NREM. Besides sleep, the same basic neurophysiological dynamics may play a role in pathological conditions in which thalamo-cortical information integration and consciousness are impaired in spite of preserved neuronal activity.

65,65,"Individuals experience reward not only when directly receiving positive outcomes (e.g., food or money), but also when observing others receive such outcomes. This latter phenomenon, known as vicarious reward, is a perennial topic of interest among psychologists and economists. More recently, neuroscientists have begun exploring the neuroanatomy underlying vicarious reward. Here we present a quantitative whole-brain meta-analysis of this emerging literature. We identified 25 functional neuroimaging studies that included contrasts between vicarious reward and a neutral control, and subjected these contrasts to an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) metaanalysis. This analysis revealed a consistent pattern of activation across studies, spanning structures typically associated with the computation of value (especially ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and mentalizing (including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus). We further quantitatively compared this activation pattern to activation foci from a previous meta-analysis of personal reward. Conjunction analyses yielded overlapping VMPFC activity in response to personal and vicarious reward. Contrast analyses identified preferential engagement of the nucleus accumbens in response to personal as compared to vicarious reward, and in mentalizing-related structures in response to vicarious as compared to personal reward. These data shed light on the common and unique components of the reward that individuals experience directly and through their social connections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

66,66,"Aim: MR-based correction for photon attenuation in PET/MRI remains challenging, particularly for neurological applications requiring quantitation of data. Existing methods are either not sufficiently accurate or are limited by the computation time required. The goal of this study was to develop an MR-based attenuation correction method that accurately separates bone tissue from air and provides continuous-valued attenuation coefficients for bone. Materials andmethods: PET/MRI and CT datasets were obtained from 98 subjects (mean age [+/- SD]: 66 yrs [+/- 9.8], 57 females) using an IRB-approved protocol and with informed consent. Subjects were injected with 352 +/- 29 MBq of F-18-Florbetapir tracer, and PET acquisitions were begun either immediately or 50 min after injection. CT images of the head were acquired separately using a PET/CT system. Dual echo ultrashort echo-time (UTE) images and two-point Dixon images were acquired. Regions of air were segmented via a threshold of the voxel-wise multiplicative inverse of the UTE echo 1 image. Regions of bone were segmented via a threshold of the R2* image computed from the UTE echo 1 and UTE echo 2 images. Regions of fat and soft tissue were segmented using fat and water images decomposed from the Dixon images. Air, fat, and soft tissue were assigned linear attenuation coefficients (LACs) of 0, 0.092, and 0.1 cm(-1), respectively. LACs for bone were derived froma regression analysis between corresponding R2* and CT values. PET images were reconstructed using the gold standard CT method and the proposed CAR-RiDR method. Results: The RiDR segmentation method produces mean Dice coefficient +/- SD across subjects of 0.75 +/- 0.05 for bone and 0.60 +/- 0.08 for air. The CAR model for bone LACs greatly improves accuracy in estimating CT values (28.2% +/- 3.0 mean error) compared to the use of a constant CT value (46.9% +/- 5.8, p < 10(-6)). Finally, the CAR-RiDR method provides a low whole-brain mean absolute percent-error (MAPE +/- SD) in PET reconstructions across subjects of 2.55% +/- 0.86. Regional PET errors were also low and ranged from 0.88% to 3.79% in 24 brain ROIs. Conclusion: We propose anMR-based attenuation correction method (CAR-RiDR) for quantitative PET neurological imaging. The proposed method employs UTE and Dixon images and consists of two novel components: 1) accurate segmentation of air and bone using the inverse of the UTE1 image and the R2* image, respectively and 2) estimation of continuous LAC values for bone using a regression between R2* and CT-Hounsfield units.

67,67,"The anticipation of pain has been investigated in a variety of brain imaging studies. Importantly, today there is no clear overall picture of the areas that are involved in different studies and the exact role of these regions in pain expectation remains especially unexploited. To address this issue, we used activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis to analyze pain anticipation in several neuroimaging studies. A total of 19 functional magnetic resonance imaging were included in the analysis to search for the cortical areas involved in pain anticipation in human experimental models. During anticipation, activated foci were found in the dorsolateral prefrontal, midcingulate and anterior insula cortices, medial and inferior frontal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, middle and superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, and caudate. Deactivated foci were found in the anterior cingulate, superior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and in the claustrum. The results of the meta-analytic connectivity analysis provide an overall view of the brain responses triggered by the anticipation of a noxious stimulus. Such a highly distributed perceptual set of self-regulation may prime brain regions to process information where emotion, action and perception as well as their related subcategories play a central role. Not only do these findings provide important information on the neural events when anticipating pain, but also they may give a perspective into nocebo responses, whereby negative expectations may lead to pain worsening.

68,68,"Multi-atlas based methods have been recently used for classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, that is, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Compared with traditional single-atlas based methods, multiatlas based methods adopt multiple predefined atlases and thus are less biased by a certain atlas. However, most existing multiatlas based methods simply average or concatenate the features from multiple atlases, which may ignore the potentially important diagnosis information related to the anatomical differences among different atlases. In this paper, we propose a novel view (i.e., atlas) centralized multi-atlas classification method, which can better exploit useful information in multiple feature representations from different atlases. Specifically, all brain images are registered onto multiple atlases individually, to extract feature representations in each atlas space. Then, the proposed view-centralized multi-atlas feature selection method is used to select the most discriminative features from each atlas with extra guidance from other atlases. Next, we design a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using the selected features in each atlas space. Finally, we combine multiple SVM classifiers for multiple atlases through a classifier ensemble strategy for making a final decision.

We first demonstrate non-invasively that cortical occurrences of high-frequency oscillatory activity are conditioned to the phase of slower spontaneous fluctuations in neural ensembles.

71,71,"Accelerated cell aging, indexed in peripheral leukocytes by telomere shortness and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by telomerase activity, has been reported in several studies of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the relevance of these peripheral measures for brain indices that are presumably more directly related to MDD pathophysiology is unknown. In this study, we explored the relationship between PBMC telomerase activity and leukocyte telomere length and magnetic resonance imaging-estimated hippocampal volume in un-medicated depressed individuals and healthy controls. We predicted that to the extent peripheral and central telomerase activity are directly related, PBMC telomerase activity would be positively correlated with hippocampal volume, perhaps due to hippocampal telomerase-associated neurogenesis, neuroprotection or neurotrophic facilitation, and that this effect would be clearer in individuals with increased PBMC telomerase activity, as previously reported in un-medicated MDD. We did not have specific hypotheses regarding the relationship between leukocyte telomere length and hippocampal volume, due to conflicting reports in the published literature. We found, in 25 un-medicated MDD subjects, that PBMC telomerase activity was significantly positively correlated with hippocampal volume; this relationship was not observed in 18 healthy controls. Leukocyte telomere length was not significantly related to hippocampal volume in either group (19 unmedicated MDD subjects and 17 healthy controls). Although the nature of the relationship between peripheral telomerase activity and telomere length and the hippocampus is unclear, these preliminary data are consistent with the possibility that PBMC telomerase activity indexes, and may provide a novel window into, hippocampal neuroprotection and/or neurogenesis in MDD.

72,72,"Background: Impairment in episodic memory is one of the most robust findings in schizophrenia. Disruptions of fronto-temporal functional connectivity that could explain some aspects of these deficits have been reported. Recent work has identified abnormal hippocampal function in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia (SZ), such as increased metabolism and glutamate content that are not always seen in medicated SZ. For these reasons, we hypothesized that altered fronto-temporal connectivity might originate from the hippocampus and might be partially restored by antipsychotic medication. Methods: Granger causality methods were used to evaluate the effective connectivity between frontal and temporal regions in 21 unmedicated SZ and 20 matched healthy controls (HC) during performance of an episodic memory retrieval task. In 16 SZ, effective connectivity between these regions was evaluated before and after 1-week of antipsychotic treatment. Results: In HC, significant effective connectivity originating from the right hippocampus to frontal regions was identified. Compared to HC, unmedicated SZ showed significant altered fronto-temporal effective connectivity, including reduced right hippocampal to right medial frontal connectivity. After 1-week of antipsychotic treatment, connectivity more closely resembled the patterns observed in HC, including increased effective connectivity from the right hippocampus to frontal regions. Conclusions: These results support the notion that memory disruption in schizophrenia might originate from hippocampal dysfunction and that medication restores some aspects of fronto-temporal dysconnectivity. Patterns of fronto-temporal connectivity could provide valuable biomarkers to identify new treatments for the symptoms of schizophrenia, including memory deficits. Hum Brain Mapp 36:1442-1457, 2015.

Poor gait performance in dual-task conditions, such as walking while performing a secondary cognitive interference task, is associated with increased risk of frailty, disability, and death. Yet, the functional neural substrates that support locomotion are not well established. We examined the functional connectivity associated with gait velocity in single- (normal pace walking) and dual-task (walking while talking) conditions using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We acquired 6 minutes of resting-state fMRI data in 30 cognitively healthy older adults. Independent components analyses were performed to separate resting-state fMRI data into group-level statistically independent spatial components that correlated with gait velocity in single- and dual-task conditions. Gait velocity in both task conditions was associated with similar functional connectivity in sensorimotor, visual, vestibular, and left fronto-parietal cortical areas. Compared to gait velocity in the single-task condition, the networks associated with gait velocity in the dual-task condition were associated with greater functional connectivity in supplementary motor and prefrontal regions. Our findings show that there are partially overlapping functional networks associated with single- and dual-task walking conditions.

74,74,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance image (rs-fMRI) is increasingly used to study functional brain networks. Nevertheless, variability in these networks due to factors such as sex and aging is not fully understood. This study explored sex differences in normal age trajectories of resting-state networks (RSNs) using a novel voxel-wise measure of functional connectivity, the intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). Males and females showed differential patterns of changing connectivity in large-scale RSNs during normal aging from early adulthood to late middle-age. In some networks, such as the default-mode network, males and females both showed decreases in connectivity with age, albeit at different rates. In other networks, such as the fronto-parietal network, males and females showed divergent connectivity trajectories with age. Main effects of sex and age were found in many of the same regions showing sex-related differences in aging. Finally, these sex differences in aging trajectories were robust to choice of preprocessing strategy, such as global signal regression. Our findings resolve some discrepancies in the literature, especially with respect to the trajectory of connectivity in the default mode, which can be explained by our observed interactions between sex and aging. Overall, results indicate that RSNs show different aging trajectories for males and females.

75,75,"Speaking is one of the most complex motor behaviors developed to facilitate human communication. The underlying neural mechanisms of speech involve sensory-motor interactions that incorporate feedback information for online monitoring and control of produced speech sounds. In the present study, we adopted an auditory feedback pitch perturbation paradigm and combined it with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in order to identify brain areas involved in speech production and motor control. Subjects underwent fMRI scanning while they produced a steady vowel sound/a/(speaking) or listened to the playback of their own vowel production (playback). During each condition, the auditory feedback from vowel production was either normal (no perturbation) or perturbed by an upward (+600 cents) pitch-shift stimulus randomly. Analysis of BOLD responses during speaking (with and without shift) vs. rest revealed activation of a complex network including bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), Heschl's gyrus, precentral gyrus, supplementary motor area (SMA), Rolandic operculum, postcentral gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Performance correlation analysis showed that the subjects produced compensatory vocal responses that significantly correlated with BOLD response increases in bilateral STG and left precentral gyrus. However, during playback, the activation network was limited to cortical auditory areas including bilateral STG and Heschl's gyrus. Moreover, the contrast between speaking vs. playback highlighted a distinct functional network that included bilateral precentral gyrus, SMA, IFG, postcentral gyrus and insula. These findings suggest that speech motor control involves feedback error detection in sensory (e. g. auditory) cortices that subsequently activate motor-related areas for the adjustment of speech parameters during speaking.

76,76,"The corpus callosum has been implicated as a region of dysfunctional connectivity in schizophrenia, but the association between age and callosal pathology is unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRO and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) were performed on adults (n=34) and adolescents (n=17) with schizophrenia and adult (n=33) and adolescent (n=15) age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The corpus callosum was manually traced on each participant's MRL and the DTI scan was co-registered to the MRL The corpus callosum was divided into five anteroposterior segments. Area and anisotropy were calculated for each segment. Both patient groups demonstrated reduced callosal anisotropy; however, the adolescents exhibited reductions mostly in anterior regions while the reductions were more prominent in posterior regions of the adults. The adolescent patients showed greater decreases in absolute area as compared with the adult patients, particularly in the anterior segments. However, the adults showed greater reductions when area was considered relative to whole brain white matter volume. Our results suggest that the initial stages of the illness are characteiized by deficiencies in frontal connections, and the chronic phase is characterized by deficits in the posterior corpus callosum; or, alternatively, adolescent-onset schizophrenia may represent a different or more severe form of the illness.

77,77,"Dividing schizophrenia into its deficit (SZD) and nondeficit (SZND) subtypes may help to identify specific and more homogeneous pathophysiological characteristics. Our aim was to define a whole brain voxelwise map specifically characterizing white matter tracts of schizophrenia patients with and without the deficit syndrome. We compared microstructural diffusion-related parameters as measured by diffusion tensor imaging in 21 SZD patients, 21 SZND patients, and 21 healthy controls, age- and gender-matched. Results showed that fractional anisotropy was reduced in the right precentral area in SZND patients, and in the left corona radiata of the schizophrenia group as a whole. Axial diffusivity was reduced in the left postcentral area of SZD patients and in the left cerebellum of the whole schizophrenia group. Radial diffusivity was increased in the left forceps minor of SZD patients, in the left internal capsule of SZND patients, and in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in the whole schizophrenia group. Mean diffusivity was increased from healthy controls to SZD patients to SZND patients in the right occipital lobe. In conclusion, SZD patients are not simply at the extreme end of a severity continuum of white matter disruption. Rather, the SZD and SZND subtypes are associated with distinct and specific brain microstructural anomalies that are consistent with their peculiar psychopathological dimensions.

78,78,"A small proportion of video game players develop uncontrolled gaming behavior. A dysfunctional cognitive control circuit may explain this excessive behavior. Therefore, the current study investigated whether problem garners are characterized by deficits in various aspects of cognitive control (inhibitory control, error processing, attentional control) by measuring brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging during Go-NoGo and Stroop task performance. In addition, both impulsivity and attentional control were measured using self-reports. Participants comprised 18 problem garners who were compared with 16 matched casual gaming controls. Results indicate significantly increased self-reported impulsivity levels and decreased inhibitory control accompanied by reduced brain activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right inferior parietal lobe (LPL) in problem garners relative to controls. Significant hypoactivation in the left IFG in problem garners was also observed during Stroop task performance, but groups did not differ on behavioral and self-reported measures of attentional control. No evidence was found for reduced error processing in problem garners. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence for reduced inhibitory control in problem garners, while attentional control and error processing were mostly intact. These findings implicate that reduced inhibitory control and elevated impulsivity may constitute a neurocognitive weakness in problem garners. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79,79,"Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure non-invasively the weak electromagnetic fields induced by post-synaptic neural currents. The estimation of the spatial covariance of the signals recorded on M/EEG sensors is a building block of modern data analysis pipelines. Such covariance estimates are used in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) systems, in nearly all source localization methods for spatial whitening as well as for data covariance estimation in beamformers. The rationale for such models is that the signals can be modeled by a zero mean Gaussian distribution. While maximizing the Gaussian likelihood seems natural, it leads to a covariance estimate known as empirical covariance (EC). It turns out that the EC is a poor estimate of the true covariance when the number of samples is small. To address this issue the estimation needs to be regularized. The most common approach downweights off-diagonal coefficients, while more advanced regularization methods are based on shrinkage techniques or generative models with low rank assumptions: probabilistic PCA (PPCA) and factor analysis (FA). Using cross-validation all of these models can be tuned and compared based on Gaussian likelihood computed on unseen data. We investigated these models on simulations, one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset as well as magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets from the most common MEG systems. First, our results demonstrate that different models can be the best, depending on the number of samples, heterogeneity of sensor types and noise properties. Second, we show that the models tuned by cross-validation are superior to models with hand-selected regularization.

80,80,"It is now accepted that hippocampal-and striatal-dependent memory systems do not act independently, but rather interact during both memory acquisition and consolidation. However, the respective functional roles of the hippocampus and the striatum in these processes remain unknown. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in a daytime sleep/wake protocol to investigate this knowledge gap. Using a protocol developed earlier in our lab (Albouy et al., 2013a), the manipulation of an explicit sequential finger-tapping task, allowed us to isolate allocentric (spatial) and egocentric (motor) representations of the sequence, which were supported by distinct hippocampo- and striato-cortical networks, respectively. Importantly, a sleep-dependent performance enhancement emerged for the hippocampal-dependent memory trace, whereas performance was maintained for the striatal-dependent memory trace, irrespective of the sleep condition. Regression analyses indicated that the interaction between these two systems influenced subsequent performance improvements. While striatal activity was negatively correlated with performance enhancement after both sleep and wakefulness in the allocentric representation, hippocampal activity was positively related to performance improvement for the egocentric representation, but only if sleep was allowed after training. Our results provide the first direct evidence of a functional dissociation in consolidation processes whereby memory stabilization seems supported by the striatum in a time-dependent manner whereas memory enhancement seems linked to hippocampal activity and sleep-dependent processes.

81,81,"The origin, structure, and function of the claustrum, as well as its role in neural computation, have remained a mystery since its discovery in the 17th century. Assessing the in vivo connectivity of the claustrum may bring forth useful insights with relevance to model the overall functionality of the claustrum itself. Using structural and diffusion tensor neuroimaging in N=100 healthy subjects, we found that the claustrum has the highest connectivity in the brain by regional volume. Network theoretical analyses revealed that (a) the claustrum is a primary contributor to global brain network architecture, and that (b) significant connectivity dependencies exist between the claustrum, frontal lobe, and cingulate regions. These results illustrate that the claustrum is ideally located within the human central nervous system (CNS) connectome to serve as the putative gate keeper of neural information for consciousness awareness. Our findings support and underscore prior theoretical contributions about the involvement of the claustrum in higher cognitive function and its relevance in devastating neurological disease.

Connectivity alterations, specifically in the right and left executive control networks (RECN/LECN) and the default mode network (DMN), may contribute to the addiction cycle. The objective of this study was to determine if executive control network (ECN) and DMN connectivity is different between non-smokers and smokers and whether reductions in connectivity are related to chronic cigarette use. The RECN, LECN, and DMN were identified in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in 650 subjects. Analyses tested for group differences in network connectivity strength, controlling for age and alcohol use. There was a significant group effect on LECN and DMN connectivity strength with smokers (n=452) having lower network strengths than non-smokers (n=198). Smokers had lower connectivity than non-smokers associated with key network hubs: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and parietal nodes within ECNs. Further, ECN connectivity strength was negatively associated with pack years of cigarette use.

83,83,"Most of the previous task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies found abnormalities in distributed brain regions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and few studies investigated the brain network dysfunction from the system level. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to examine brain network dysfunction in MCI and AD. We systematically searched task-based fMRI studies in MCI and AD published between January 1990 and January 2014. Activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses were conducted to compare the significant group differences in brain activation, the significant voxels were overlaid onto seven referenced neuronal cortical networks derived from the resting-state fMRI data of 1,000 healthy participants. Thirty-nine task-based fMRI studies (697 MCI patients and 628 healthy controls) were included in MCI-related meta-analysis while 36 task-based fMRI studies (421 AD patients and 512 healthy controls) were included in AD-related meta-analysis. The meta-analytic results revealed that MCI and AD showed abnormal regional brain activation as well as large-scale brain networks. MCI patients showed hypoactivation in default, frontoparietal, and visual networks relative to healthy controls, whereas AD-related hypoactivation mainly located in visual, default, and ventral attention networks relative to healthy controls. Both MCI-related and AD-related hyperactivation fell in frontoparietal, ventral attention, default, and somatomotor networks relative to healthy controls. MCI and AD presented different pathological while shared similar compensatory large-scale networks in fulfilling the cognitive tasks.

84,84,"This paper reports a dynamic causal modeling study of electrocorticographic (ECoG) data that addresses functional asymmetries between forward and backward connections in the visual cortical hierarchy. Specifically, we ask whether forward connections employ gamma-band frequencies, while backward connections preferentially use lower (beta-band) frequencies. We addressed this question by modeling empirical cross spectra using a neural mass model equipped with superficial and deep pyramidal cell populations-that model the source of forward and backward connections, respectively. This enabled us to reconstruct the transfer functions and associated spectra of specific subpopulations within cortical sources. We first established that Bayesian model comparison was able to discriminate between forward and backward connections, defined in terms of their cells of origin. We then confirmed that model selection was able to identify extrastriate (V4) sources as being hierarchically higher than early visual (V1) sources. Finally, an examination of the auto spectra and transfer functions associated with superficial and deep pyramidal cells confirmed that forward connections employed predominantly higher (gamma) frequencies, while backward connections were mediated by lower (alpha/beta) frequencies. We discuss these findings in relation to current views about alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations and predictive coding in the brain. (C) 2015 The Authors.

85,85,"Many young adults who attempt suicide have no discernible mental illness, suggesting an etiology distinct from other psychiatric disorders. Neurological anomalies associated with a history of suicidal behavior may predict future risk. In the present study, we explored changes in neural circuit organization associated with suicidal behavior by comparing local synchronization of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals in suicide attempters without a psychiatric diagnosis (SA group, 19.84 +/- 1.61 years, n=19) with those in healthy controls (HC group, 20.30 +/- 1.72 years, n=20) using regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis. The SA group exhibited significantly lower mean ReHo in the left (L) fusiform and supraorbital inferior frontal gyri, L hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal and middle frontal gyri, right (R) angular gyros, and cerebellar lobules RVIII, RII, and LVI compared with the HC group. Conversely, in the SA group, ReHo was higher in the R supraorbital middle frontal gyrus, R inferior parietal lobe, and L precuncus. The SA group also had significantly higher total Barratt: Impulsiveness Scale scores compared with the HC group. Local functional connectivity is altered in multiple regions of the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and cerebellum of suicidal young adults. Elucidating the functional deficits associated with these ReHo changes may clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms of suicidal behavior and assist in identifying high-risk individuals.

86,86,"The clinical high risk (CUR) period is a phase denoting a risk for overt psychosis during which subacute symptoms often appear, and cognitive functions may deteriorate. To compare biological indices during this phase with those during first episode schizophrenia, we cross-sectionally examined sex- and age-matched clinical high risk (CHR, n=21), first episode schizophrenia patients (FESZ, n=20) and matched healthy controls (HC, n=25) on oddball and novelty paradigms and assessed the N100, P200, P3a and P3b as indices of perceptual, attentional and working memory processes. To our knowledge, this is the only such comparison using all of these event-related potentials (ERPs) in two paradigms. We hypothesized that the ERPs would differentiate between the three groups and allow prediction of a diagnostic group. The majority of ERPs were significantly affected in CUR and FESZ compared with controls, with similar effect sizes. Nonetheless, in logistic regression, only the P3a and N100 distinguished CUR and FESZ from healthy controls, suggesting that ERPs not associated with an overt task might be more sensitive to prediction of group membership.

87,87,"Grey matter volume and cortical thickness are [he two most widely used measures for detecting grey matter morphometric changes in various diseases such as schizophrenia. However, these two measures only share partial overlapping regions in identifying morphometric changes. Few studies have investigated the contributions of the potential factors to the differences of grey matter volume and cortical thickness. To investigate this question, 3 T magnetic resonance images from 22 patients with schizophrenia and 20 well-matched healthy controls were chosen for analyses. Grey matter volume and cortical thickness were measured by VBM and Freesurfer. Grey matter volume results were then rendered onto the surface template of Freesurfer to compare the differences from cortical thickness in anatomical locations. Discrepancy regions of the grey matter volume and thickness where grey matter volume significantly decreased but without corresponding evidence of cortical thinning involved the rostral middle frontal, precentral, lateral occipital and superior frontal gyri. Subsequent region-of-interest analysis demonstrated that changes in surface area, grey/white matter intensity contrast and curvature accounted for the discrepancies. Our results suggest that the differences between grey matter volume and thickness could be jointly driven by surface area, grey/white matter intensity contrast and curvature.

88,88,"Subjective well-being is assumed to be distributed in the hedonic hotspots of subcortical and cortical structures. However, the precise neural correlates underlying this construct, especially how it is maintained during the resting state, are still largely unknown. Here, we explored the neural basis of subjective well-being by correlating the regional fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) with the self-reported subjective well-being of healthy individuals. Behaviorally, we demonstrated that subjective well-being contained two related but distinct components: cognitive and affective well-being. Neurally, we showed that the fALFF in the bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), right posterior mid-cingulate cortex (pMCC), right thalamus, left postcentral gyrus (PCG), right lingual gyrus, and left planum temporale (PT) positively predicted cognitive well-being, whereas the fALFF in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) negatively predicted cognitive well-being. In contrast, only the fALFF in the right amygdala reliably predicted affective well-being. Furthermore, emotional intelligence partiallymediated the effects of the right pSTG and thalamus on cognitive well-being, as well as the effect of the right amygdala on affectivewell-being. In summary, we provide the first evidence that spontaneous brain activity inmultiple regions associated with sensation, social perception, cognition, and emotion contributes to cognitive well-being, whereas the spontaneous brain activity in only one emotion-related region contributes to affective well-being, suggesting that the spontaneous activity of the human brain reflect the efficiency of subjective well-being.

89,89,"Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) spontaneous signals from resting-state (RS) brains have typically been characterized by low-pass filtered timeseries at frequencies <= 0.1 Hz, and studies of these low-frequency fluctuations have contributed exceptional understanding of the baseline functions of our brain. Very recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated that spontaneous activities may persist in higher frequency bands (even up to 0.8 Hz), while presenting less variable network patterns across the scan duration. However, as an indirect measure of neuronal activity, BOLD signal results from an inherently slow hemodynamic process, which in fact might be too slow to accommodate the observed high-frequency functional connectivity (FC). To examine whether the observed high-frequency spontaneous FC originates from BOLD contrast, we collected RS data as a function of echo time (TE). Here we focus on two specific resting state networks - the default-mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN), and the major findings are fourfold: (1) we observed BOLD-like linear TE-dependence in the spontaneous activity at frequency bands up to 0.5 Hz (the maximum frequency that can be resolved with TR=1 s), supporting neural relevance of the RSFC at a higher frequency range; (2) conventional models of hemodynamic response functions must be modified to support resting state BOLD contrast, especially at higher frequencies; (3) there are increased fractions of non-BOLD-like contributions to the RSFC above the conventional 0.1 Hz (non-BOLD/BOLD contrast at 0.4-0.5 Hz is similar to 4 times that at <0.1 Hz); and (4) the spatial patterns of RSFC are frequency-dependent. Possible mechanisms underlying the present findings and technical concerns regarding RSFC above 0.1 Hz are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

90,90,"Although the connectivity of hippocampal circuits has been extensively studied, the way in which these connections give rise to large-scale dynamic network activity remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetic fMRI to visualize the brain network dynamics evoked by different frequencies of stimulation of two distinct neuronal populations within dorsal and intermediate hippocampus. Stimulation of excitatory cells in intermediate hippocampus caused widespread cortical and subcortical recruitment at high frequencies, whereas stimulation in dorsal hippocampus led to activity primarily restricted to hippocampus across all frequencies tested. Sustained hippocampal responses evoked during high-frequency stimulation of either location predicted seizure-like after discharges in video-EEG experiments, while the widespread activation evoked by high-frequency stimulation of intermediate hippocampus predicted behavioral seizures. A negative BOLD signal observed in dentate gyrus during dorsal, but not intermediate, hippocampus stimulation is proposed to underlie the mechanism for these differences.

91,91,"Animal approach-avoidance conflict paradigms have been used extensively to operationalize anxiety, quantify the effects of anxiolytic agents, and probe the neural basis of fear and anxiety. Results from human neuroimaging studies support that a frontal-striatal-amygdala neural circuitry is important for approach-avoidance learning. However, the neural basis of decision-making is much less clear in this context. Thus, we combined a recently developed human approach-avoidance paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify neural substrates underlying approach-avoidance conflict decision-making. Fifteen healthy adults completed the approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) paradigm during fMRI. Analyses of variance were used to compare conflict to nonconflict (avoid-threat and approach-reward) conditions and to compare level of reward points offered during the decision phase. Trial-by-trial amplitude modulation analyses were used to delineate brain areas underlying decision-making in the context of approach/avoidance behavior. Conflict trials as compared to the nonconflict trials elicited greater activation within bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and caudate, as well as right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Right caudate and lateral PFC activation was modulated by level of reward offered. Individuals who showed greater caudate activation exhibited less approach behavior. On a trial-by-trial basis, greater right lateral PFC activation related to less approach behavior. Taken together, results suggest that the degree of activation within prefrontal-striatal-insula circuitry determines the degree of approach versus avoidance decision-making. Moreover, the degree of caudate and lateral PFC activation related to individual differences in approach-avoidance decision-making. Therefore, the approach-avoidance conflict paradigm is ideally suited to probe anxiety-related processing differences during approach-avoidance decision-making. Hum Brain Mapp 36:449-462, 2015.

92,92,"Are symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers coded differently in the brain? Neuronal data indicate that overlap in numerical tuning curves is a hallmark of the approximate, analogue nature of nonsymbolic number representation. Consequently, patterns of fMRI activity should be more correlated when the representational overlap between two numbers is relatively high. In bilateral intraparietal sulci (IPS), for nonsymbolic numbers, the pattern of voxelwise correlations between pairs of numbers mirrored the amount of overlap in their tuning curves under the assumption of approximate, analogue coding. In contrast, symbolic numbers showed a flat field of modest correlations more consistent with discrete, categorical representation (no systematic overlap between numbers). Directly correlating activity patterns for a given number across formats (e.g., the numeral 6 with six dots) showed no evidence of shared symbolic and nonsymbolic number-specific representations. Overall (univariate) activity in bilateral IPS was well fit by the log of the number being processed for both nonsymbolic and symbolic numbers. IPS activity is thus sensitive to numerosity regardless of format; however, the nature in which symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers are encoded is fundamentally different.

94,94,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for axon diameter mapping benefit from higher maximum gradient strengths than are currently available on commercial human scanners. Using a dedicated high-gradient 3 T human MRI scanner with a maximum gradient strength of 300 mT/m, we systematically studied the effect of gradient strength on in vivo axon diameter and density estimates in the human corpus callosum. Pulsed gradient spin echo experiments were performed in a single scan session lasting approximately 2 h on each of three human subjects. The data were then divided into subsets with maximum gradient strengths of 77, 145, 212, and 293 mT/m and diffusion times encompassing short (16 and 25 ms) and long (60 and 94 ms) diffusion time regimes. A three-compartment model of intra-axonal diffusion, extra-axonal diffusion, and free diffusion in cerebrospinal fluid was fitted to the data using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. For the acquisition parameters, model, and fitting routine used in our study, it was found that higher maximum gradient strengths decreased the mean axon diameter estimates by two to three fold and decreased the uncertainty in axon diameter estimates by more than half across the corpus callosum. The exclusive use of longer diffusion times resulted in axon diameter estimates that were up to two times larger than those obtained with shorter diffusion times. Axon diameter and density maps appeared less noisy and showed improved contrast between different regions of the corpus callosum with higher maximum gradient strength. Known differences in axon diameter and density between the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum were preserved and became more reproducible at higher maximum gradient strengths. Our results suggest that an optimal q-space sampling scheme for estimating in vivo axon diameters should incorporate the highest possible gradient strength.

95,95,"Growing interest has developed in hippocampal subfield volumetry over the past few years and an increasing number of studies use the automatic segmentation algorithm implemented in FreeSurfer. However, this approach has not been validated on standard resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) as used in most studies. We aimed at comparing hippocampal subfield segmentation using FreeSurfer on standard T1-weighted images versus manual delineation on dedicated high-resolution hippocampal scans. Hippocampal subfields were segmented in 133 individuals including 98 cognitively normal controls aged 19-84 years, 17 mild cognitive impairment and 18 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using both methods. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were computed to assess the consistency between both methods, and the effects of age and diagnosis were assessed from both measures. Low to moderate ICC (0.31-0.74) were found for the subiculum and other subfields as well as for the whole hippocampus, and the correlations were very low for cornu ammonis (CA)1 (<0.1). FreeSurfer CA1 volume estimates were found to be much lower than those obtained from manual segmentation, and this bias was proportional to the volume of this structure so that no effect of age or AD could be detected on FreeSurfer CA1 volumes. This study points to the differences in the anatomic definition of the subfields between FreeSurfer and manual delineation, especially for CA1, and provides clue for improvement of this automatic technique for potential clinical application on standard T1-weighted MR.

Accordingly, in this paper we propose a manifold regularized multitask feature learning method to preserve both the intrinsic relatedness among multiple modalities of data and the data distribution information in each modality. Specifically, we denote the feature learning on each modality as a single task, and use group-sparsity regularizer to capture the intrinsic relatedness among multiple tasks (i.e., modalities) and jointly select the common features from multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new manifold-based Laplacian regularizer to preserve the data distribution information from each task. Finally, we use the multikernel support vector machine method to fuse multimodality data for eventual classification. Conversely, we also extend our method to the semisupervised setting, where only partial data are labeled.

97,97,"Thalamic atrophy is known to be one of the most important predictors for clinical dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS). As the thalamus is highly connected to many cortical areas, this suggests that thalamic atrophy is associated with disruption of cortical functional networks. We investigated this thalamo-cortical system to explain the presence of physical and cognitive problems in MS. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) were performed in 86 MS patients and 21 healthy subjects. We computed cortical functional networks for fMRI and MEG by respectively the Pearson's correlation coefficient and the phase lag index using the same automated anatomical labeling atlas for both modalities. Thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was only estimated using fMRI. We computed conventional network metrics such as clustering coefficient and path length and analyzed the minimum spanning tree (MST), a subnetwork and backbone of the original network. MS patients showed reduced thalamic volumes and increased thalamo-cortical connectivity. MEG cortical functional networks showed a lower level of integration in MS in terms of the MST, whereas fMRI cortical networks did not differ between groups. Lower integration of MEG cortical functional networks was both related to thalamic atrophy as well as to increased thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in fMRI and to worse cognitive and clinical status. This study demonstrated for the first time that thalamic atrophy is associated with global disruption of cortical functional networks in MS and this global disruption of network activity was related to worse cognitive and clinical function in MS.

98,98,"Objectives: Anticipatory processes prepare the organism for upcoming experiences. The aim of this study was to investigate neural responses related to anticipation and processing of painful stimuli occurring with different levels of uncertainty. Experimental design: Twenty-five participants (13 females) took part in an electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment at separate times. A visual cue announced the occurrence of an electrical painful or nonpainful stimulus, delivered with certainty or uncertainty (50% chance), at some point during the following 15 s. Principal observations: During the first 2 s of the anticipation phase, a strong effect of uncertainty was reflected in a pronounced frontal stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and increased fMRI activation in higher visual processing areas. In the last 2 s before stimulus delivery, we observed stimulus-specific preparatory processes indicated by a centroparietal SPN and posterior insula activation that was most pronounced for the certain pain condition. Uncertain anticipation was associated with attentional control processes. During stimulation, the results revealed that unexpected painful stimuli produced the strongest activation in the affective pain processing network and a more pronounced offset-P2. Conclusions: Our results reflect that during early anticipation uncertainty is strongly associated with affective mechanisms and seems to be a more salient event compared to certain anticipation. During the last 2 s before stimulation, attentional control mechanisms are initiated related to the increased salience of uncertainty. Furthermore, stimulus-specific preparatory mechanisms during certain anticipation also shaped the response to stimulation, underlining the adaptive value of stimulus-targeted preparatory activity which is less likely when facing an uncertain event.

99,99,"Multi-atlas patch-based label fusion methods have been successfully used to improve segmentation accuracy in many important medical image analysis applications. In general, to achieve label fusion a single target image is first registered to several atlas images. After registration a label is assigned to each target point in the target image by determining the similarity between the underlying target image patch (centered at the target point) and the aligned image patch in each atlas image. To achieve the highest level of accuracy during the label fusion process it's critical for the chosen patch similarity measurement to accurately capture the tissue/shape appearance of the anatomical structure. One major limitation of existing state-of-the-art label fusion methods is that they often apply a fixed size image patch throughout the entire label fusion procedure. Doing so may severely affect the fidelity of the patch similarity measurement, which in turn may not adequately capture complex tissue appearance patterns expressed by the anatomical structure. To address this limitation, we advance state-of-the-art by adding three new label fusion contributions: First, each image patch is now characterized by a multi-scale feature representation that encodes both local and semi-local image information. Doing so will increase the accuracy of the patch-based similarity measurement. Second, to limit the possibility of the patch-based similarity measurement being wrongly guided by the presence of multiple anatomical structures in the same image patch, each atlas image patch is further partitioned into a set of label-specific partial image patches according to the existing labels. Since image information has now been semantically divided into different patterns, these new label-specific atlas patches make the label fusion process more specific and flexible. Lastly, in order to correct target points that are mislabeled during label fusion, a hierarchical approach is used to improve the label fusion results. In particular, a coarse-to-fine iterative label fusion approach is used that gradually reduces the patch size. To evaluate the accuracy of our label fusion approach, the proposed method was used to segment the hippocampus in the ADNI dataset and 7.0 T MR images, sub-cortical regions in LONI LBPA40 dataset, mid-brain regions in SATA dataset from MICCAI 2013 segmentation challenge, and a set of key internal gray matter structures in IXI dataset. In all experiments, the segmentation results of the proposed hierarchical label fusion method with multi-scale feature representations and label-specific atlas patches are more accurate than several well-known state-of-the-art label fusion methods.

100,100,"Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) fMRI (rs-fcMRI) offers an appealing approach to mapping the brain's intrinsic functional organization. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) are the two main rs-fcMRI approaches to assess alterations in brain networks associated with individual differences, behavior and psychopathology. While the BOLD signal is stronger with a higher temporal resolution, ASL provides quantitative, direct measures of the physiology and metabolism of specific networks. This study systematically investigated the similarity and reliability of resting brain networks (RBNs) in BOLD and ASL. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was employed where each subject underwent repeated BOLD and ASL rs-fcMRI scans on two occasions on two MRI scanners respectively. Both independent and joint FC analyses revealed common RBNs in ASL and BOLD rs-fcMRI with a moderate to high level of spatial overlap, verified by Dice Similarity Coefficients. Test-retest analyses indicated more reliable spatial network patterns in BOLD (average modal Intraclass Correlation Coefficients: 0.905 +/- 0.033 between-sessions; 0.885 +/- 0.052 between-scanners) than ASL (0.545 +/- 0.048; 0.575 +/- 0.059). Nevertheless, ASL provided highly reproducible (0.955 +/- 0.021; 0.970 +/- 0.011) network-specific CBF measurements. Moreover, we observed positive correlations between regional CBF and FC in core areas of all RBNs indicating a relationship between network connectivity and its baseline metabolism. Taken together, the combination of ASL and BOLD rs-fcMRI provides a powerful tool for characterizing the spatiotemporal and quantitative properties of RBNs.

101,101,"Cognitive control and working memory rely upon a common fronto-parietal network that includes the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC), pre-supplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (pSMA/dACC), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). This network is able to flexibly adapt its function in response to changing behavioral goals, mediating a wide range of cognitive demands. Here we apply dynamic causal modeling to functional magnetic resonance imaging data to characterize task-related alterations in the strength of network interactions across distinct cognitive processes. Evidence in favor of task-related connectivity dynamics was accrued across a very large space of possible network structures. Cognitive control and working memory demands were manipulated using a factorial combination of the multi-source interference task and a verbal 2-back working memory task, respectively. Both were found to alter the sensitivity of the IFJ to perceptual information, and to increase IFJ-to-pSMA/dACC connectivity. In contrast, increased connectivity from the pSMA/dACC to the IPS, as well as from the dIPFC to the IFJ, was uniquely driven by cognitive control demands; a task-induced negative influence of the dlPFC on the pSMA/dACC was specific to working memory demands. These results reflect a system of both shared and unique context-dependent dynamics within the fronto-parietal network. Mechanisms supporting cognitive engagement, response selection, and action evaluation may be shared across cognitive domains, while dynamic updating of task and context representations within this network are potentially specific to changing demands on cognitive control.

102,102,"Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) commonly display deficits in emotion regulation, but findings in the area of social cognitive (e.g., theory of mind, ToM) capacities have been heterogeneous. The aims of the current study were to investigate differences between patients with BPD and controls in functional connectivity (1) between the emotion and ToM network and (2) in the default mode network (DMN). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate 19 healthy controls and 17 patients with BPD at rest and during ToM processing. Functional coupling was analysed. Significantly decreased functional connectivity was found for patients compared with controls between anterior cingulate cortex and three brain areas involved in ToM processes: the left superior temporal lobe, right supramarginal/inferior parietal lobes, and right middle cingulate cortex. Increased functional connectivity was found in patients compared with controls between the precuneus as the DMN seed and the left inferior frontal lobe, left precentral/middle frontal, and left middle occipital/superior parietal lobes during rest. Reduced functional coupling between the emotional and the ToM network during ToM processing is in line with emotion-regulation dysfunctions in BPD. The increased connectivity between precuneus and frontal regions during rest might be related to extensive processing of internal thoughts and self-referential information in BPD.

Animal research into chronic stress, one of the most prominent environmental risk factors for development of psychopathology, has revealed molecular and cellular mechanisms potentially contributing to human mental disease. However, so far, these studies have not addressed the system-level changes in extended brain networks, thought to critically contribute to mental disorders. We here tested the effects of chronic stress exposure (10 days immobilization) on the structural integrity and functional connectivity patterns in the brain, using high-resolution structural MRI, diffusion kurtosis imaging, and resting-state functional MRI, while confirming the expected changes in neuronal dendritic morphology using Golgi-staining. Stress effectiveness was confirmed by a significantly lower body weight and increased adrenal weight. In line with previous research, stressed animals displayed neuronal dendritic hypertrophy in the amygdala and hypotrophy in the hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex. Using independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI data, we identified ten functional connectivity networks in the rodent brain. Chronic stress appeared to increase connectivity within the somatosensory, visual, and default mode networks. Moreover, chronic stress exposure was associated with an increased volume and diffusivity of the lateral ventricles, whereas no other volumetric changes were observed. This study shows that chronic stress exposure in rodents induces alterations in functional network connectivity strength which partly resemble those observed in stress-related psychopathology.

Although medial frontal regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are known to be involved in these functions, there is still considerable heterogeneity regarding their spatio-temporal activations. The timing of these functions has been associated with two separable event-related potentials (ERPs) usually localized to the medial frontal wall, one during error processing (ERN -error related negativity) and one during conflict monitoring (N2).

We demonstrate a spatial dissociation of conflict monitoring and error processing along the medial frontal wall, with selective conflict level dependent activation of the SMA/pre-SMA. Activation to error processing was located in the ACC, rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and pre-SMA.

Our fMRI findings clearly demonstrate that conflict monitoring and error processing are spatially dissociable along the medial frontal wall. Moreover, the overlap of ERN-and N2-informed fMRI activation in the pre-SMA provides new evidence that these ERP components share conflict related processing functions and are thus not completely separable. c 2014 Elsevier Inc.

105,105,"Themyelin content of the cortex changes over the human lifetime and aberrant cortical myelination is associated with diseases such as schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. Recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have shown potential in differentiating between myeloarchitectonically distinct cortical regions in vivo. Here we introduce a new algorithm for correcting partial volume effects present in mm-scale MRI images which was used to investigate the myelination pattern of the cerebral cortex in 1555 clinically normal subjects using the ratio of T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI images. A significant linear cross-sectional age increase in T1w/T2w estimated myelin was detected across an 18 to 35 year age span (highest value of similar to 1%/year compared to mean T1w/T2w myelin value at 18 years). The cortex was divided at mid-thickness and the value of T1w/T2w myelin calculated for the inner and outer layers separately. The increase in T1w/T2w estimated myelin occurs predominantly in the inner layer for most cortical regions. The ratio of the inner and outer layer T1w/T2w myelin was further validated using high-resolution in vivo MRI scans and also a high-resolution MRI scan of a postmortem brain. Additionally, the relationships between cortical thickness, curvature and T1w/T2w estimated myelin were found to be significant, although the relationships varied across the cortex. We discuss these observations as well as limitations of using the T1w/T2w ratio as an estimate of cortical myelin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

106,106,"Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) measures bulk susceptibilities in the brain, which can arise from many sources. In iron-rich subcortical gray matter (GM), non-heme iron is a dominant susceptibility source. We evaluated the use of QSM for iron mapping in subcortical GM by direct comparison to tissue iron staining. We performed in situ or in vivo QSM at 4.7 T combined with Perls' ferric iron staining on the corresponding extracted subcortical GM regions. This histochemical process enabled examination of ferric iron in complete slices that could be related to susceptibility measurements. Correlation analyses were performed on an individual-by individual basis and high linear correlations between susceptibility and Perls' iron stain were found for the three multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects studied (R-2 = 0.75, 0.62, 0.86). In addition, high linear correlations between susceptibility and transverse relaxation rate (R2*) were found (R-2 = 0.88, 0.88, 0.87) which matched in vivo healthy subjects (R-2 = 0.87). This work validates the accuracy of QSM for brain iron mapping and also confirms ferric iron as the dominant susceptibility source in subcortical GM, by demonstrating high linear correlation of QSM to Perls' ferric iron staining.

107,107,"Pattern recognition applied to whole-brain neuroimaging data, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has proved successful at discriminating psychiatric patients from healthy participants. However, predictive patterns obtained from whole-brain voxel-based features are difficult to interpret in terms of the underlying neurobiology. Many psychiatric disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, are thought to be brain connectivity disorders. Therefore, pattern recognition based on network models might provide deeper insights and potentially more powerful predictions than whole-brain voxel-based approaches. Here, we build a novel sparse network-based discriminative modeling framework, based on Gaussian graphical models and L1-norm regularized linear Support Vector Machines (SVM). In addition, the proposed framework is optimized in terms of both predictive power and reproducibility/stability of the patterns. Our approach aims to provide better pattern interpretation than voxel-based whole-brain approaches by yielding stable brain connectivity patterns that underlie discriminative changes in brain function between the groups. We illustrate our technique by classifying patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy participants, in two (event-and block-related) fMRI datasets acquiredwhile participants performed a gender discrimination and emotional task, respectively, during the visualization of emotional valent faces.

108,108,"Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by disabling symptoms and cognitive deficit. Recent neuroimaging findings suggest that large parts of the brain are affected by the disease, and that the capacity of functional integration between brain areas is decreased. In this study we questioned (i) which brain areas underlie the loss of network integration properties observed in the pathology, (ii) what is the topological role of the affected regions within the overall brain network and how this topological status might be altered in patients, and (iii) how white matter properties of tracts connecting affected regions may be disrupted. We acquired diffusion spectrum imaging (a technique sensitive to fiber crossing and slow diffusion compartment) data from 16 schizophrenia patients and 15 healthy controls, and investigated their weighted brain networks. The global connectivity analysis confirmed that patients present disrupted integration and segregation properties. The nodal analysis allowed identifying a distributed set of brain nodes affected in the pathology, including hubs and peripheral areas. To characterize the topological role of this affected core, we investigated the brain network shortest paths layout, and quantified the network damage after targeted attack toward the affected core. The centrality of the affected core was compromised in patients. Moreover the connectivity strength within the affected core, quantified with generalized fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient, was altered in patients. Taken together, these findings suggest that the structural alterations and topological decentralization of the affected core might be major mechanisms underlying the schizophrenia dysconnectivity disorder.

109,109,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that is associated with structural and functional alterations in several brain areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Here, we examine resting state functional connectivity of ACC subdivisions in PTSD, using a seed-based approach. Resting state magnetic resonance images were obtained from male veterans with (n=31) and without (n=25) PTSD, and healthy male civilian controls (n=25). Veterans with and without PTSD (combat controls) had reduced functional connectivity compared to healthy controls between the caudal ACC and the precentral gyrus, and between the perigenual ACC and the superior medial gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. Combat controls had increased connectivity between the rostral ACC and precentral/middle frontal gyrus compared to PTSD patients and healthy civilian controls. The resting state functional connectivity differences in the perigenual ACC network reported here indicate that veterans differ from healthy controls, potentially due to military training, deployment, and/or trauma exposure. In addition, specific alterations in the combat controls may potentially be related to resilience. These results underline the importance of distinguishing trauma-exposed (combat) controls from healthy civilian controls when studying PTSD. Hum Brain Mapp, 36:99-109, 2015.

110,110,"This study was conducted to examine the statistical influence of brain size on cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar compartmental volumes. This brain size influence was especially studied to delineate interactions with Sex and Age. Here, we studied 856 healthy subjects of which 533 are classified as young and 323 as old. Using an automated segmentation procedure cortical (gray and white matter [GM and WM] including the corpus callosum), cerebellar (GM and WM), and subcortical (thalamus, putamen, pallidum, caudatus, hippocampus, amygdala, and accumbens) volumes were measured and subjected to statistical analyses. These analyses revealed that brain size and age exert substantial statistical influences on nearly all compartmental volumes. Analyzing the raw compartmental volumes replicated the frequently reported Sex differences in compartmental volumes with men showing larger volumes. However, when statistically controlling for brain size Sex differences and Sex x Age interactions practically disappear. Thus, brain size is more important than Sex in explaining interindividual differences in compartmental volumes.

112,112,"Brain lateralization is a widely studied topic, however there has been little work focused on lateralization of intrinsic networks (regions showing similar patterns of covariation among voxels) in the resting brain. In this study, we evaluate resting state network lateralization in an age and gender-balanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset comprising over 600 healthy subjects ranging in age from 12 to 71. After establishing sample-wide network lateralization properties, we continue with an investigation of age and gender effects on network lateralization. All data was gathered on the same scanner and preprocessed using an automated pipeline (Scott et al., 2011). Networks were extracted via group independent component analysis (gICA) (Calhoun et al., 2001). Twenty-eight resting state networks discussed in previous (Allen et al., 2011) work were re-analyzed with a focus on lateralization. We calculated homotopic voxelwise measures of laterality in addition to a global lateralization measure, called the laterality cofactor, for each network. As expected, many of the intrinsic brain networks were lateralized. For example, the visual network was strongly right lateralized, auditory network and default mode networks were mostly left lateralized. Attentional and frontal networks included nodes that were left lateralized and other nodes that were right lateralized. Age was strongly related to lateralization in multiple regions including sensorimotor network regions precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and supramarginal gyrus; and visual network regions lingual gyrus; attentional network regions inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal lobule and middle temporal gyrus; and frontal network regions including the inferior frontal gyrus. Gender showed significant effects mainly in two regions, including visual and frontal networks. For example, the inferior frontal gyrus was more right lateralized in males. Significant effects of age were found in sensorimotor and visual networks on the global measure. In summary, we report a large-sample of lateralization study that finds intrinsic functional brain networks to be highly lateralized, with regions that are strongly related to gender and age locally, and with age a strong factor in lateralization, and gender exhibiting a trend-level effect on global measures of laterality.

113,113,"Adolescence is associated with quickly changing environmental demands which require excellent adaptive skills and high cognitive flexibility. Feedback-guided adaptive learning and cognitive flexibility are driven by reward prediction error (RPE) signals, which indicate the accuracy of expectations and can be estimated using computational models. Despite the importance of cognitive flexibility during adolescence, only little is known about how RPE processing in cognitive flexibility deviates between adolescence and adulthood. In this study, we investigated the developmental aspects of cognitive flexibility by means of computational models and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We compared the neural and behavioral correlates of cognitive flexibility in healthy adolescents (12-16 years) to adults performing a probabilistic reversal learning task. Using a modified risk-sensitive reinforcement learning model, we found that adolescents learned faster from negative RPEs than adults. The fMRI analysis revealed that within the RPE network, the adolescents had a significantly altered RPE-response in the anterior insula. This effect seemed to be mainly driven by increased responses to negative prediction errors. In summary, our findings indicate that decision making in adolescence goes beyond merely increased reward seeking behavior and provides a developmental perspective to the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility in the context of reinforcement learning.

115,115,"Since its introduction, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has been a powerful tool for investigating functional neural networks in both normal and pathological conditions. When measuring resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), most rsfMRI approaches do not consider its temporal variations and thus only provide the averaged RSFC over the scan time. Recently, there has been a surge of interest to investigate the dynamic characteristics of RSFC in humans, and promising results have been yielded. However, our knowledge regarding the dynamic RSFC in animals remains sparse. In the present study we utilized the single-volume co-activation method to systematically study the dynamic properties of RSFC within the networks of infralimbic cortex (IL) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in both awake and anesthetized rats. Our data showed that both IL and S1 networks could be decomposed into several spatially reproducible but temporally changing co-activation patterns (CAPs), suggesting that dynamic RSFC was indeed a characteristic feature in rodents. In addition, we demonstrated that anesthesia profoundly impacted the dynamic RSFC of neural circuits subserving cognitive and emotional functions but had less effects on sensorimotor systems. Finally, we examined the temporal characteristics of each CAP, and found that individual CAPs exhibited consistent temporal evolution patterns. Together, these results suggest that dynamic RSFC might be a general phenomenon in vertebrate animals. In addition, this study has paved the way for further understanding the alterations of dynamic RSFC in animal models of brain disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies support the existence of an altered excitation inhibition balance in PTSD. Further, there is preliminary evidence from blood sample studies suggesting heightened oxidative stress in PTSD, potentially leading to neural damage through excessive brain levels of free radicals. In this study we investigated PTSD (n=12) and non-PTSD participants (n=17) using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We found significantly higher levels of y-amino butyric acid (GABA) (a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter) and glutathione (a marker for neuronal oxidative stress) in PTSD participants.

117,117,"Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is highly variable across the duration of a scan. Groups of coevolving connections, or reproducible patterns of dynamic FC (dFC), have been revealed in fluctuating FC by applying unsupervised learning techniques. Based on results from k-means clustering and sliding-window correlations, it has recently been hypothesized that dFC may cycle through several discrete FC states. Alternatively, it has been proposed to represent dFC as a linear combination of multiple FC patterns using principal component analysis. As it is unclear whether sparse or nonsparse combinations of FC patterns are most appropriate, and as this affects their interpretation and use as markers of cognitive processing, the goal of our study was to evaluate the impact of sparsity by performing an empirical evaluation of simulated, task-based, and resting-state dFC. To this aim, we applied matrix factorizations subject to variable constraints in the temporal domain and studied both the reproducibility of ensuing representations of dFC and the expression of FC patterns over time. During subject-driven tasks, dFC was well described by alternating FC states in accordance with the nature of the data. The estimated FC patterns showed a rich structure with combinations of known functional networks enabling accurate identification of three different tasks. During rest, dFC was better described by multiple FC patterns that overlap. The executive control networks, which are critical for working memory, appeared grouped alternately with externally or internally oriented networks. These results suggest that combinations of FC patterns can provide a meaningful way to disentangle resting-state dFC. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5984-5995, 2014. (c) 2014 The Authors.

118,118,"Current perspectives on the evolutionary roots of human morality suggest it arose to incentivize social cooperation by promoting feelings of disgust toward selfish behavior, although the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate whether the ancient mammalian neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) influences self-referential processing in the domains of emotion evaluation and moral decision making, we conducted a pharmaco-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a behavioral experiment involving 157 healthy women and men who were treated with either OXT (24 IU) or placebo (PLC) intranasally. Our results show that OXT facilitated cortical midline responses during self-processing of disgust and selectively promoted self-interest moral judgments in men. In contrast, in women OXT increased the reaction time difference between accepted and rejected moral dilemmas and led them to suppress their self-interest and respond more altruistically for the benefit of others. Taken together, these findings suggest an OXT-related sexual dimorphism in human moral behavior which evolved adaptively to optimize both protection and nurturing of offspring by promoting selfish behavior in men and altruistic behavior in women.

119,119,"Lesion analysis is a classic approach to study brain functions. Because brain function is a result of coherent activations of a collection of functionally related voxels, lesion-symptom relations are generally contributed by multiple voxels simultaneously. Although voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) has made substantial contributions to the understanding of brain-behavior relationships, a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship contributed by multiple brain regions needs a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM). The purpose of this artilce was to develop an MLSM using a machine learning-based multivariate regression algorithm: support vector regression (SVR). In the proposed SVR-LSM, the symptom relation to the entire lesion map as opposed to each isolated voxel is modeled using a nonlinear function, so the intervoxel correlations are intrinsically considered, resulting in a potentially more sensitive way to examine lesion-symptom relationships. To explore the relative merits of VLSM and SVR-LSM we used both approaches in the analysis of a synthetic dataset. SVR-LSM showed much higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting the synthetic lesion-behavior relations than VLSM. When applied to lesion data and language measures from patients with brain damages, SVR-LSM reproduced the essential pattern of previous findings identified by VLSM and showed higher sensitivity than VLSM for identifying the lesion-behavior relations. Our data also showed the possibility of using lesion data to predict continuous behavior scores. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5861-5876, 2014.

We then compare this connection with the connections of the amygdala with emotion-related brain areas (superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, and lateral inferior frontal gyrus) and determine which amygdala nuclei are at the origin of these projections. Beyond the well-known subcortical influences over automatic and stereotypical emotional behaviors, a direct amygdala-motor pathway might provide a mechanism by which the amygdala can influence more complex motor behaviors.

121,121,"Attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are two of the most common and vexing neurodevelopmental disorders among children. Although the two disorders share many behavioral and neuropsychological characteristics, most MRI studies examine only one of the disorders at a time. Using graph theory combined with structural and functional connectivity, we examined the large-scale network organization among three groups of children: a group with ADHD (8-12 years, n=20), a group with ASD (7-13 years, n=16), and typically developing controls (TD) (8-12 years, n=20). We apply the concept of the rich-club organization, whereby central, highly connected hub regions are also highly connected to themselves. We examine the brain into two different network domains: (1) inside a rich-club network phenomena and (2) outside a rich-club network phenomena. The ASD and ADHD groups had markedly different patterns of rich club and non rich-club connections in both functional and structural data. The ASD group exhibited higher connectivity in structural and functional networks but only inside the rich-club networks. These findings were replicated using the autism brain imaging data exchange dataset with ASD (n=85) and TD (n=101). The ADHD group exhibited a lower generalized fractional anisotropy and functional connectivity inside the rich-club networks, but a higher number of axonal fibers and correlation coefficient values outside the rich club. Despite some shared biological features and frequent comorbity, these data suggest ADHD and ASD exhibit distinct large-scale connectivity patterns in middle childhood.

122,122,"Mapping mean axon diameter and intra-axonal volume fraction may have significant clinical potential because nerve conduction velocity is directly dependent on axon diameter, and several neurodegenerative diseases affect axons of specific sizes and alter axon counts. Diffusion-weightedMRI methods based on the pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence have been reported to be able to assess axon diameter and volume fraction non-invasively. However, due to the relatively long diffusion times used, e. g. >20 ms, the sensitivity to small axons (diameter < 2 mu m) is low, and the derived mean axon diameter has been reported to be overestimated. In the current study, oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion sequences with variable frequency gradients were used to assess rat spinal white matter tracts with relatively short effective diffusion times (1-5 ms). In contrast to previous PGSE-based methods, the extra-axonal diffusion cannot bemodeled as hindered (Gaussian) diffusion when short diffusion times are used. Appropriate frequency-dependent rates are therefore incorporated into our analysis and validated by histology-based computer simulation of water diffusion. OGSE data were analyzed to derive mean axon diameters and intra-axonal volume fractions of rat spinal white matter tracts (mean axon diameter of similar to 1.27-5.54 mu m). The estimated values were in good agreement with histology, including the small axon diameters (<2.5 mu m).

Inmost applications functional networks are assumed to be stationary, resulting in a single network estimated for the entire time course. However recent results suggest that the connectivity between brain regions is highly non-stationary even at rest. As a result, there is a need for new brain imaging methodologies that comprehensively account for the dynamic nature of functional networks. In this work we propose the Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso Estimation ( SINGLE) algorithm which estimates dynamic brain networks from fMRI data.

We identified 320 participants (93 cognitively normal or CN, 162 MCI, 65 AD) with baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and cognition data in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. We used independent component analysis (ICA) on structural MR images to derive 30 matter covariance patterns (ICs) across all participants. These ICs were used in iterative and stepwise discriminant classifier analyses to predict diagnostic classification at 24 months for CN vs. MCI, CN vs. AD, MCI vs. AD, and stable MCI (MCI-S) vs. MCI progression to AD (MCI-P). Models were cross-validated with a ""leave-10-out"" procedure. For CN vs. MCI, 84.7% accuracy was achieved based on cognitive performance measures, ICs, p-tau(181p), and ApoE epsilon 4 status. For CN vs. AD, 94.8% accuracy was achieved based on cognitive performance measures, ICs, and p-tau(181p). For MCI vs. AD and MCI-S vs. MCI-P, models achieved 83.1% and 80.3% accuracy, respectively, based on cognitive performance measures. ICs, and p-tau(181p).

Challenges are especially prevalent during the fMRI study of individual rodent brains, which could be instrumental to studies of disease progression and pharmacology. A recent advance in fMRI methodology enables unbiased, accurate, and comprehensive identification of functional BOLD signals by interfacing multi-echo (ME) fMRI acquisition, NMR signal decay analysis, and independent components analysis (ICA), in a procedure called ME-ICA. Here we present a pilot study on the suitability of ME-ICA for ultra high field animal fMRI studies of spontaneous brain activity under anesthesia. ME-ICA applied to 11.7 T fMRI data of rats first showed robust performance in automatic high dimensionality estimation and ICA decomposition, similar to that previously reported for 3.0 T human data. ME sequence optimization for 11.7 T indicated that 3 echoes, 0.5 mm isotropic voxel size and TR=3s was adequate for sensitive and specific BOLD signal acquisition. Next, in seeking optimal inhaled isoflurane anesthesia dosage, we report that progressive increase in anesthesia goes with concomitant decrease in statistical complexity of ""global"" functional activity, as measured by the number of BOLD components, or degrees of freedom(DOF).

127,127,"Background: Visual hallucinations (VH) are one of the most striking nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), and predict dementia and mortality. Aberrant default mode network (DMN) is associated with other psychoses. Here, we tested the hypothesis that DMN dysfunction contributes to VH in PD. Methods: Resting state functional data was acquired from individuals with PD with VH (PDVH) and without VH (PDnonVH), matched for levodopa drug equivalent dose, and a healthy control group (HC). Independent component analysis was used to investigate group differences in functional connectivity within the DMN. In addition, we investigated whether the functional changes associated with hallucinations were accompanied by differences in cortical thickness. Results: There were no group differences in cortical thickness but functional coactivation within components of the DMN was significantly lower in both PDVH and PDnonVH groups compared to HC. Functional coactivation within the DMN was found to be greater in PDVH group relative to PDnonVH group. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates, for the first time that, within a functionally abnormal DMN in PD, relatively higher connectivity is associated with VH. We postulate that aberrant connectivity in a large scale network affects sensory information processing and perception, and contributes to positive symptom generation in PD.

128,128,"We propose a generic method for the statistical analysis of collections of anatomical shape complexes, namely sets of surfaces that were previously segmented and labeled in a group of subjects. The method estimates an anatomical model, the template complex, that is representative of the population under study. Its shape reflects anatomical invariants within the dataset. In addition, the method automatically places control points near the most variable parts of the template complex. Vectors attached to these points are parameters of deformations of the ambient 3D space. These deformations warp the template to each subject's complex in a way that preserves the organization of the anatomical structures. Multivariate statistical analysis is applied to these deformation parameters to test for group differences. Results of the statistical analysis are then expressed in terms of deformation patterns of the template complex, and can be visualized and interpreted. The user needs only to specify the topology of the template complex and the number of control points. The method then automatically estimates the shape of the template complex, the optimal position of control points and deformation parameters. The proposed approach is completely generic with respect to any type of application and well adapted to efficient use in clinical studies, in that it does not require point correspondence across surfaces and is robust to mesh imperfections such as holes, spikes, inconsistent orientation or irregular meshing. The approach is illustrated with a neuroimaging study of Down syndrome (DS). The results demonstrate that the complex of deep brain structures shows a statistically significant shape difference between control and DS subjects. The deformation-based modelingis able to classify subjects with very high specificity and sensitivity, thus showing important generalization capability even given a low sample size. We show that the results remain significant even if the number of control points, and hence the dimension of variables in the statistical model, are drastically reduced. The analysis may even suggest that parsimonious models have an increased statistical performance.

Event-related potential (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified reward processing deficits in MDD, but these methods have yet to be applied together in a single MDD sample. We utilized multimodal neuroimaging evidence to examine reward dysfunction in MDD. Further, we explored how neurobiological reward dysfunction would map onto subtypes of MDD. The feedback negativity (FN), an ERP index of reward evaluation, was recorded in 34 unmedicated depressed individuals and 42 never-depressed controls during a laboratory gambling task. Ventral striatal (VS) activation to reward was recorded in a separate fMRI session, using an identical task, among a subgroup of 24 depressed individuals and a comparison group of 18 non-depressed controls. FN amplitude was blunted in MDD. This effect was driven by a MDD subgroup characterized by impaired mood reactivity to positive events, a core feature of melancholic MDD. A similar pattern was observed for VS activation, which was also blunted among the MDD subgroup with impaired mood reactivity. Neither FN amplitude nor VS activation was related to the full, DSM-defined melancholic or atypical MDD subtypes. Across the MDD sample, FN amplitude and VS activation were correlated, indicating convergence across methods. These results indicate that not all MDD is characterized by reward dysfunction, and that there is meaningful heterogeneity in reward processing within MDD.

130,130,"An important aspect of hearing is the degree to which listeners have to deploy effort to understand speech. One promising measure of listening effort is task-evoked pupil dilation. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the neural correlates of pupil dilation during comprehension of degraded spoken sentences in 17 normal-hearing listeners. Subjects listened to sentences degraded in three different ways: the target female speech was masked by fluctuating noise, by speech from a single male speaker, or the target speech was noise-vocoded. The degree of degradation was individually adapted such that 50% or 84% of the sentences were intelligible. Control conditions included clear speech in quiet, and silent trials. The peak pupil dilation was larger for the 50% compared to the 84% intelligibility condition, and largest for speech masked by the single-talker masker, followed by speech masked by fluctuating noise, and smallest for noise-vocoded speech. Activation in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) showed the same pattern, with most extensive activation for speech masked by the single-talker masker. Larger peak pupil dilation was associated with more activation in the bilateral STG, bilateral ventral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and several frontal brain areas. A subset of the temporal region sensitive to pupil dilation was also sensitive to speech intelligibility and degradation type. These results show that pupil dilation during speech perception in challenging conditions reflects both auditory and cognitive processes that are recruited to cope with degraded speech and the need to segregate target speech from interfering sounds.

131,131,"Emotions are an indispensable part of our mental life. The term emotion regulation refers to those processes that influence the generation, the experience and the expression of emotions. There is a great variety of strategies to regulate emotions efficiently, which are used in daily life and that have been investigated by cognitive neuroscience. Distraction guides attention to a secondary task. Reinterpretation, a variant of cognitive reappraisal, works by changing the meaning of an emotional stimulus. Detachment, another reappraisal strategy, refers to distancing oneself from an emotional stimulus, thereby reducing its personal relevance. Expressive Suppression modifies the behavioral or physiological response to an emotional stimulus. These four strategies are not equally effective in terms of emotion regulation success and have been shown to partly rely on different neuronal systems. Here, we compare for the first time the neural mechanisms of these typical strategies directly in a common functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of downregulation of negative emotions. Our results indicate that three of those strategies (Detachment, Expressive Suppression and Distraction) conjointly increase brain activation in a right prefronto-parietal regulation network and significantly reduce activation of the left amygdala. Compared to the other regulation strategies, Reinterpretation specifically recruited a different control network comprising left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal gyrus and was not effective in downregulation of the amygdala. We conclude that Detachment, Distraction and Expressive Suppression recruit very similar emotion regulation networks, whereas Reinterpretation is associated with activation of a qualitatively different network, making this regulation strategy a special one. Notably, Reinterpretation also proved to be the least effective strategy in neural terms, as measured by downregulation of amygdala activation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

132,132,"A primary goal in cognitive neuroscience is to identify neural correlates of conscious perception (NCC). By contrasting conditions in which subjects are aware versus unaware of identical visual stimuli, a number of candidate NCCs have emerged; among them are induced gamma band activity in the EEG and the P3 event-related potential. In most previous studies, however, the critical stimuli were always directly relevant to the subjects' task, such that aware versus unaware contrasts may well have included differences in post-perceptual processing in addition to differences in conscious perception per se. Here, in a series of EEG experiments, visual awareness and task relevance were manipulated independently. Induced gamma activity and the P3 were absent for task-irrelevant stimuli regardless of whether subjects were aware of such stimuli. For task-relevant stimuli, gamma and the P3 were robust and dissociable, indicating that each reflects distinct post-perceptual processes necessary for carrying-out the task but not for consciously perceiving the stimuli. Overall, this pattern of results challenges a number of previous proposals linking gamma band activity and the P3 to conscious perception. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here, in a series of EEG experiments, visual awareness and task relevance were manipulated independently. Induced gamma activity and the P3 were absent for task-irrelevant stimuli regardless of whether subjects were aware of such stimuli. For task-relevant stimuli, gamma and the P3 were robust and dissociable, indicating that each reflects distinct post-perceptual processes necessary for carrying-out the task but not for consciously perceiving the stimuli. Overall, this pattern of results challenges a number of previous proposals linking gamma band activity and the P3 to conscious perception. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

133,133,"Introduction: The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is emerging as a powerful tool for causally investigating cortical mechanisms and networks. However, various artefacts contaminate TMS-EEG recordings, particularly over regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The aim of this study was to substantiate removal of artefacts from TMS-EEG recordings following stimulation of the DLPFC and motor cortex using independent component analysis (ICA). Methods: 36 healthy volunteers (30.8 +/- 9 years, 9 female) received 75 single TMS pulses to the left DLPFC or left motor cortex while EEG was recorded from 57 electrodes. A subset of 9 volunteers also received 50 sham pulses. The large TMS artefact and early muscle activity (-2 to similar to 15 ms) were removed using interpolation and the remaining EEG signal was processed in two separate ICA runs using the FastICA algorithm. Five sub-types of TMS-related artefacts were manually identified: remaining muscle artefacts, decay artefacts, blink artefacts, auditory-evoked potentials and other noise-related artefacts. The cause of proposed blink and auditory-evoked potentials was assessed by concatenating known artefacts (i.e. voluntary blinks or auditory-evoked potentials resulting from sham TMS) to the TMS trials before ICA and evaluating grouping of resultant independent components (ICs). Finally, we assessed the effect of removing specific artefact types on TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and TMS-evoked oscillations. Results: Over DLPFC, ICs from proposed muscle and decay artefacts correlated with TMS-evoked muscle activity size, whereas proposed TMS-evoked blink ICs combined with voluntary blinks and auditory ICs with auditory-evoked potentials from sham TMS. Individual artefact sub-types characteristically distorted each measure of DLPFC function across the scalp. When free of artefact, TEPs and TMS-evoked oscillations could be measured following DLPFC stimulation. Importantly, characteristic TEPs following motor cortex stimulation (N15, P30, N45, P60, N100) could be recovered from artefactual data, corroborating the reliability of ICA-based artefact correction. Conclusions: Various different artefacts contaminate TMS-EEG recordings over the DLPFC and motor cortex. However, these artefacts can be removed with apparent minimal impact on neural activity using ICA, allowing the study of TMS-evoked cortical network properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

135,135,"For accurate EEG/MEG source analysis it is necessary to model the head volume conductor as realistic as possible. This includes the distinction of the different conductive compartments in the human head. In this study, we investigated the influence of modeling/not modeling the conductive compartments skull spongiosa, skull compacta, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter, and white matter and of the inclusion of white matter anisotropy on the EEG/MEG forward solution. Therefore, we created a highly realistic 6-compartment head model with white matter anisotropy and used a state-of-the-art finite element approach. Starting from a 3-compartment scenario (skin, skull, and brain), we subsequently refined our head model by distinguishing one further of the above-mentioned compartments. For each of the generated five head models, we measured the effect on the signal topography and signal magnitude both in relation to a highly resolved reference model and to the model generated in the previous refinement step. We evaluated the results of these simulations using a variety of visualization methods, allowing us to gain a general overview of effect strength, of the most important source parameters triggering these effects, and of the most affected brain regions. Thereby, starting from the 3-compartment approach, we identified the most important additional refinement steps in head volume conductor modeling. We were able to show that the inclusion of the highly conductive CSF compartment, whose conductivity value is well known, has the strongest influence on both signal topography and magnitude in both modalities. We found the effect of gray/white matter distinction to be nearly as big as that of the CSF inclusion, and for both of these steps we identified a clear pattern in the spatial distribution of effects. In comparison to these two steps, the introduction of white matter anisotropy led to a clearly weaker, but still strong, effect. Finally, the distinction between skull spongiosa and compacta caused the weakest effects in both modalities when using an optimized conductivity value for the homogenized compartment. We conclude that it is highly recommendable to include the CSF and distinguish between gray and white matter in head volume conductor modeling. Especially for the MEG, the modeling of skull spongiosa and compacta might be neglected due to the weak effects; the simplification of not modeling white matter anisotropy is admissible considering the complexity and current limitations of the underlying modeling approach.

137,137,"It has been proposed that the P3b component of event-related potentials (ERPs) reflects linking of responses to target stimuli. This proposal was tested by disconnecting the temporal link between target stimuli and responses, and by applying residue iteration decomposition (RIDE) for separating the ERP components into stimulus-locked, response-locked, and ""intermediate"" clusters. Left or right keys had to be pressed in response to frequent (80%) and rare (20%) target letters, but responses had to wait for ""go"" signals (appearing in 90% of trials). Between blocks, stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs) from targets to go-signals varied from 0 ms to 800 ms. Rare targets with their rare responses were expected to evoke large P3bs (""oddball effect""). If related to stimulus processing only, this effect will be equally large across all SOAs and will be modeled by RIDE's stimulus-cluster. If related to response initiation only, the oddball effect will be evoked by go-signals rather than by targets and will be modeled by RIDE's response-cluster. If indicating integration of rare stimuli with their rare responses, the oddball effect will be evoked by targets but will be reduced and stretched in time across SOAs and will be modeled by RIDE's intermediate cluster. RIDE analysis confirmed this latter view, for the most part. SOA effects matched best, though not perfectly, predictions made by the stimulus-response-link view. These results call for a refined account of the oddball effect on P3b in terms of stimulus-response coupling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

138,138,"Dopaminergic networks modulate neural processing across a spectrum of function from perception to learning to action. Multiple organizational schemes based on anatomy and function have been proposed for dopaminergic nuclei in the midbrain. One schema originating in rodent models delineated ventral tegmental area (VTA), implicated in complex behaviors like addiction, from more lateral substantia nigra (SN), preferentially implicated in movement. However, because anatomy and function in rodent midbrain differs from the primate midbrain in important ways, the utility of this distinction for human neuroscience has been questioned. We asked whether functional definition of networks within the human dopaminergic midbrain would recapitulate this traditional anatomical topology. We first developed a method for reliably defining SN and VTA in humans at conventional MRI resolution. Hand-drawn VTA and SN regions-of-interest (ROIs) were constructed for 50 participants, using individually-localized anatomical landmarks and signal intensity. Individual segmentation was used in seed-based functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional MRI data; results of this analysis recapitulated traditional anatomical targets of the VTA versus SN. Next, we constructed a probabilistic atlas of the VTA, SN, and the dopaminergic midbrain region (comprised of SN plus VTA) from individual hand-drawn ROIs. The combined probabilistic (SN plus VTA) ROI was then used for connectivity-based dual-regression analysis in two independent resting-state datasets (n=69 and n=79).

141,141,"We investigated whether intensive computerized cognitive training in schizophrenia could improve working memory performance and increase signal efficiency of associated middle frontal gyri (MFG) circuits in a functionally meaningful manner. Thirty schizophrenia participants and 13 healthy comparison participants underwent fMRI scanning during a letter N-back working memory task. Schizophrenia participants were then randomly assigned to either 80 h (16 weeks) of cognitive training or a computer games control condition. After this intervention, participants completed a second fMRI N-back scanning session. At baseline, during 2-back working memory trials, healthy participants showed the largest and most significant activation in bilateral MFG, which correlated with task performance. Schizophrenia participants showed impaired working memory, hypoactivation in left MFG, and no correlation between bilateral MFG signal and task performance. After training, schizophrenia participants improved their 2-back working memory performance and showed increased activation in left MFG. They also demonstrated a significant association between enhanced task performance and right MFG signal, similar to healthy participants. Both task performance and brain activity in right MFG after training predicted better generalized working memory at 6-month follow-up. Furthermore, task performance and brain activity within bilateral MFG predicted better occupational functioning at 6-month follow-up. No such findings were observed in the computer games control participants. Working memory impairments in schizophrenia and its underlying neural correlates in MFG can be improved by intensive computerized cognitive training; these improvements generalize beyond the trained task and are associated with enduring effects on cognition and functioning 6 months after the intervention.

142,142,"We generated probabilistic area maps and maximum probability maps (MPMs) for a set of 18 retinotopic areas previously mapped in individual subjects (Georgieva et al., 2009 and Kolster et al., 2010) using four different inter-subject registration methods. The best results were obtained using a recently developed multimodal surface matching method. The best set of MPMs had relatively smooth borders between visual areas and group average area sizes that matched the typical size in individual subjects. Comparisons between retinotopic areas and maps of estimated cortical myelin content revealed the following correspondences: (i) areas V1, V2, and V3 are heavily myelinated; (ii) the MT cluster is heavily myelinated, with a peak near the MT/pMSTv border; (iii) a dorsal myelin density peak corresponds to area V3D; (iv) the phPIT cluster is lightly myelinated; and (v) myelin density differs across the four areas of the V3A complex. Comparison of the retinotopic MPM with cytoarchitectonic areas, including those previously mapped to the fs_LR cortical surface atlas, revealed a correspondence between areas V1-3 and hOc1-3, respectively, but little correspondence beyond V3. These results indicate that architectonic and retinotopic areal boundaries are in agreement in some regions, and that retinotopy provides a finer-grained parcellation in other regions. The atlas datasets from this analysis are freely available as a resource for other studies that will benefit from retinotopic and myelin density map landmarks in human visual cortex.

143,143,"All neuroimaging packages can handle group analysis with t-tests or general linear modeling (GLM). However, they are quite hamstrung when there are multiple within-subject factors or when quantitative covariates are involved in the presence of a within-subject factor. In addition, sphericity is typically assumed for the variance-co-variance structure when there are more than two levels in a within-subject factor. To overcome such limitations in the traditional AN(C)OVA and GLM, we adopt a multivariate modeling (MVM) approach to analyzing neuroimaging data at the group level with the following advantages: a) there is no limit on the number of factors as long as sample sizes are deemed appropriate; b) quantitative covariates can be analyzed together with within-subject factors; c) when a within-subject factor is involved, three testing methodologies are provided: traditional univariate testing (UVT) with sphericity assumption (UVT-UC) and with correction when the assumption is violated (UVT-SC), and within-subject multivariate testing (MVT-WS); d) to correct for sphericity violation at the voxel level, we propose a hybrid testing (FIT) approach that achieves equal or higher power via combining traditional sphericity correction methods (Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt) with MVT-WS. To validate the MVM methodology, we performed simulations to assess the controllability for false positives and power achievement. A real FMRI dataset was analyzed to demonstrate the capability of the MVM approach. The methodology has been implemented into an open source program 3dMVM in AFNI, and all the statistical tests can be performed through symbolic coding with variable names instead of the tedious process of dummy coding. Our data indicates that the severity of sphericity violation varies substantially across brain regions. The differences among various modeling methodologies were addressed through direct comparisons between the MVM approach and some of the GLM implementations in the field, and the following two issues were raised: a) the improper formulation of test statistics in some univariate GLM implementations when a within-subject factor is involved in a data structure with two or more factors, and b) the unjustified presumption of uniform sphericity violation and the practice of estimating the variance-covariance structure through pooling across brain regions.

Further, we observed a simultaneous decrease in putamen (r = -.33) and ventral pallidum (r = -.45) response during milkshake receipt that occurred over repeated exposures, putatively reflecting food reward habitation. We then tested whether cue-reward learning and habituation slopes predicted future weight over 2-year follow-up. Those who exhibited the greatest escalation in ventral pallidum responsivity to cues and the greatest decrease in caudate response to milkshake receipt showed significantly larger increases in BMI (r = .39 and -.69 respectively). Interestingly, cue-reward learning propensity and food reward habituation were not correlated, implying that these factors may constitute qualitatively distinct vulnerability pathways to excess weight gain. These two individual difference factors may provide insight as to why certain people have shown obesity onset in response to the current obesogenic environment in western cultures, whereas others have not.

146,146,"Evidence suggests that the cerebellum contributes to cognition as well as motor function. We investigated cerebellar grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) changes from magnetic resonance images in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy older subjects using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Subjects (39 controls, 41 DLB, and 48 AD) underwent magnetic resonance imaging as well as clinical and cognitive assessments. VBM used SPM8 with a cerebellar brain mask to define the subspace for voxel analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using the general linear model. Relative to findings in controls, VBM analysis revealed cerebellar GM loss in lobule VI bilaterally in AD and in left Crus I and right Crus II regions in DLB. WM deficits were confined to AD in the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles. DLB demonstrates a different pattern of cerebellar GM loss which, although not significantly different from that in AD, could be an important feature in understanding the neurobiology of DLB and warrants further investigation.

147,147,"Several diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have reported disturbed white matter integrity in various brain regions in patients with schizophrenia, whereas only a few studied the effect of antipsychotics on DTI measures. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of dozapine treatment on DTI findings in patients with schizophrenia, and to compare the findings with those in unaffected controls. The study included 16 patients with schizophrenia who were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, a neurocognitive test battery, and DTI at baseline and 12 weeks after the initiation of clozapine treatment. Eight unaffected controls were assessed once with the neurocognitive test battery and DTI. Voxel-wise analysis of DTI data was performed via tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Compared with the control group, the patient group exhibited lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in 16 brain regions, including the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, superior and inferior parietal lobules, cingulate bundles, cerebellum, middle cerebellar peduncles, and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, whereas the patients had higher FA in six regions, including the right parahippocampus, left anterior thalamic radiation, and right posterior limb of the internal capsule before clozapine treatment. After 12 weeks of treatment with clozapine, white matter FA was increased in widespread brain regions. In two of the regions where FA had initially been lower in patients compared with controls (left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and superior parietal lobule), clozapine appeared to increase FA. An improvement in semantic fluency was correlated with the increase in FA value in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. An increase in FA following 12 weeks of treatment with clozapine suggests that this treatment alters white matter microstructural integrity in patients with schizophrenia previously treated with typical and/or atypical antipsychotics and, in some locations, reverses a previous deficit.

Twelve healthy female subjects underwent both scans and completed the NEO Personality Inventory Revised to assess Impulsiveness (IMP). We examined the relationship between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopaminergic incentive/reward release, measured as a change in D2/D3 binding potential between neutral and incentive/reward conditions with [C-11]raclopride PET, and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation elicited during the anticipation of rewards, measured with fMRI. Left NAcc incentive/reward dopaminergic release correlated with anticipatory reward activation within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left angular gyrus, mammillary bodies, and left superior frontal cortex. Activation in the mPFC negatively correlated with IMP and mediated the relationship between IMP and incentive/reward dopaminergic release in left NAcc.

While the pathogenesis of ALS remains largely unknown, imaging studies of the brain should lead to more insight into structural and functional disease effects on the brain network, which may provide valuable information on the underlying disease process. This study investigates the correlation between changes in structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of the brain network in ALS. Structural reconstructions of the brain network, derived from diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), were obtained from 64 patients and 27 healthy controls. Functional interactions between brain regions were derived from resting-state fMRI. Our results show that (i) the most structurally affected connections considerably overlap with the most functionally impaired connections, (ii) direct connections of the motor cortex are both structurally and functionally more affected than connections at greater topological distance from the motor cortex, and (iii) there is a strong positive correlation between changes in SC and FC averaged per brain region (r=0.44, P<0.0001).

150,150,"The normal myelination of neuronal axons is essential to neurodevelopment, allowing fast inter-neuronal communication. The most dynamic period of myelination occurs in the first few years of life, in concert with a dramatic increase in cognitive abilities. How these processes relate, however, is still unclear. Here we aimed to use a data-driven technique to parcellate developing white matter into regions with consistent white matter growth trajectories and investigate how these regions related to cognitive development. In a large sample of 183 children aged 3 months to 4 years, we calculated whole brain myelin volume fraction (VFM) maps using quantitative multicomponent relaxometry. We used spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to blindly segment these quantitative VFM images into anatomically meaningful parcels with distinct developmental trajectories. We further investigated the relationship of these trajectories with standardized cognitive scores in the same children. The resulting components represented a mix of unilateral and bilateral white matter regions (e.g., cortico-spinal tract, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, white matter underlying the inferior frontal gyrus) as well as structured noise (misregistration, image artifact). The trajectories of these regions were associated with individual differences in cognitive abilities. Specifically, components in white matter underlying frontal and temporal cortices showed significant relationships to expressive and receptive language abilities. Many of these relationships had a significant interaction with age, with VFM becoming more strongly associated with language skills with age. These data provide evidence for a changing coupling between developing myelin and cognitive development. Hum Brain Mapp 35:4475-4487, 2014. (C) 2014 The Authors.

151,151,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders of childhood. Neuroimaging investigations of ADHD have traditionally sought to detect localized abnormalities in discrete brain regions. Recent years, however, have seen the emergence of complementary lines of investigation into distributed connectivity disturbances in ADHD. Current models emphasize abnormal relationships between default network-involved in internally directed mentation and lapses of attention-and task positive networks, especially ventral attention network. However, studies that comprehensively investigate interrelationships between large-scale networks in ADHD remain relatively rare. Methods: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 757 participants at seven sites in the ADHD-200 multisite sample. Functional connectomes were generated for each subject, and interrelationships between seven large-scale brain networks were examined with network contingency analysis. Results: ADHD brains exhibited altered resting state connectivity between default network and ventral attention network [P < 0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected], including prominent increased connectivity (more specifically, diminished anticorrelation) between posterior cingulate cortex in default network and right anterior insula and supplementary motor area in ventral attention network. There was distributed hypoconnectivity within default network (P = 0.009, FDR-corrected), and this network also exhibited significant alterations in its interconnections with several other large-scale networks. Additionally, there was pronounced right lateralization of aberrant default network connections. Conclusions: Consistent with existing theoretical models, these results provide evidence that default network-ventral attention network interconnections are a key locus of dysfunction in ADHD. Moreover, these findings contribute to growing evidence that distributed dysconnectivity within and between large-scale networks is present in ADHD.

We investigated resting state functional connectivity changes in large-scale brain networks and related structural damage underlying cognitive dysfunction in patients with early MS. Patients with relapsing MS (3-5 years disease duration) were prospectively assigned to two groups based on a standardized neuropsychological evaluation: (1) cognitively impaired group (CI group, n = 15), with abnormal performances in at least 3 tests; (2) cognitively preserved group (CP group, n = 20) with normal performances in all tests. Patients and age-matched healthy controls underwent a multimodal 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including anatomical T1 and T2 images, diffusion imaging and resting state functional MRI. Structural MRI analysis revealed that CI patients had a higher white matter lesion load compared to CP and a more severe atrophy in gray matter regions highly connected to networks involved in cognition. Functional connectivity measured by integration was increased in CP patients versus controls in attentional networks (ATT), while integration was decreased in CI patients compared to CP both in the default mode network (DMN) and ATT. An anatomofunctional study within the DMN revealed that functional connectivity was mostly altered between the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in CI patients compared to CP and controls. In a multilinear regression model, functional correlation between MPFC and PCC was best predicted by PCC atrophy.

153,153,"We investigated the contributions of the cerebellum and the motor cortex (M1) to acquisition and retention of human motor memories in a force field reaching task. We found that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum, a technique that is thought to increase neuronal excitability, increased the ability to learn from error and form an internal model of the field, while cathodal cerebellar stimulation reduced this error-dependent learning. In addition, cathodal cerebellar stimulation disrupted the ability to respond to error within a reaching movement reducing the gain of the sensory-motor feedback loop. By contrast, anodal M1 stimulation had no significant effects on these variables. During sham stimulation, early in training the acquired motor memory exhibited rapid decay in error-clamp trials. With further training the rate of decay decreased, suggesting that with training the motor memory was transformed from a labile to a more stable state. Surprisingly, neither cerebellar nor M1 stimulation altered these decay patterns. Participants returned 24 hours later and were re-tested in error-clamp trials without stimulation. The cerebellar group that had learned the task with cathodal stimulation exhibited significantly impaired retention, and retention was not improved by M1 anodal stimulation. In summary, non-invasive cerebellar stimulation resulted in polarity-dependent up- or down-regulation of error-dependent motor learning. In addition, cathodal cerebellar stimulation during acquisition impaired the ability to retain the motor memory overnight. Thus, in the force field task we found a critical role for the cerebellum in both formation of motor memory and its retention.

155,155,"Alpha band activity changes accompanied with the level attentional state, and recent studies suggest that suc' oscillation is associated with activities in the posterior parietal cortex. Here we show that artificially elevating parietal activity via positively-charged electric current through the skull can rapidly and effortlessly change people'prestimulus alpha power and improve subsequent performance on a visual short-term memory (VSTM) task. This modulation of alpha power and behavioral performance, however, is dependent on people's natural VSTIV capability such that only the low performers benefitted from the stimulation, whereas high performers dic not. This behavioral dichotomy is accounted by prestimulus alpha powers around the parieto-occipital regions low performers showed decreased prestimulus alpha power, suggesting improvement in attention deploymen in the current paradigm, whereas the high performers did not benefit from tDCS as they showed equally-low prestimulus alpha power before and after the stimulation. Together, these results suggest that prestimulus alpha power, especially in low performers, can be modulated by anodal stimulation and alter subsequen VSTM performance/capacity. Thus, measuring alpha before stimulus onset may be as important as measuring other VSTM-related electrophysiological components such as attentional allocation and memory capacity relate components (i.e. N2 posterior-contralateral, N2pc, or contralateral delay activity, CDA). In addition, low VST1V performers perhaps do not suffer not only from poor VSTM capacity, but also from broad attentional mechanisms and prestimulus alpha may be an useful tool in understanding the nature of individual differences in VSTM.

156,156,"Despite the practical implication of mild exercise, little is known about its influence on executive function and its neural substrates. To address these issues, the present study examined the effect of an acute bout of mild exercise on executive function and attempted to identify potential neural substrates using non-invasive functional nearinfrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-five young individuals performed a color-word matching Stroop task (CWST) and a two-dimensional scale to measure changes of psychological mood states both before and after 10-minute exercise session on a cycle ergometer at light intensity (30% ((V) over dotO2peak)) and, for the control session, without exercise. Cortical hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal area were monitored with fNIRS during the CWST in both sessions. The acute bout of mild exercise led to improved Stroop performance, which was positively correlated with increased arousal levels. It also evoked cortical activations regarding Stroop interference on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar area. These activations significantly corresponded with both improved cognitive performance and increased arousal levels. Concurrently, this study provides empirica evidence that an acute bout of mild exercise improves executive function mediated by the exercise-induce, arousal system, which intensifies cortical activation in task-related prefrontal sub-regions.

157,157,"Spinal cord segmentation provides measures of atrophy and facilitates group analysis via inter-subject cone spondence. Automatizing this procedure enables studies with large throughput and minimizes user bias. P though several automatic segmentation methods exist, they are often restricted in terms of image contrast am field-of-view. This paper presents a new automatic segmentation method (PropSeg) optimized for robustness, at_ curacy and speed. The algorithm is based on the propagation of a deformable model and is divided into thre parts: firstly, an initialization step detects the spinal cord position and orientation using a circular Hough trans form on multiple axial slices rostral and caudal to the starting plane and builds an initial elliptical tubular mer: Secondly, a low-resolution deformable model is propagated along the spinal cord. To deal with highly variab contrast levels between the spinal cord and the cerebrospinal fluid, the deformation is coupled with a loccontrast-to-noise adaptation at each iteration. Thirdly, a refinement process and a global deformation are applie on the propagated mesh to provide an accurate segmentation of the spinal cord. Validation was performed in healthy subjects and two patients with spinal cord injury, using and T-2-weighted images of the entire spini cord and on multiecho T-2*-weighted images. Our method was compared against manual segmentation am against an active surface method. Results show high precision for all the MR sequences.

158,158,"During adolescence, functional and structural changes in the brain facilitate the transition from childhood to adulthood. Because the cortex and the striatum mature at different rates, temporary imbalances in the frontostriatal network occur. Here, we investigate the development of the subcortical and cortical components of the frontostriatal network from early adolescence to early adulthood in 60 subjects in a cross-sectional design, using functional MRI and a stop-signal task measuring two forms of inhibitory control: reactive inhibition (outright stopping) and proactive inhibition (anticipation of stopping). During development, reactive inhibition improved: older subjects were faster in reactive inhibition. In the brain, this was paralleled by an increase in motor cortex suppression. The level of proactive inhibition increased, with older subjects slowing down responding more than younger subjects when anticipating a stop-signal. Activation increased in the right striatum, right ventral and dorsal inferior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area. Moreover, functional connectivity during proactive inhibition increased between striatum and frontal regions with age. In conclusion, we demonstrate that developmental improvements in proactive inhibition are paralleled by increases in activation and functional connectivity of the frontostriatal network. These data serve as a stepping stone to investigate abnormal development of the frontostriatal network in disorders such as schizophrenia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

159,159,"Brain network topology provides valuable information on healthy and pathological brain functioning. Novel approaches for brain network analysis have shown an association between topological properties and cognitive functioning. Under the assumption that ""stronger is better"", the exploration of brain properties has generally focused on the connectivity patterns of the most strongly correlated regions, whereas the role of weaker brain connections has remained obscure for years. Here, we assessed whether the different strength of connections between brain regions may explain individual differences in intelligence. We analyzed-functional connectivity at rest in ninety-eight healthy individuals of different age, and correlated several connectivity measures with full scale, verbal, and performance Intelligent Quotients (IQs). Our results showed that the variance in IQ levels was mostly explained by the distributed communication efficiency of brain networks built using moderately weak, long-distance connections, with only a smaller contribution of stronger connections. The variability in individual IQs was associated with the global efficiency of a pool of regions in the prefrontal lobes, hippocampus, temporal pole, and postcentral gyrus. These findings challenge the traditional view of a prominent role of strong functional brain connections in brain topology, and highlight the importance of both strong and weak connections in determining the functional architecture responsible for human intelligence variability.

160,160,"Essentially all social species experience social stress which can be a catalyst for detriments in mental and physical health. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) has been shown to produce anxiolytic and antistress effects, thereby qualifying the OXT system as a promising drug target in the treatment of stress-related disorders. However, recently it has been shown that OXT can have anxiogenic effects as well. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brains of 60 healthy men while they were exposed to social stress after they received either intranasal OXT (24 IU) or placebo treatment. Although OXT administration did not alter salivary cortisol levels as a surrogate marker of stress axis activity, our participants initially reported an increment in perceived social stress. This behavioral effect was paralleled on the neural level by increased activity in the precuneus and cingulate cortex. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that OXT can induce a self-referential processing bias which facilitates the sensation of social stress in the absence of altered endocrine responses.

161,161,"In this study, we examined the morphology of the basal ganglia and thalamus in bipolar disorder (BP), schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SCZ-S), and healthy controls (HC) with particular interest in differences related to the absence or presence of psychosis. Volumetric and shape analyses of the basal ganglia and thalamus were performed in 33 BP individuals [12 without history of psychotic features (NPBP) and 21 with history of psychotic features (PBP)], 32 SCZ-S individuals [28 with SCZ and 4 with schizoaffective disorder], and 27 HC using FreeSurfer-initiated large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping. Significant volume differences were found in the caudate and globus pallidus, with volumes smallest in the NPBP group. Shape abnormalities showing inward deformation of superior regions of the caudate were observed in BP (and especially in NPBP) compared with HC. Shape differences were also found in the globus pallidus and putamen when comparing BP and SCZ-S groups. No significant differences were seen in the nucleus accumbens and thalamus. In summary, structural abnormalities in the caudate and globus pallidus are present in BP and SCZ-S. Differences were more apparent in the NPBP subgroup. The findings herein highlight the potential importance of separately examining BP subgroups in neuroimaging studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

164,164,"Growing evidence suggests that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves abnormalities of multiple functional networks. Neuroimaging studies of ASD have therefore increasingly focused on connectivity. Many functional connectivity (fcMRI) studies have reported network underconnectivity in children and adults with ASD. However, there are notable inconsistencies, with some studies reporting overconnectivity. A previous literature survey suggested that a few methodological factors play a crucial role in differential fcMRI outcomes. Using three ASD data sets (two task-related, one resting state) from 54 ASD and 51 typically developing (TD) participants (ages 9-18 years), we examined the impact of four methodological factors: type of pipeline (co-activation vs. intrinsic analysis, related to temporal filtering and removal of task-related effects), seed selection, field of view (whole brain vs. limited ROIs), and dataset. Significant effects were found for type of pipeline, field of view, and dataset. Notably, for each dataset results ranging from robust underconnectivity to robust overconnectivity were detected, depending on the type of pipeline, with intrinsic fcMRI analyses (low bandpass filter and task regressor) predominantly yielding overconnectivity in ASD, but co-activation analyses (no low bandpass filter or task removal) mostly generating underconnectivity findings. These results suggest that methodological variables have dramatic impact on group differences reported in fcMRI studies. Improved awareness of their implications appears indispensible in fcMRI studies when inferences about ""underconnectivity"" or ""overconnectivity"" in ASD are made. In the absence of a gold standard for functional connectivity, the combination of different methodological approaches promises a more comprehensive understanding of connectivity in ASD.

165,165,"Matrix factorization models are the current dominant approach for resolving meaningful data-driven features in neuroimaging data. Among them, independent component analysis (ICA) is arguably the most widely used for identifying functional networks, and its success has led to a number of versatile extensions to group and multi-modal data. However there are indications that ICA may have reached a limit in flexibility and representational capacity, as the majority of such extensions are case-driven, custom-made solutions that are still contained within the class of mixture models. In this work, we seek out a principled and naturally extensible approach and consider a probabilistic model known as a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). An RBM separates linear factors from functional brain imaging data by fitting a probability distribution model to the data. Importantly, the solution can be used as a building block for more complex (deep) models, making it naturally suitable for hierarchical and multimodal extensions that are not easily captured when using linear factorizations alone. We investigate the capability of RBMs to identify intrinsic networks and compare its performance to that of well-known linear mixture models, in particular ICA. Using synthetic and real task fMRI data, we show that RBMs can be used to identify networks and their temporal activations with accuracy that is equal or greater than that of factorization models. The demonstrated effectiveness of RBMs supports its use as a building block for deeper models, a significant prospect for future neuroimaging research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Comparing white matter changes with regional grey matter atrophy (delineated using voxel based morphometry) in the bvFTD cohort revealed co-localisation between modalities particularly in the anterior temporal lobe, however white matter changes extended widely beyond the zones of grey matter atrophy. Our findings demonstrate a distributed signature of white matter alterations that is likely to be core to the pathophysiology of bvFTD and further suggest that this signature is modulated by underlying molecular pathologies.

169,169,"We compared hippocampal volume measures obtained by manual tracing to automatic segmentation with FreeSurfer in 44 younger (20-30 years) and 47 older (60-70 years) adults, each measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over three successive time points, separated by four months. Retest correlations over time were very high for both manual and FreeSurfer segmentations. With FreeSurfer, correlations over time were significantly lower in the older than in the younger age group, which was not the case with manual segmentation. Pearson correlations between manual and FreeSurfer estimates were sufficiently high, numerically even higher in the younger group, whereas intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) estimates were lower in the younger than in the older group. FreeSurfer yielded higher volume estimates than manual segmentation, particularly in the younger age group. Importantly, FreeSurfer consistently overestimated hippocampal volumes independently of manually assessed volume in the younger age group, but overestimated larger volumes in the older age group to a less extent, introducing a systematic age bias in the data. Age differences in hippocampal volumes were significant with FreeSurfer, but not with manual tracing. Manual tracing resulted in a significant difference between left and right hippocampus (right > left), whereas this asymmetry effect was considerably smaller with FreeSurfer estimates. We conclude that FreeSurfer constitutes a feasible method to assess differences in hippocampal volume in young adults. FreeSurfer estimates in older age groups should, however, be interpreted with care until the automatic segmentation pipeline has been further optimized to increase validity and reliability in this age group.

171,171,"Developmental imaging studies show that cortical grey matter decreases in volume during childhood and adolescence. However, considerably less research has addressed the development of subcortical regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, accumbens, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and the cerebellar cortex), in particular not in longitudinal designs. We used the automatic labeling procedure in FreeSurfer to estimate the developmental trajectories of the volume of these subcortical structures in 147 participants (age 7.0-24.3 years old, 94 males; 53 females) of whom 53 participants were scanned twice or more. A total of 223 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (acquired at 1.5-T) were analyzed. Substantial diversity in the developmental trajectories was observed between the different subcortical gray matter structures: the volume of caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens decreased with age, whereas the volume of hippocampus, amygdala, pallidum and cerebellum showed an inverted U-shaped developmental trajectory. The thalamus showed an initial small increase in volume followed by a slight decrease. All structures had a larger volume in males than females over the whole age range, except for the cerebellum that had a sexually dimorphic developmental trajectory. Thus, subcortical structures appear to not yet be fully developed in childhood, similar to the cerebral cortex, and continue to show maturational changes into adolescence. In addition, there is substantial heterogeneity between the developmental trajectories of these structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

172,172,"Brain function relies on the flexible integration of a diverse set of segregated cortical modules, with the structural connectivity of the brain being a fundamentally important factor in shaping the brain's functional dynamics. Following up on macroscopic studies showing the existence of centrally connected nodes in the mammalian brain, combined with the notion that these putative brain hubs may form a dense interconnected 'rich club' collective, we hypothesized that brain connectivity might involve a rich club type of architecture to promote a repertoire of different and flexibly accessible brain functions. With the rich club suggested to play an important role in global brain communication, examining the effects of a rich club organization on the functional repertoire of physical systems in general, and the brain in particular, is of keen interest. Here we elucidate these effects using a spin glass model of neural networks for simulating stable configurations of cortical activity. Using simulations, we show that the presence of a rich club increases the set of attractors and hence the diversity of the functional repertoire over and above the effects produced by scale free type topology alone. Within the networks' overall functional repertoire rich nodes are shown to be important for enabling a high level of dynamic integrations of low-degree nodes to form functional networks. This suggests that the rich club serves as an important backbone for numerous co-activation patterns among peripheral nodes of the network. In addition, applying the spin glass model to empirical anatomical data of the human brain, we show that the positive effects on the functional repertoire attributed to the rich club phenomenon can be observed for the brain as well. We conclude that a rich club organization in network architectures may be crucial for the facilitation and integration of a diverse number of segregated functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

175,175,"Neurofibrillary tangles are associated with cognitive dysfunction, and hippocampal atrophy with increased CSF tau markers. However, the plasma tau levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been well studied. We investigated plasma tau by using an immunomagnetic reduction assay in 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, 10 early AD dementia, and 30 healthy elders (HE). All received a 3D-brain MRI scan and a set of cognitive function test. We explored their relationships with both brain structure and cognitive functions. Images were analyzed to determine the brain volumes and gray matter densities. Patients with MCI or early AD had significantly increased plasma tau levels compared with HE. Plasma tau levels were negatively associated with the performance of logical memory, visual reproduction, and verbal fluency; also negatively associated with volume of total gray matter, hippocampus, amygdala; and gray matter densities of various regions. Regression analyses indicated that logical memory explained 0.394 and hippocampus volume predicted .608 of the variance of plasma tau levels, both P < 0.001. Education years were negatively associated with the gray matter densities of the supramarginal (r = -0.407), middle temporal gyrus (r = -0.40) and precuneus (r = -0.377; all P < 0.05) in HE; and negatively associated with plasma tau levels in patients (r = -0.626).

176,176,"Background Bipolar disorder and Major depressive disorder are difficult to differentiate during depressive episodes, motivating research for differentiating neurobiological markers. Dysfunctional amygdala responsiveness during emotion processing has been implicated in both disorders, but the important rapid and automatic stages of emotion processing in the amygdala have so far never been investigated in bipolar patients. Methods fMRI data of 22 bipolar depressed patients (BD), 22 matched unipolar depressed patients (MDD), and 22 healthy controls (HC) were obtained during processing of subliminal sad, happy and neutral faces. Amygdala responsiveness was investigated using standard univariate analyses as well as pattern-recognition techniques to differentiate the two clinical groups. Furthermore, medication effects on amygdala responsiveness were explored. Results All subjects were unaware of the emotional faces. Univariate analysis revealed a significant group x emotion interaction within the left amygdala. Amygdala responsiveness to sad>neutral faces was increased in MDD relative to BD. In contrast, responsiveness to happy>neutral faces showed the opposite pattern, with higher amygdala activity in BD than in MDD. Most of the activation patterns in both clinical groups differed significantly from activation patterns of HCand therefore represent abnormalities. Furthermore, pattern classification on amygdala activation to sad>happy faces yielded almost 80% accuracy differentiating MDD and BD patients. Medication had no significant effect on these findings. Conclusions Distinct amygdala excitability during automatic stages of the processing of emotional faces may reflect differential pathophysiological processes in BD versus MDD depression, potentially representing diagnosis-specific neural markers mostly unaffected by current psychotropic medication.

We hypothesized that both the structural and functional organization of the SN and functional interactions between the SN and CEN/DMN are altered in normal aging and in AD/aMCI. Gray matter volume (GMV) and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) were analyzed from healthy younger (HYC) to older controls (HOC) and from HOC to aMCI and AD patients. All the SN components showed significant differences in the GMV, intranetwork FC, and internetwork FC between the HYC and HOC. Most of the SN components showed differences in the GMV between the HOC and AD and between the aMCI and AD. Compared with the HOC, AD patients exhibited significant differences in intra- and internetwork FCs of the SN, whereas aMCI patients demonstrated differences in internetwork FC of the SN. Most of the GMVs and internetwork FCs of the SN and part of the intranetwork FC of the SN were correlated with cognitive differences in older subjects. Our findings suggested that structural and functional impairments of the SN may occur as early as in normal aging and that functional disconnection between the SN and CEN/ DMN may also be associated with both normal aging and disease progression.

178,178,"Successful social interactions rely upon the abilities of two or more people to mutually exchange information in real-time, while simultaneously adapting to one another. The neural basis of social cognition has mostly been investigated in isolated individuals, and more recently using two-person paradigms to quantify the neuronal dynamics underlying social interaction. While several studies have shown the relevance of understanding complementary and mutually adaptive processes, the neural mechanisms underlying such coordinative behavioral patterns during joint action remain largely unknown. Here, we employed a synchronized finger-tapping task while measuring dual-EEG from pairs of human participants who either mutually adjusted to each other in an interactive task or followed a computer metronome. Neurophysiologically, the interactive condition was characterized by a stronger suppression of alpha and low-beta oscillations over motor and frontal areas in contrast to the non-interactive computer condition. A multivariate analysis of two-brain activity to classify interactive versus non-interactive trials revealed asymmetric patterns of the frontal alpha-suppression in each pair, during both task anticipation and execution, such that only one member showed the frontal component. Analysis of the behavioral data showed that this distinction coincided with the leader-follower relationship in 8/9 pairs, with the leaders characterized by the stronger frontal alpha-suppression. This suggests that leaders invest more resources in prospective planning and control. Hence our results show that the spontaneous emergence of leader-follower relationships in dyadic interactions can be predicted from EEG recordings of brain activity prior to and during interaction. Furthermore, this emphasizes the importance of investigating complementarity in joint action. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

179,179,"Unambiguous interpretation of changes in the BOLD signal is challenging because of the complex neurovascular coupling that translates changes in neuronal activity into the subsequent haemodynamic response. In particular, the neurophysiological origin of the negative BOLD response (NBR) remains incompletely understood. Here, we simultaneously recorded BOLD, EEG and cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to 10 s blocks of unilateral median nerve stimulation (MNS) in order to interrogate the NBR. Both negative BOLD and negative CBF responses to MNS were observed in the same region of the ipsilateral primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) and calculations showed that MNS induced a decrease in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in this NBR region. The Delta CMRO2/Delta CBF coupling ratio (n) was found to be significantly larger in this ipsilateral S1/M1 region (n = 0.91 +/- 0.04, M = 10.45%) than in the contralateral S1/M1 (n = 0.65 +/- 0.03, M = 10.45%) region that exhibited a positive BOLD response (PBR) and positive CBF response, and a consequent increase in CMRO2 during MNS. The fMRI response amplitude in ipsilateral S1/M1 was negatively correlated with both the power of the 8-13 Hz EEG mu oscillation and somatosensory evoked potential amplitude. Blocks in which the largest magnitude of negative BOLD and CBF responses occurred therefore showed greatest mu power, an electrophysiological index of cortical inhibition, and largest somatosensory evoked potentials. Taken together, our results suggest that a neuronal mechanism underlies the NBR, but that the NBR may originate from a different neurovascular coupling mechanism to the PBR, suggesting that caution should be taken in assuming the NBR simply represents the neurophysiological inverse of the PBR.

181,181,"Impulsivity and aggressiveness are personality traits associated with a vulnerability to suicidal behavior. Behavioral expression of these traits differs by gender and has been related to central serotonergic function. We assessed the relationships between serotonin-2A receptor function, gender, and personality traits in borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder characterized by impulsive-aggression and recurrent suicidal behavior. Participants, who included 33 BPD patients and 27 healthy controls (HC), were assessed for Axis I and II disorders with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the International Personality Disorders Examination, and with the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients-Revised for BPD. Depressed mood, impulsivity, aggression, and temperament were assessed with standardized measures. Positron emission tomography with [F-18]altanserin as ligand and arterial blood sampling was used to determine the binding potentials (BPND) of serotonin-2A receptors in 11 regions of interest Data were analyzed using Logan graphical analysis, controlling for age and nonspecific binding. Among BPD subjects, aggression, Cluster B co-morbidity, antisocial PD, and childhood abuse were each related to altanserin binding. BPND values predicted impulsivity and aggression in BPD females (but not BPD males), and in HC males (but not HC females.) Altanserin binding was greater in BPD females than males in every contrast, but it did not discriminate suicide attempters from non-attempters. Region specific differences in serotonin-2A receptor binding related to diagnosis and gender predicted clinical expression of aggression and impulsivity.

182,182,"Impulsivity and aggressiveness are trait dispositions associated with the vulnerability to suicidal behavior across diagnoses. They are associated with structural and functional abnormalities in brain networks involved in regulation of mood, impulse and behavior. They are also core characteristics of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder defined, in part, by recurrent suicidal behavior. We assessed the relationships between personality traits, brain structure and lethality of suicide attempts in 51 BPD attempters using multiple regression analyses on structural MRI data. BPD was diagnosed by the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients-revised, impulsivity by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), aggression by the Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression (LHA), and high lethality by a score of 4 or more on the Lethality Rating Scale (LRS). Sixteen High Lethality attempters were compared to 35 Low Lethality attempters, with no significant differences noted in gender, co-morbidity, childhood abuse, BIS or LHA scores. Degree of medical lethality (LRS) was negatively related to gray matter volumes across multiple fronto-temporal-limbic regions. Effects of impulsivity and aggression on gray matter volumes discriminated High from Low Lethality attempters and differed markedly within lethality groups.

183,183,"Improvements in the spatial resolution of structural and functional MRI are beginning to enable analysis of intracortical structures such as heavily myelinated layers in 3D, a prerequisite for in-vivo parcellation of individual human brains. This parcellation can only be performed precisely if the profiles used in cortical analysis are anatomically meaningful. Profiles are often constructed as traverses that are perpendicular to computed laminae. In this case they are fully determined by these laminae. The aim of this study is to evaluate models for cortical laminae used so far and to establish a new model. Methods to model the laminae used so far include constructing laminae that keep a constant distance to the cortical boundaries, so-called equidistant laminae. Another way is to compute equipotentials between the cortical boundary surfaces with the Laplace equation. The Laplace profiles resulting from the gradients to the equipotentials were often-used because of their nice mathematical properties. However, the equipotentials These Laplacian profiles are constructed from and the equidistant laminae do not follow the anatomical layers observed using high resolution MRI of cadaver brain. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel equi-volume model that derives from work by Bok (1929). He argued that cortical segments preserve their volume, while layer thickness changes to compensate cortical folding. We incorporate this preservation of volume in our new equi-volume model to generate a three-dimensional well-adapted undistorted coordinate system of the cortex. When defined by this well-adapted coordinate system, cortical depth is anatomically meaningful. We compare isocontours from these cortical depth values to locations of myelinated bands on high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo three-dimensional MR images. A similar comparison was performed with equipotentials computed with the Laplace equation and with equidistant isocontours. A quantitative evaluation of the equi-volume model using measured image intensities confirms that it provides a much better fit to observed cortical layering. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

184,184,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) we investigated the functional integrity of resting-state networks (RSN) in HD. 17 HD and 19 matched control participants were examined at a 3 Tesla MR scanner. After controlling for structural degeneration by means of voxel-based morphometry, task-free rs-fMRI data were analyzed using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a dual-regression approach in the context of genetic and clinical parameters. Further, we evaluated HD-related differences in interregional connectivity between networks. RSN analysis showed a significant increase in intrinsic functional connectivity in the HD sample compared with controls, including the thalamus, striatum, prefrontal, premotor, and parietal maps. A subset of the Default Mode Network (DMN) was also affected. In the HD cohort, motor impairment correlated with higher network connectivity in mainly motor and parietal cortices. Deteriorating total functional capacity was additionally associated with higher connectivity in the striatum, thalamus, insular and frontal areas. This pattern of increased activity in intrinsic functional networks might suggest a reduced ability of intra-network differentiation with clinical disease progression in HD. Finally, results showed reduced long-range connectivity between parietal ICA components in HD compared to controls, indicating impaired functional coupling between interregional networks in HD. Our data demonstrates that functional connectivity is profoundly altered in HD, both within and between RSN.

184,184,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) we investigated the functional integrity of resting-state networks (RSN) in HD. 17 HD and 19 matched control participants were examined at a 3 Tesla MR scanner. After controlling for structural degeneration by means of voxel-based morphometry, task-free rs-fMRI data were analyzed using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a dual-regression approach in the context of genetic and clinical parameters. Further, we evaluated HD-related differences in interregional connectivity between networks.

185,185,"Automatic and reliable segmentation of subcortical structures is an important but difficult task in quantitative brain image analysis. Multi-atlas based segmentation methods have attracted great interest due to their promising performance. Under the multi-atlas based segmentation framework, using deformation fields generated for registering atlas images onto a target image to be segmented, labels of the atlases are first propagated to the target image space and then fused to get the target image segmentation based on a label fusion strategy. While many label fusion strategies have been developed, most of these methods adopt predefined weighting models that are not necessarily optimal. In this study, we propose a novel local label learning strategy to estimate the target image's segmentation label using statistical machine learning techniques. In particular, we use a L1-regularized support vector machine (SVM) with a k nearest neighbor (kNN) based training sample selection strategy to learn a classifier for each of the target image voxel from its neighboring voxels in the atlases based on both image intensity and texture features. Our method has produced segmentation results consistently better than state-of-the-art label fusion methods in validation experiments on hippocampal segmentation of over 100 MR images obtained from publicly available and in-house datasets. Volumetric analysis has also demonstrated the capability of our method in detecting hippocampal volume changes due to Alzheimer's disease. Hum Brain Mapp 35:2674-2697, 2014.

Recent neuroimaging data suggest that the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) has a key role for cognitive aspects of movement generation, i.e., intentional motor control. We here tested the functional connectivity of this area using two complementary approaches: (1) resting-state connectivity of the aMCC based on fMRI scans obtained in 100 subjects, and (2) functional connectivity in the context of explicit task conditions using meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) over 656 imaging experiment. Both approaches revealed a convergent functional network architecture of the aMCC with prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices as well as anterior insula, area 44/45, cerebellum and dorsal striatum. To specifically test the role of the aMCC's task-based functional connectivity in cognitive motor control, separate MACM analyses were conducted over cognitive and action related experimental paradigms. Both analyses confirmed the same task-based connectivity pattern of the aMCC. While the cognition domain showed higher convergence of activity in supramodal association areas in prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, action related experiments yielded higher convergence in somatosensory and premotor areas. Secondly, to probe the functional specificity of the aMCC's convergent functional connectivity, it was compared with a neural network of intentional movement initiation. This exemplary comparison confirmed the involvement of the state independent FC network of the aMCC in the intentional generation of movements.

Exploration of brain-phenotype relationships remains limited by statistical approaches that are computationally intensive, depend on a priori hypotheses, or require stringent correction for multiple comparisons.

Using resting state fMRI data, we demonstrate the utility of our analytic framework by identifying significant connectivity-phenotype relationships for full-scale IQ and assessing their overlap with existent neuroimaging findings, as synthesized by openly available automated meta-analysis (www.neurosynth.org). The results appeared to be robust to the removal of nuisance covariates (i.e., mean connectivity, global signal, and motion) and varying brain resolution (i.e., voxelwise results are highly similar to results using 800 parcellations). We show that CWAS findings can be used to guide subsequent seed-based correlation analyses. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach by examining CWAS for three additional datasets, each encompassing a distinct phenotypic variable: neurotypical development, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder diagnostic status, and L-DOPA pharmacological manipulation. For each phenotype, our approach to CWAS identified distinct connectome-wide association profiles, not previously attainable in a single study utilizing traditional univariate approaches.

190,190,"Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is the change in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a change in a vasoactive stimulus. Paradoxical reductions in CBF in response to vasodilatory stimulation ('steal') are associated with vascular pathology. However, a pathophysiological interpretation of 'steal' requires a comprehensive conceptual model linking pathology and changes in blood flow. Herein, we extend a simple model explaining steal published in the late 1960s by incorporating concepts of CBF regulation from more recent studies to generate a comprehensive dynamic model. The main elements of the model are: (a) the relationship between changes in CBF and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in healthy vascular regions is sigmoidal; (b) vascular regions vasodilate to compensate for decreased perfusion pressure, leading to (c) an encroachment on vasodilatory reserve and, reduced CVR; (d) a vasodilatory stimulus may increase CBF capacity above the flow capacity of major cerebral blood vessels; and (e) this limitation induces competitive intra-cerebral redistribution of flow from territories with low vasodilatory reserve to those with high reserve. We used CVR measurements generated by applying precise, computer-controlled changes in PaCO2 as the vasoactive stimulus, and measured blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI signals as high resolution surrogates of CBF to test predictions derived from this model. Subjects were 16 healthy adults and 16 patients with known cerebral steno-occlusive diseases. We observed regional sigmoidal PaCO2-BOLD response curves with a range of slopes; graded changes in PaCO2 resulted in redistributions of BOLD signal consistent with the known underlying vascular pathology and predictions of the model. We conclude that this model can be applied to provide a hemodynamic interpretation to BOLD signal changes in response to hypercapnia, and thereby aid in relating CVR maps to pathophysiological conditions.

191,191,"Background: To measure hippocampal volume change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), expert manual delineation is often used because of its supposed accuracy. It has been suggested that expert outlining yields poorer reproducibility as compared to automated methods, but this has not been investigated. Aim: To determine the reproducibilities of expert manual outlining and two common automated methods for measuring hippocampal atrophy rates in healthy aging, MCI and AD. Methods: From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 80 subjects were selected:20 patients with AD, 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Left and right hippocampal volume change between baseline and month-12 visit was assessed by using expert manual delineation, and by the automated software packages FreeSurfer (longitudinal processing stream) and FIRST. To assess reproducibility of the measured hippocampal volume change, both back-to-back (BTB) MPRAGE scans available for each visit were analyzed. Hippocampal volume change was expressed in mu L, and as a percentage of baseline volume. Reproducibility of the 1-year hippocampal volume change was estimated from the BTB measurements by using linear mixed model to calculate the limits of agreement (LoA) of each method, reflecting its measurement uncertainty. Using the delta method, approximate p-values were calculated for the pairwise comparisons between methods. Statistical analyses were performed both with inclusion and exclusion of visibly incorrect segmentations. Results: Visibly incorrect automated segmentation in either one or both scans of a longitudinal scan pair occurred in 7.5% of the hippocampi for FreeSurfer and in 6.9% of the hippocampi for FIRST. After excluding these failed cases, reproducibility analysis for 1-year percentage volume change yielded LoA of +/- 7.2% for FreeSurfer, +/- 9.7% for expert manual delineation, and +/- 10.0% for FIRST. Methods ranked the same for reproducibility of 1-year mu 1. volume change, with LoA of +/- 218 mu L for FreeSurfer, +/- 319 mu L for expert manual delineation, and 333 mu L for FIRST. Approximate p-values indicated that reproducibility was better for FreeSurfer than for manual or FIRST, and that manual and FIRST did not differ. Inclusion of failed automated segmentations led to worsening of reproducibility of both automated methods for 1-year raw and percentage volume change. Conclusion: Quantitative reproducibility values of 1-year microliter and percentage hippocampal volume change were roughly similar between expert manual outlining, FIRST and FreeSurfer, but FreeSurfer reproducibility was statistically significantly superior to both manual outlining and FIRST after exclusion of failed segmentations.

192,192,"Time perception is a critical component of conscious experience. To be in synchrony with the environment, the brain must deal not only with differences in the speed of light and sound but also with its computational and neural transmission delays. Here, we asked whether the brain could actively compensate for temporal delays by changing its processing time. Specifically, can changes in neural timing or in the phase of neural oscillation index perceived timing? For this, a lag-adaptation paradigm was used to manipulate participants' perceived audiovisual (AV) simultaneity of events while they were recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Desynchronized AV stimuli were presented rhythmically to elicit a robust 1 Hz frequency-tagging of auditory and visual cortical responses. As participants' perception of AV simultaneity shifted, systematic changes in the phase of entrained neural oscillations were observed. This suggests that neural entrainment is not a passive response and that the entrained neural oscillation shifts in time. Crucially, our results indicate that shifts in neural timing in auditory cortices linearly map participants' perceived AV simultaneity. To our knowledge, these results provide the first mechanistic evidence for active neural compensation in the encoding of sensory event timing in support of the emergence of time awareness.

193,193,"Anxiety and addiction disorders are two of the most common mental disorders in the United States, and are typically chronic, disabling, and comorbid. Emerging evidence suggests the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediates both anxiety and addiction through connections with other brain regions, including the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Although BNST structural connections have been identified in rodents and a limited number of structural connections have been verified in non-human primates, BNST connections have yet to be described in humans. Neuroimaging is a powerful tool for identifying structural and functional circuits in vivo. In this study, we examined BNST structural and functional connectivity in a large sample of humans. The BNST showed structural and functional connections with multiple subcortical regions, including limbic, thalamic, and basal ganglia structures, confirming structural findings in rodents. We describe two novel connections in the human brain that have not been previously reported in rodents or non-human primates, including a structural connection with the temporal pole, and a functional connection with the paracingulate gyrus. The findings of this study provide a map of the BNST's structural and functional connectivity across the brain in healthy humans. In large part, the BNST neurocircuitry in humans is similar to the findings from rodents and non-human primates; however, several connections are unique to humans. Future explorations of BNST neurocircuitry in anxiety and addiction disorders have the potential to reveal novel mechanisms underlying these disabling psychiatric illnesses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

194,194,"Recent imaging studies have demonstrated functional brain network changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Eigenvector centrality (EC) is a graph analytical measure that identifies prominent regions in the brain network hierarchy and detects localized differences between patient populations. This study used voxel-wise EC mapping (ECM) to analyze individual whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in 39 AD patients (age 67 +/- 8) and 43 healthy controls (age 69 +/- 7). Between-group differences were assessed by a permutation-based method. Associations of EC with biomarkers for AD pathology in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were assessed using Spearman correlation analysis. Decreased EC was found bilaterally in the occipital cortex in AD patients compared to controls. Regions of increased EC were identified in the anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyrus. Across groups, frontal and occipital EC changes were associated with pathological concentrations of CSF biomarkers and with cognition. In controls, decreased EC values in the occipital regions were related to lower MMSE scores. Our main finding is that ECM, a hypothesis-free and computationally efficient analysis method of functional MRI (fMRI) data, identifies changes in brain network organization in AD patients that are related to cognition and underlying AD pathology. The relation between AD-like EC changes and cognitive performance suggests that resting-state fMRI measured EC is a potential marker of disease severity for AD. Hum Brain Mapp 35:2383-2393, 2014.

Eigenvector centrality (EC) is a graph analytical measure that identifies prominent regions in the brain network hierarchy and detects localized differences between patient populations. This study used voxel-wise EC mapping (ECM) to analyze individual whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in 39 AD patients (age 67 +/- 8) and 43 healthy controls (age 69 +/- 7). Between-group differences were assessed by a permutation-based method. Associations of EC with biomarkers for AD pathology in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were assessed using Spearman correlation analysis. Decreased EC was found bilaterally in the occipital cortex in AD patients compared to controls. Regions of increased EC were identified in the anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyrus. Across groups, frontal and occipital EC changes were associated with pathological concentrations of CSF biomarkers and with cognition. In controls, decreased EC values in the occipital regions were related to lower MMSE scores. Our main finding is that ECM, a hypothesis-free and computationally efficient analysis method of functional MRI (fMRI) data, identifies changes in brain network organization in AD patients that are related to cognition and underlying AD pathology. The relation between AD-like EC changes and cognitive performance suggests that resting-state fMRI measured EC is a potential marker of disease severity for AD. Hum Brain Mapp 35:2383-2393, 2014.

195,195,"Visual misperceptions and hallucinations represent a problematic symptom of Parkinson's disease. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain poorly understood, however, a recent hypothesis has suggested that visual misperceptions and hallucinations may arise from disrupted processing across attentional networks. To test the specific predictions of this hypothesis, 22 patients with Parkinson's disease underwent 3T fMRI while performing the Bistable Percept Paradigm, a task that has previously been shown to identify patients with hallucinations. Subjects are required to study a battery of randomly assigned ""monostable"" and ""bistable"" monochromatic images for the presence or absence of a bistable percept. Those patients who scored a high percentage of misperceptions and missed images on the task were less able to activate frontal and parietal hubs of the putative Dorsal Attention Network. Furthermore, poor performance on the task was significantly correlated with the degree of decreased activation in a number of these hubs. At the group level, the difference between processing a bistable versus a monostable cue was associated with increased recruitment of the anterior insula. In addition, those patients with impaired performance on the paradigm displayed decreased resting state functional connectivity between hubs of the Ventral and Dorsal Attention Networks. These same patients had significantly decreased gray matter in the insula bilaterally. In addition, a combined analysis of the separate neuroimaging approaches revealed significant relationships across the impaired networks. These findings are consistent with specific predictions from a recently proposed hypothesis that implicates dysfunction within attentional networks in Parkinsonian hallucinations.

196,196,"Adolescence is a transitional period between childhood and adulthood and is characterized by emotional instability. Underlying this behavior may be an imbalance between the limbic subcortical areas and the prefrontal cortex. Here, we investigated differences in these regions during adolescence and young adulthood. Fifty subjects aged 10 to 24 viewed and rated neutral, negative, and positive pictures (IAPS: International Affective Picture System), while being scanned with functional MRI. Only those trials in which there was a match between the subject's response and the IAPS rating were included in the analyses. Task performance (matching accuracy, reaction times) did not differ across age. Activity in the amygdala and hippocampus decreased with age when processing emotional salient stimuli versus neutral stimuli. In contrast, activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex increased with age. Importantly, we show for the first time that these age-related changes are paralleled by an increase in functional coupling of the amygdala and hippocampus with the orbitofrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings are in line with the general notion that brain development from childhood to adulthood is characterized by a gradual increase in frontal control over subcortical regions. Understanding these developmental changes is important as these may underlie typical adolescent behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Within this PLS model, greater skill acquisition was predicted by higher connectivity between M1 and left parietal cortex, possibly reflecting greater capacity for visuomotor integration, and by lower connectivity between M1 and left frontal-premotor areas, possibly reflecting differences in motor planning strategies.

198,198,"Brain diffusion templates contain rich information about the microstructure of the brain, and are used as references in spatial normalization or in the development of brain atlases. The accuracy of diffusion templates constructed based on the diffusion tensor (DT) model is limited in regions with complex neuronal micro-architecture. High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) overcomes limitations of the DT model and is capable of resolving intravoxel heterogeneity. However, when HARDI is combined with multiple-shot sequences to minimize image artifacts, the scan time becomes inappropriate for human brain imaging. In this work, an artifact-free HARDI template of the human brain was developed from low angular resolution multiple-shot diffusion data. The resulting HARDI template was produced in ICBM-152 space based on Turboprop diffusion data, was shown to resolve complex neuronal micro-architecture in regions with intravoxel heterogeneity, and contained fiber orientation information consistent with known human brain anatomy.

199,199,"The topic of functional connectivity in neuroimaging is expanding rapidly and many studies now focus on coupling between spatially separate brain regions. These studies show that a relatively small number of large scale networks exist within the brain, and that healthy function of these networks is disrupted in many clinical populations. To date, the vast majority of studies probing connectivity employ techniques that compute time averaged correlation over several minutes, and between specific pre-defined brain locations. However, increasing evidence suggests that functional connectivity is non-stationary in time. Further, electrophysiological measurements show that connectivity is dependent on the frequency band of neural oscillations. It is also conceivable that networks exhibit a degree of spatial inhomogeneity, i.e. the large scale networks that we observe may result from the time average of multiple transiently synchronised sub-networks, each with their own spatial signature. This means that the next generation of neuroimaging tools to compute functional connectivity must account for spatial inhomogeneity, spectral non-uniformity and temporal non-stationarity. Here, we present a means to achieve this via application of windowed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to source space projected MEG data. We describe the generation of time-frequency connectivity plots, showing the temporal and spectral distribution of coupling between brain regions. Moreover, CCA over voxels provides a means to assess spatial non-uniformity within short time-frequency windows.

200,200,"A growing number of studies suggest the brain's ""default network"" becomes engaged when individuals recall their personal past or simulate their future. Recent reports of heterogeneity within the network raise the possibility that these autobiographical processes comprised of multiple component processes, each supported by distinct functional-anatomic subsystems. We previously hypothesized that a medial temporal subsystem contributes to autobiographical memory and future thought by enabling individuals to retrieve prior information and bind this information into a mental scene. Conversely, a dorsal medial subsystem was proposed to support social-reflective aspects of autobiographical thought, allowing individuals to reflect on the mental states of one's self and others (i.e. ""mentalizing""). To test these hypotheses, we first examined activity in the default network subsystems as participants performed two commonly employed tasks of episodic retrieval and mentalizing. In a subset of participants, relationships among task-evoked regions were examined at rest, in the absence of an overt task. Finally, large-scale fMRI meta-analyses were conducted to identify brain regions that most strongly predicted the presence of episodic retrieval and mentalizing, and these results were compared to meta-analyses of autobiographical tasks. Across studies, laboratory-based episodic retrieval tasks were preferentially linked to the medial temporal subsystem, while mentalizing tasks were preferentially linked to the dorsal medial subsystem. In turn, autobiographical tasks engaged aspects of both subsystems. These results suggest the default network is a heterogeneous brain system whose subsystems support distinct component processes of autobiographical thought. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

201,201,"Although diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have reported fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormalities in multiple white matter (WM) regions in schizophrenia, relationship between abnormal FA and negative symptoms has not been fully explored. DTI data were acquired from twenty-four patients with chronic schizophrenia and twenty-five healthy controls. Regional brain abnormalities were evaluated by conducting FA comparisons in the cerebral and each lobar WMs between groups. Focal abnormalities were also evaluated with a voxel-wise tract specific method. Associations between structural WM changes and negative symptoms were assessed using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). The patient group showed decreased FA in the cerebrum, especially in the frontal lobe, compared with controls. A voxel-wise analysis showed FA decreases in almost all WM tracts in schizophrenia. Correlation analyses demonstrated negative relationships between FA in the cerebrum, particularly in the left hemisphere, and SANS global and global rating scores (Anhedonia-Asociality, Attention, and Affective-Flattening), and also associations between FA of left frontal lobe and SANS global score, Anhedonia-Asociality, and Attention.

In this experiment, we investigated whether and to what extent resting state functional connectivity is modulated by sex hormones in women, both across the menstrual cycle and when altered by oral contraceptive pills. Sex hormones have been shown to have important effects on task-related activity, but few studies have investigated the extent to which they can influence the behavior of functional networks at rest These hormones are dramatically altered by the use of hormonal contraception, which is used by approximately 100 million women worldwide. However, potential cognitive side effects of hormonal contraception have been given little attention. Here, we collected resting state data for naturally-cycling women (n = 45) and women using combined oral contraceptive pills (n = 46) and evaluated the differences in resting state activity between these two groups using independent component analysis. We found that in the default mode network and in a network associated with executive control, resting state dynamics were altered both by the menstrual cycle and by oral contraceptive use. Specifically, the connectivity of the left angular gyrus, the left middle frontal gyms, and the anterior cingulate cortex were different between groups. Because the anterior cingulate cortex and left middle frontal gyms are important for higher-order cognitive and emotional processing, including conflict monitoring, changes in the relationship of these structures to the functional networks with which they interact may have important consequences for attention, affect, and/or emotion regulation.

204,204,"Neuroscience research has thoroughly studied how nonliteral language is processed during metaphor comprehension. However, it is not clear how the brain actually creates nonliteral language. Therefore, the present study for the first time investigates the neural correlates of metaphor production. Participants completed sentences by generating novel metaphors or literal synonyms during functional imaging. Responses were spoken aloud in the scanner, recorded, and subsequently rated for their creative quality. We found that metaphor production was associated with focal activity in predominantly left-hemispheric brain regions, specifically the left angular gyrus, the left middle and superior frontal gyri-corresponding to the left dorsomedial prefrontal (DMPFC) cortex-and the posterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, brain activation in the left anterior DMPFC and the right middle temporal gyrus was found to linearly increase with the creative quality of metaphor responses. These findings are related to neuroscientific evidence on metaphor comprehension, creative idea generation and episodic future thought, suggesting that creating metaphors involves the flexible adaptation of semantic memory to imagine and construct novel figures of speech. Furthermore, the left DMPFC may exert executive control to maintain strategic search and selection, thus facilitating creativity of thought. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

205,205,"Recent work on both task-induced and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data suggests that functional connectivity may fluctuate, rather than being stationary during an entire scan. Most dynamic studies are based on second-order statistics between fMRI time series or time courses derived from blind source separation, e.g., independent component analysis (ICA), to investigate changes of temporal interactions among brain regions. However, fluctuations related to spatial components over time are of interest as well. In this paper, we examine higher-order statistical dependence between pairs of spatial components, which we define as spatial functional network connectivity (sFNC), and changes of sFNC across a resting-state scan. We extract time-varying components from healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia to represent brain networks using independent vector analysis (IVA), which is an extension of ICA to multiple data sets and enables one to capture spatial variations. Based on mutual information among IVA components, we perform statistical analysis and Markov modeling to quantify the changes in spatial connectivity. Our experimental results suggest significantly more fluctuations in patient group and show that patients with schizophrenia have more variable patterns of spatial concordance primarily between the frontoparietal, cerebellar and temporal lobe regions.

206,206,"The relationship between anatomic connectivity of large-scale brain networks and their functional connectivity is of immense importance and an area of active research. Previous attempts have required complex simulations which model the dynamics of each cortical region, and explore the coupling between regions as derived by anatomic connections. While much insight is gained from these non-linear simulations, they can be computationally taxing tools for predicting functional from anatomic connectivities. Little attention has been paid to linear models. Here we show that a properly designed linear model appears to be superior to previous non-linear approaches in capturing the brain's long-range second order correlation structure that governs the relationship between anatomic and functional connectivities. We derive a linear network of brain dynamics based on graph diffusion, whereby the diffusing quantity undergoes a random walk on a graph. We test our model using subjects who underwent diffusion MRI and resting state fMRI. The network diffusion model applied to the structural networks largely predicts the correlation structures derived from their fMRI data, to a greater extent than other approaches. The utility of the proposed approach is that it can routinely be used to infer functional correlation from anatomic connectivity. And since it is linear, anatomic connectivity can also be inferred from functional data. The success of our model confirms the linearity of ensemble average signals in the brain, and implies that their long-range correlation structure may percolate within the brain via purely mechanistic processes enacted on its structural connectivity pathways.

Previous attempts have required complex simulations which model the dynamics of each cortical region, and explore the coupling between regions as derived by anatomic connections. While much insight is gained from these non-linear simulations, they can be computationally taxing tools for predicting functional from anatomic connectivities. Little attention has been paid to linear models. Here we show that a properly designed linear model appears to be superior to previous non-linear approaches in capturing the brain's long-range second order correlation structure that governs the relationship between anatomic and functional connectivities. We derive a linear network of brain dynamics based on graph diffusion, whereby the diffusing quantity undergoes a random walk on a graph. We test our model using subjects who underwent diffusion MRI and resting state fMRI. The network diffusion model applied to the structural networks largely predicts the correlation structures derived from their fMRI data, to a greater extent than other approaches. The utility of the proposed approach is that it can routinely be used to infer functional correlation from anatomic connectivity. And since it is linear, anatomic connectivity can also be inferred from functional data. The success of our model confirms the linearity of ensemble average signals in the brain, and implies that their long-range correlation structure may percolate within the brain via purely mechanistic processes enacted on its structural connectivity pathways.

207,207,"Spontaneous (or resting-state) brain activity has attracted a growing body of neuroimaging research over the last decades. Whole-brain network models have proved helpful to investigate the source of slow (<0.1 Hz) correlated hemodynamic fluctuations revealed in fMRI during rest. However, the mechanisms mediating resting-state long-distance correlations and the relationship with the faster neural activity remain unclear. Novel insights coming from MEG studies have shown that the amplitude envelopes of alpha- and beta-frequency oscillations (-8-30 Hz) display similar correlation patterns as the fMRI signals. In this work, we combine experimental and theoretical work to investigate the mechanisms of spontaneous MEG functional connectivity. Using a simple model of coupled oscillators adapted to incorporate realistic whole-brain connectivity and conduction delays, we explore how slow and structured amplitude envelopes of band-pass filtered signals - fairly reproducing MEG data collected from 10 healthy subjects at rest - are generated spontaneously in the space-time structure of the brain network Our simulation results show that the large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity provides an optimal network structure to support a regime with metastable synchronization. In this regime, different subsystems may temporarily synchronize at reduced collective frequencies (falling in the 8-30 Hz range due to the delays) while the global system never fully synchronizes. This mechanism modulates the frequency of the oscillators on a slow time-scale (<0.1 Hz) leading to structured amplitude fluctuations of band-pass filtered signals.

208,208,"Background: Genome-wide association studies have identified the rs1006737 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CACNA1C gene as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. On the neural systems level this association is explained by altered functioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the hippocampal formation (HF), brain regions also affected by mental illness. In the present study we investigated the association of rs1006737 genotype with prefrontal activation and fronto-hippocampal connectivity. Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activation during an n-back working memory task in 94 healthy subjects. All subjects were genotyped for the SNP rs1006737. We tested associations of the rs1006737 genotype with changes in working-memory-related DLPFC activation and functional integration using a seed region functional connectivity approach. Results: Rs1006737 genotype was associated with altered right-hemispheric DLPFC activation. The homozygous A (risk) group showed decreased activation compared to G-allele carriers. Further, the functional connectivity analysis revealed a positive association of fronto-hippocampal connectivity with rs1006737 A alleles. Conclusions: We did not replicate the previous findings of increased right DLPFC activation in CACNA1C rs1006737 A homozygotes. In fact, we found the opposite effect, thus questioning prefrontal inefficiency as rs1006737 genotype-related intermediate phenotype. On the other hand, our results indicate that alterations in the functional coupling between the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe could represent a neural system phenotype that is mediated by CACNA1C rs1006737 and other genetic susceptibility loci for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

209,209,"Spontaneous fluctuations can be measured in the brain that reflect dissociable functional networks oscillating at synchronized frequencies, such as the default mode network (DMN). In contrast to its diametrically opposed task-positive counterpart, the DMN predominantly signals during a state of rest, and inappropriate regulation of this network has been associated with inattention, a core characteristic of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To examine whether abnormalities can be identified in the DMN component of patients with ADHD, we applied an independent components analysis to resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 22 male medication-naive adults with ADHD and 23 neurotypical individuals. We observed a stronger coherence of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) with the DMN component in patients with ADHD which correlated with measures of selective attention. The increased left dlPFC-DMN coherence also surfaced in a whole-brain replication analysis involving an independent sample of 9 medication-naive adult patients and 9 controls. In addition, a post hoc seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analysis using the dlPFC as a seed region to further examine this region's suggested connectivity differences uncovered a higher temporal coherence with various other neural networks and confirmed a reduced anticorrelation with the DMN. These results point to a more diffuse connectivity between functional networks in patients with ADHD. Moreover, our findings suggest that state-inappropriate neural activity in ADHD is not confined to DMN intrusion during attention-demanding contexts, but also surfaces as an insufficient suppression of dlPFC signaling in relation to DMN activity during rest. Together with previous findings, these results point to a general dysfunction in the orthogonality of functional networks. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1261-1272, 2014.

210,210,"Pattern classification methods have been widely investigated for analysis of brain images to assist the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By considering the nature of pathological changes, a large number of features related to both local brain regions and interbrain regions can be extracted for classification. However, it is challenging to design a single global classifier to integrate all these features for effective classification, due to the issue of small sample size. To this end, we propose a hierarchical ensemble classification method to combine multilevel classifiers by gradually integrating a large number of features from both local brain regions and interbrain regions. Thus, the large-scale classification problem can be divided into a set of small-scale and easier-to-solve problems in a bottom-up and local-to-global fashion, for more accurate classification. To demonstrate its performance, we use the spatially normalized grey matter (GM) of each MR brain image as imaging features. Specifically, we first partition the whole brain image into a number of local brain regions and, for each brain region, we build two low-level classifiers to transform local imaging features and the inter-region correlations into high-level features. Then, we generate multiple high-level classifiers, with each evaluating the high-level features from the respective brain regions. Finally, we combine the outputs of all high-level classifiers for making a final classification. Our method has been evaluated using the baseline MR images of 652 subjects (including 198 AD patients, 225 MCI patients, and 229 normal controls (NC)) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results show that our classification method can achieve the accuracies of 92.0% and 85.3% for classifications of AD versus NC and MCI versus NC, respectively, demonstrating very promising classification performance compared to the state-of-the-art classification methods.

212,212,"Fundamental to increasing our understanding of the role of white matter microstructure in normal/abnormal function in the living human is the development of MR-based metrics that provide increased specificity to distinct attributes of the white matter (e.g., local fibre architecture, axon morphology, and myelin content). In recent years, different approaches have been developed to enhance this specificity, and the Tractometty framework was introduced to combine the resulting multi-parametric data for a comprehensive assessment of white matter properties. The present work exploits that framework to characterise the statistical properties, specifically the variance and covariance, of these advanced microstructural indices across the major white matter pathways, with the aim of giving clear indications on the preferred metric(s) given the specific research question.

213,213,"Neuropsychiatric syndromes are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their neurobiology is not completely understood. New methods in functional magnetic resonance imaging, such as intrinsic functional connectivity or resting-state analysis, may help to clarify this issue. Using such approaches, alterations in the default-mode and salience networks (SNs) have been described in Alzheimer's, although their relationship with specific symptoms remains unclear. We therefore carried out resting-state functional connectivity analysis with 20 patients with mild to moderate AD, and correlated their scores on neuropsychiatric inventory syndromes (apathy, hyperactivity, affective syndrome, and psychosis) with maps of connectivity in the default mode network and SN. In addition, we compared network connectivity in these patients with that in 17 healthy elderly control subjects. All analyses were controlled for gray matter density and other potential confounds. Alzheimer's patients showed increased functional connectivity within the SN compared with controls (right anterior cingulate cortex and left medial frontal gyrus), along with reduced functional connectivity in the default-mode network (bilateral precuneus). A correlation between increased connectivity in anterior cingulate cortex and right insula areas of the SN and hyperactivity syndrome (agitation, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, euphoria, and disinhibition) was found. These findings demonstrate an association between specific network changes in AD and particular neuropsychiatric symptom types. This underlines the potential clinical significance of resting state alterations in future diagnosis and therapy. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1237-1246, 2014.

214,214,"The spectrum of cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) can span various domains, including executive function, language, attention, memory, and visuospatial skills. These symptoms may be attributable to the degradation of projection fibers associated with the underlying neurodegenerative process. The primary purpose of this study is to find microstructural correlates of impairments across these cognitive domains in PD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Sixteen patients with PD with comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and DTI data were retrospectively studied. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were assessed using regions-of-interest (ROI) analysis and confirmed with a voxel-based approach. Executive function directly correlated with FA and inversely correlated with MD in mostly frontal white matter tracts, especially the anterior limb of the internal capsule and genu of the corpus callosum. Likewise, language and attentional performance demonstrated correlations with DTI parameters in the frontal regions, but the attention domain additionally recruited regions widespread throughout the brain, with the most significant correlation identified in cingulate gyrus (cingulum). Lastly, memory impairment mainly involved MD alterations within the fornix. No significant correlations were found between visuospatial skills and DTI measures. Despite some overlap, unique patterns of white matter diffusivity underlie impairments in distinct cognitive domains in patients with PD. DTI combined with neurocognitive tests may be a valuable biomarker for identifying cognitive impairments in PD. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1325-1333, 2014.

215,215,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease, which primarily targets the motor system. The structural integrity of the motor network and the way it is embedded in the overall brain network is essential for motor functioning. We studied the longitudinal effects of ALS on the brain network using diffusion tensor imaging and questioned whether over time an increasing number of connections become involved or whether there is progressive impairment of a limited number of connections. The brain network was reconstructed based on whole brain diffusion tensor imaging data. We examined: (1) network integrity in 24 patients with ALS at baseline (T = 1) and at a more advanced stage of the disease (T = 2; interval 5.5 months) compared with a group of healthy controls and (2) progressive brain network impairment comparing patients at two time-points in a paired-analysis. These analyses demonstrated an expanding subnetwork of affected brain connections over time with a central role for the primary motor regions (P-values T = 1 0.003; T = 2 0.001). Loss of structural connectivity mainly propagated to frontal and parietal brain regions at T = 2 compared with T = 1. No progressive impairment of the initially affected (motor) connections could be detected. The main finding of this study is an increasing loss of network structure in patients with ALS. In contrast to the theory of ALS solely affecting a fixed set of primary motor connections, our findings show that the network of impaired connectivity is expanding over time. These results are in support of disease spread along structural brain connections. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1351-1361, 2014.

216,216,"Childhood adversity represents a major risk factor for drug addiction and other mental disorders. However, the specific mechanisms by which childhood adversity impacts human brain organization to confer greater vulnerability for negative outcomes in adulthood is largely unknown. As an impaired process in drug addiction, inhibitory control of behavior was investigated as a target of childhood maltreatment (abuse and neglect). Forty adults without Axis-I psychiatric disorders (21 females) completed a Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while performing a stop-signal task. A group independent component analysis identified a putative brain inhibitory control network. Graph theoretical analyses and structural equation modeling investigated the impact of childhood maltreatment on the functional organization of this neural processing network. Graph theory outcomes revealed sex differences in the relationship between network functional connectivity and inhibitory control which were dependent on the severity of childhood maltreatment exposure. A network effective connectivity analysis indicated that a maltreatment dose-related negative modulation of dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) activity by the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) predicted better response inhibition and lesser attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in females, but poorer response inhibition and greater ADHD symptoms in males. Less inhibition of the right IFC by dACC in males with higher CTQ scores improved inhibitory control ability. The childhood maltreatment-related reorganization of a brain inhibitory control network provides sex-dependent mechanisms by which childhood adversity may confer greater risk for drug use and related disorders and by which adaptive brain responses protect individuals from this risk factor.

Graph theoretical analyses and structural equation modeling investigated the impact of childhood maltreatment on the functional organization of this neural processing network. Graph theory outcomes revealed sex differences in the relationship between network functional connectivity and inhibitory control which were dependent on the severity of childhood maltreatment exposure. A network effective connectivity analysis indicated that a maltreatment dose-related negative modulation of dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) activity by the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) predicted better response inhibition and lesser attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in females, but poorer response inhibition and greater ADHD symptoms in males. Less inhibition of the right IFC by dACC in males with higher CTQ scores improved inhibitory control ability. The childhood maltreatment-related reorganization of a brain inhibitory control network provides sex-dependent mechanisms by which childhood adversity may confer greater risk for drug use and related disorders and by which adaptive brain responses protect individuals from this risk factor.

217,217,"Previous imaging studies that investigated morphometric group differences of subcortical regions outside the substantia nigra between non-demented Parkinson's patients and controls either did not find any significant differences, or reported contradictory results. Here, we performed a comprehensive morphometric analysis of 20 cognitively normal, early-stage PD patients and 19 matched control subjects. In addition to relatively standard analyses of whole-brain grey matter volume and overall regional volumes, we examined subtle localized surface shape differences in striatal and limbic grey matter structures and tested their utility as a diagnostic marker. Voxel-based morphometry and volumetric comparisons did not reveal significant group differences. Shape analysis, on the other hand, demonstrated significant between-group shape differences for the right pallidum. Careful diffusion tractography analysis showed that the affected parts of the pallidum are connected subcortically with the subthalamic nucleus, the pedunculopontine nucleus, and the thalamus and cortically with the frontal lobe. Additionally, microstructural measurements along these pathways, but not along other pallidal connections, were significantly different between the two groups. Vertex-wise linear discriminant analysis, however, revealed limited accuracy of pallidal shape for the discrimination between patients and controls. We conclude that localized disease-related changes in the right pallidum in early Parkinson's disease, undetectable using standard voxel-based morphometry or volumetry, are evident using sensitive shape analysis.

We used Generalized Ranking and Averaging Independent Component Analysis by Reproducibility (gRAICAR) to investigate the lifespan trajectories of intrinsic functional networks. By estimating individual-specific spatial components and aligning them across subjects, gRAICAR measures the spatial variation of component maps across a population without constraining the same components to appear in every subject In a cross-lifespan fMRI dataset (N = 126, 7-85 years old), we observed stronger age dependence in the spatial pattern of a precuneus-dorsal posterior cingulate cortex network compared to the default network, despite the fact that the two networks exhibit considerable spatial overlap and temporal correlation. These results remained even when analyses were restricted to a subpopulation with very similar head motion across age. Our analyses further showed that the two networks tend to merge with increasing age. Post-hoc analyses of functional connectivity confirmed the distinguishable cross-lifespan trajectories between the two networks. Based on these observations, we proposed a dynamic model of cross-lifespan functional segregation and integration between the two networks, suggesting that the precuneus network may have a different functional role than the default network, which declines with age.

220,219,"Segmentation of infant brain MR images is challenging due to poor spatial resolution, severe partial volume effect, and the ongoing maturation and myelination processes. During the first year of life, the brain image contrast between white and gray matters undergoes dramatic changes. In particular, the image contrast inverses around 6-8 months of age, where the white and gray matter tissues are isointense in T1 and T2 weighted images and hence exhibit the extremely low tissue contrast, posing significant challenges for automated segmentation. In this paper, we propose a general framework that adopts sparse representation to fuse the multi-modality image information and further incorporate the anatomical constraints for brain tissue segmentation. Specifically, we first derive an initial segmentation from a library of aligned images with ground-truth segmentations by using sparse representation in a patch-based fashion for the multi-modality T1, T2 and FA images. The segmentation result is further iteratively refined by integration of the anatomical constraint. The proposed method was evaluated on 22 infant brain MR images acquired at around 6 months of age by using a leave-one-out cross-validation, as well as other 10 unseen testing subjects. Our method achieved a high accuracy for the Dice ratios that measure the volume overlap between automated and manual segmentations, i.e., 0.889 +/- 0.008 for white matter and 0.870 +/- 0.006 for gray matter.

221,220,"Deficits in social cognition seem to present an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia, and are known to be associated with an altered amygdala response to faces. However, current results are heterogeneous with respect to whether this altered amygdala response in schizophrenia is hypoactive or hyperactive in nature. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate emotion-specific amygdala activation in schizophrenia using a novel adaptive emotion recognition paradigm. Participants comprised 11 schizophrenia outpatients and 16 healthy controls who viewed face stimuli expressing emotions of anger, fear, happiness, and disgust, as well as neutral expressions. The adaptive emotion recognition approach allows the assessment of group differences in both emotion recognition performance and associated neuronal activity while also ensuring a comparable number of correctly recognized emotions between groups. Schizophrenia participants were slower and had a negative bias in emotion recognition. In addition, they showed reduced differential activation during recognition of emotional compared with neutral expressions. Correlation analyses revealed an association of a negative bias with amygdala activation for neutral facial expressions that was specific to the patient group. We replicated previous findings of affected emotion recognition in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we demonstrated that altered amygdala activation in the patient group was associated with the occurrence of a negative bias. These results provide further evidence for impaired social cognition in schizophrenia and point to a central role of the amygdala in negative misperceptions of facial stimuli in schizophrenia.

222,221,"Objectives To date, only four small studies have investigated the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer on the microstructure of cerebral white matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These studies, which were conducted shortly up to 10 years post-treatment, showed that chemotherapy is associated with focal loss of microstructural white matter integrity. We investigated the long-term effect of chemotherapy on white matter microstructural integrity by comparing the brains of chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors to those of a population-based sample of women without a history of cancer. Experimental design Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI (1.5 T) was performed in 187 CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-flourouracil) chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors, mean age 64.2 (sd = 6.5) years, who had been diagnosed with cancer on average 21.2 (sd = 4.4) years before, and 374 age-matched cancer-free reference subjects from a population-based cohort study. Outcome measures were whole-brain microstructural integrity as measured by fractional anisotropy and mean/axial/radial diffusivity and focal white matter integrity, which was analyzed with tract-based spatial statistics. All analyses were adjusted for age, cardiovascular risk factors, education, and symptoms of depression. Principal observations No significant group differences were observed in white matter integrity. However, within the breast cancer survivors, time since treatment was inversely associated with lower global and focal white matter integrity. Conclusions This cross-sectional study suggests that among chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors white matter microstructural integrity deteriorates with accumulating time since treatment.

223,222,"Speech recognition is robust to background noise. One underlying neural mechanism is that the auditory system segregates speech from the listening background and encodes it reliably. Such robust internal representation has been demonstrated in auditory cortex by neural activity entrained to the temporal envelope of speech. A paradox, however, then arises, as the spectro-temporal fine structure rather than the temporal envelope is known to be the major cue to segregate target speech from background noise. Does the reliable cortical entrainment in fact reflect a robust internal ""synthesis"" of the attended speech stream rather than direct tracking of the acoustic envelope? Here, we test this hypothesis by degrading the spectro-temporal fine structure while preserving the temporal envelope using vocoders. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings reveal that cortical entrainment to vocoded speech is severely degraded by background noise, in contrast to the robust entrainment to natural speech. Furthermore, cortical entrainment in the delta-band (1-4 Hz) predicts the speech recognition score at the level of individual listeners. These results demonstrate that reliable cortical entrainment to speech relies on the spectro-temporal fine structure, and suggest that cortical entrainment to the speech envelope is not merely a representation of the speech envelope but a coherent representation of multiscale spectro-temporal features that are synchronized to the syllabic and phrasal rhythms of speech.

225,224,"Cognitive dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is closely related to altered functional brain network topology. Conventional network analyses to compare groups are hampered by differences in network size, density and suffer from normalization problems. We therefore computed the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), a sub-graph of the original network, to counter these problems. We hypothesize that functional network changes analysed with MSTs are important for understanding cognitive changes in MS and that changes in MST topology also represent changes in the critical backbone of the original brain networks. Here, restingstate magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 21 early MS patients and 17 age-, gender-, and education-matched controls were projected onto atlas-based regions-of-interest (ROIs) using beamforming. The phase lag index was applied to compute functional connectivity between regions, from which a graph and subsequently the MST was constructed. Results showed lower global integration in the alpha2 (10-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands in MS patients, whereas higher global integration was found in the theta band. Changes were most pronounced in the alpha2 band where a loss of hierarchical structure was observed, which was associated with poorer cognitive performance. Finally, the MST in MS patients as well as in healthy controls may represent the critical backbone of the original network. Together, these findings indicate that MST network analyses are able to detect network changes in MS patients, which may correspond to changes in the core of functional brain networks. Moreover, these changes, such as a loss of hierarchical structure, are related to cognitive performance in MS.

226,225,"Although hoarding disorder (HD) has been historically conceptualized as a subtype or dimension of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), preliminary evidence suggests that these two disorders have distinct neural underpinnings. The aim of the present study was to compare the hemodynamic responses of HD patients, OCD patients, and healthy controls (HC) during response inhibition on a high-conflict Go/NoGo task that has previously proved sensitive to OCD. Participants comprised 24 HD patients, 24 OCD patients, and 24 HCs who completed a Go/NoGo task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (MARI). Although behavioral data showed no difference among the groups in Go/NoGo task performance, significant differences in hemodynamic activity were noted. During correct rejects (successful response inhibition), HD patients showed greater right precentral gyrus activation, whereas OCD patients exhibited greater right orbitofrontal activation, as assessed using a region of interest approach. During errors of commission (response inhibition failures), OCD patients, but not HD patients, were characterized by excessive activity in left and right orbitofrontal gyrus. The present results lend further support to the biological distinction between HD and OCD, and they are consistent with previous research suggesting frontal hypoactivity in HD patients during hoarding-unrelated tasks.

227,226,"Neuroimaging studies in the last 20 years have tried to unravel the neural correlates of number processing across formats in humans and non-human primates. Results point to the intraparietal sulcus as the core area for an abstract representation of numerical quantity. On the other hand, there exist a variety of behavioral and neuroimaging data that are difficult to reconcile with the existence of such an abstract representation. In this study, we addressed this issue by applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data to unravel the neural representations of symbolic (digits) and non-symbolic (dots) numbers and their possible overlap on three different spatial scales (entire lobules, smaller regions of interest and a searchlight analysis with 2-voxel radius). Results showed that numbers in both formats are decodable in occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal regions. However, there were no overlapping representations between dots and digits on any of the spatial scales. These data suggest that the human brain does not contain an abstract representation of numerical magnitude. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Several clinical studies suggest that tDCS may have clinically meaningful efficacy in the treatment of depression. The objective of this study was to simulate and compare the effects of several tDCS montages either used in clinical trials or proposed, for the treatment of depression, in different high-resolution anatomically-accurate head models. Detailed segmented finite element head models of two subjects were presented, and a total of eleven tDCS electrode montages were simulated. Sensitivity analysis on the effects of changing the size of the anode, rotating both electrodes and displacing the anode was also conducted on selected montages. The F3-F8 and F3-F4 montages have been used in clinical trials reporting significant antidepressant effects and both result in relatively high electric fields in dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Other montages using a fronto-extracephalic or fronto-occipital approach result in greater stimulation of central structures (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex) which may be advantageous in treating depression, but their efficacy has yet to be tested in randomised controlled trials.

229,228,"There have been a number of studies suggesting that oscillatory alpha activity (-10 Hz) plays a pivotal role in attention by gating information flow to relevant sensory regions. The vast majority of these studies have looked at shifts of attention in the spatial domain and only in a single modality (often visual or sensorimotor). In the current magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we investigated the role of alpha activity in the suppression of a distracting modality stream. We used a cross-modal attention task where visual cues indicated whether participants had to judge a visual orientation or discriminate the auditory pitch of an upcoming target. The visual and auditory targets were presented either simultaneously or alone, allowing us to behaviorally gauge the ""cost"" of having a distractor present in each modality. We found that the preparation for visual discrimination (relative to pitch discrimination) resulted in a decrease of alpha power (9-11 Hz) in the early visual cortex, with a concomitant increase in alpha/beta power (14-16 Hz) in the supramarginal gyro, a region suggested to play a vital role in short-term storage of pitch information (Gaab et al., 2003). On a trial-by-trial basis, alpha power over the visual areas was significantly correlated with increased visual discrimination times, whereas alpha power over the precuneus and right superior temporal gyrus was correlated with increased auditory discrimination times. However, these correlations were only significant when the targets were paired with distractors. Our work adds to increasing evidence that the top-down (i.e. attentional) modulation of alpha activity is a mechanism by which stimulus processing can be gated within the cortex. Here, we find that this phenomenon is not restricted to the domain of spatial attention and can be generalized to other sensory modalities than vision. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

230,229,"Functional brain imaging studies have shown abnormal neural activity in individuals recovered from anorexia nervosa (AN) during both cognitive and emotional task paradigms. It has been suggested that this abnormal activity which persists into recovery might underpin the neurobiology of the disorder and constitute a neural biomarker for AN. However, no study to date has assessed functional changes in neural networks in the absence of task-induced activity in those recovered from AN. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whole brain resting state functional connectivity in nonmedicated women recovered from anorexia nervosa. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 16 nonmedicated participants recovered from anorexia nervosa and 15 healthy control participants. Independent component analysis revealed functionally relevant resting state networks. Dual regression analysis revealed increased temporal correlation (coherence) in the default mode network (DMN) which is thought to be involved in self-referential processing. Specifically, compared to healthy control participants the recovered anorexia nervosa participants showed increased temporal coherence between the DMN and the precuneus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/inferior frontal gyrus. The findings support the view that dysfunction in resting state functional connectivity in regions involved in self-referential processing and cognitive control might be a vulnerability marker for the development of anorexia nervosa.

231,230,"There is accumulating evidence that at current acquisition resolutions for diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, the vast majority of white matter voxels contains ""crossing fibers"", referring to complex fiber configurations in which multiple and distinctly differently oriented fiber populations exist. Spherical deconvolution based techniques are appealing to characterize this DW intra-voxel signal heterogeneity, as they provide a balanced trade-off between constraints on the required hardware performance and acquisition time on the one hand, and the reliability of the reconstructed fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) on the other hand. Recent findings, however, suggest that an inaccurate calibration of the response function (RF), which represents the DW signal profile of a single fiber orientation, can lead to the detection of spurious fODF peaks which, in turn, can have a severe impact on tractography results.

232,231,"Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a widely-used structural neuroimaging technique for comparing meso- and macroscopic regional brain volumes between patients and controls in vivo, but some of its steps, particularly the modulation, lack an experimental validation. The aims of this study were two-fold: a) to assess the effects of modulation to detect mesoscopic (i.e. between microscopic and macroscopic) abnormalities on published, classic VBM; and b) to suggest a set of potentially optimal settings for detecting mesoscopic abnormalities with new, advanced, high-resolution diffeomorphic VBM normalization algorithms. Sensitivity and false positive rate after modulating or not in classic VBM using different software packages and spatial statistics, and after setting a range of different parameters in advanced VBM (ANTS-SyN), were calculated in 10 VBM comparisons of 32 altered vs. 32 unaltered gray matter images from different healthy controls. Simulated brain abnormalities comprised mesoscopic volume differences mainly due to cortical thinning. In classic VBM, modulation was associated with a substantial decrease of the sensitivity to detect mesoscopic abnormalities (p < 0.001). Optimal settings for advanced VBM included the omission of modulation, the use of large smoothing kernels, and the application of voxel-based or threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) spatial statistics. The modulation-related decrease in sensitivity was due to an increase in variance, and it was more severe in higher-resolution normalization algorithms. Findings from this study suggest the use of unmodulated VBM to detect mesoscopic abnormalities such as cortical thinning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

233,232,"Flow refers to a positive, activity-associated, subjective experience under conditions of a perceived fit between skills and task demands. Using functional magnetic resonance perfusion imaging, we investigated the neural correlates of flow in a sample of 27 human subjects. Experimentally, in the flow condition participants worked on mental arithmetic tasks at challenging task difficulty which was automatically and continuously adjusted to individuals' skill level. Experimental settings of ""boredom"" and ""overload"" served as comparison conditions. The experience of flow was associated with relative increases in neural activity in the left anterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the left putamen. Relative decreases in neural activity were observed in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the amygdala (AMY). Subjective ratings of the flow experience were significantly associated with changes in neural activity in the IFG, AMY, and, with trend towards significance, in the MPFC. We conclude that neural activity changes in these brain regions reflect psychological processes that map on the characteristic features of flow: coding of increased outcome probability (putamen), deeper sense of cognitive control (IFG), decreased self-referential processing (MPFC), and decreased negative arousal (AMY).

234,233,"Structural brain networks constructed from diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tractography have been demonstrated in healthy volunteers and more recently in various disorders affecting brain connectivity. However, few studies have addressed the reproducibility of the resulting networks. We measured the test-retest properties of such networks by varying several factors affecting network construction using ten healthy volunteers who underwent a dMRI protocol at 1.5 Ton two separate occasions. Each T-1-weighted brain was parcellated into 84 regions-of-interest and network connections were identified using dMRI and two alternative tractography algorithms, two alternative seeding strategies, a white matter way-point constraint and three alternative network weightings. In each case, four common graph-theoretic measures were obtained. Network properties were assessed both node-wise and per network in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and by comparing within- and between-subject differences. Our findings suggest that test-retest performance was improved when: 1) seeding from white matter, rather than grey; and 2) using probabilistic tractography with a two-fibre model and sufficient streamlines, rather than deterministic tensor tractography. In terms of network weighting, a measure of streamline density produced better test-retest performance than tract-averaged diffusion anisotropy, although it remains unclear which is a more accurate representation of the underlying connectivity. For the best performing configuration, the global within-subject differences were between 3.2% and 11.9% with ICCs between 0.62 and 0.76. The mean nodal within-subject differences were between 5.2% and 24.2% with mean ICCs between 0.46 and 0.62. For.83.3% (70/84) of nodes, the within-subject differences were smaller than between-subject differences. Overall, these findings suggest that whilst current techniques produce networks capable of characterising the genuine between-subject differences in connectivity, future work must be undertaken to improve network reliability.

235,234,"Seizure freedom after resective epilepsy surgery is not obtained in a substantial number of patients with medically intractable epilepsy. Functional neural network analysis is a promising technique for more accurate identification of the target areas for epilepsy surgery, but a better understanding of the correlations between changes in functional network organization due to surgery and postoperative seizure status is required. We explored these correlations in longitudinal magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of 20 lesional epilepsy patients. Resting-state MEG recordings were obtained at baseline (preoperatively; TO) and at 3-7 (T1) and 9-15 months after resection (T2). We assessed frequency-specific functional connectivity and performed a minimum spanning tree (MST) network analysis. The MST captures the most important connections in the network. We found a significant positive correlation between functional connectivity in the lower alpha band and seizure frequency at TO, especially in regions where lesions were located. MST leaf fraction, a measure of integration of information in the network, was significantly increased between TO and T2, only for the seizurefree patients. This is in line with previous work, which showed that lower functional network integration in lesional epilepsy patients is related to higher epilepsy burden. Finally, eccentricity and betweenness centrality, which are measures of hub-status, decreased between TO and T2 in seizure free patients, also in regions that were anatomically close to resection cavities. Our results increase insight into functional network changes in successful epilepsy surgery and might eventually be utilized for optimization of neurosurgical approaches.

236,235,"Voluntary action control requires selection of appropriate responses and stopping of inappropriate responses. Selection and stopping are often investigated separately, but they appear to recruit similar brain regions, including the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) and inferior frontal gyrus. We therefore examined the evidence for overlap of selection and stopping using two approaches: a meta-analysis of existing studies of selection and stopping, and a novel within-subject fMRI study in which action selection and a stop signal task were combined factorially. The novel fMRI study also permitted us to investigate hypotheses regarding a common mechanism for selection and stopping. The preSMA was identified by both methods as common to selection and stopping. However, stopping a selected action did not recruit preSMA more than stopping a specified action, nor did stop signal reaction times differ significantly across the two conditions. These findings suggest that the preSMA supports both action selection and stopping, but the two processes may not require access to a common inhibition mechanism. Instead, the preSMA might represent information about potential actions that is used in both action selection and stopping in order to resolve conflict between competing available responses.

237,236,"The amygdala, a small deep brain structure involved in behavioral processing through interactions with other brain regions, has garnered increased attention in recent years in relation to pain processing. As pain is a multidimensional experience that encompasses physical sensation, affect, and cognition, the amygdala is well suited to play a part in this process. Multiple neuroimaging studies of pain in humans have reported activation in the amygdala. Here, we summarize these studies by performing a coordinate-based meta-analysis within experimentally induced and clinical pain studies using an activation likelihood estimate analysis. The results are presented in relation to locations of peak activation within and outside of amygdala subregions. The majority of studies identified coordinates consistent with human amygdala cytoarchitecture indicating reproducibility in neuroanatomical labeling across labs, analysis methods, and imaging modalities. Differences were noted between healthy and clinical pain studies: in clinical pain studies, peak activation was located in the laterobasal region, suggestive of the cognitive-affective overlay present among individuals suffering from chronic pain; while the less understood superficial region of the amygdala was prominent among experimental pain studies. Taken together, these findings suggest several important directions for further research exploring the amygdala's role in pain processing. Hum Brain Mapp 35:527-538, 2014.

238,237,"The search for an Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker is one of the most relevant contemporary research topics due to the high prevalence and social costs of the disease. Functional connectivity (PC) of the default mode network (DMN) is a plausible candidate for such a biomarker. We evaluated 22 patients with mild AD and 26 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. All subjects underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a 3.0 T scanner. To identify the DMN, seed-based FC of the posterior cingulate was calculated. We also measured the sensitivity/specificity of the method, and verified a correlation with cognitive performance. We found a significant difference between patients with mild AD and controls in average z-scores: DMN, whole cortical positive (WCP) and absolute values. DMN individual values showed a sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 70%. DMN and WCP values were correlated to global cognition and episodic memory performance. We showed that individual measures of DMN connectivity could be considered a promising method to differentiate AD, even at an early phase, from normal aging.

239,238,"There is now considerable evidence that white matter abnormalities play a role in the neurobiology of autism. Little research has been directed, however, at understanding (a) typical white matter development in autism and how this relates to neurocognitive impairments observed in the disorder. In this study we used probabilistic tractography to identify the cingulum bundle in 21 adolescents and young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. We investigated group differences in the relationships between age and fractional anisotropy, a putative measure of white matter integrity, within the cingulum bundle. Moreover, in a preliminary investigation, we examined the relationship between cingulum fractional anisotropy and executive functioning using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). The ASD participants demonstrated significantly lower fractional anisotropy within the cingulum bundle compared to the typically developing volunteers. There was a significant group-by-age interaction such that the ASD group did not show the typical age-associated increases in fractional anisotropy observed among healthy individuals. Moreover, lower fractional anisotropy within the cingulum bundle was associated with worse BRIEF behavioral regulation index scores in the ASD group. The current findings implicate a dysregulation in cingulum bundle white matter development occurring in late adolescence and early adulthood in ASD, and suggest that greater disturbances in this trajectory are associated with executive dysfunction in ASD.

240,239,"The aim of this study was to investigate findings of positron emission tomography with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG PET) in normal subjects to clarify the effects of sex differences, aging, and cognitive reserve on cerebral glucose metabolism. Participants comprised 123 normal adults who underwent F-18-FDO PET and a neuropsychological battery. We used statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) to investigate sex differences, and aging effects. The effects of cognitive reserve on 18F-FDO uptake were investigated using years of education as a proxy. Finally, we studied the effect of cognitive reserve on the recruitment of glucose metabolism in a memory task by dichotomizing the data according to educational level. Our results showed that the overall cerebral glucose metabolism in females was higher than that in males, whereas male participants had higher glucose metabolism in the bilateral inferior temporal gyri and cerebellum than females. Age-related hypometabolism was found in anterior regions, including the anterior cingulate gyms. These areas are part of the attentional system, which may decline with aging even in healthy elderly individuals. Highly educated subjects revealed focal hypermetabolism in the right hemisphere and lower recruitment of glucose metabolism in memory tasks. This phenomenon is likely a candidate for a neural substrate of cognitive reserve. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

241,240,"Near-infrared neuromonitoring (NIN) is based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements performed through the intact scalp and skull. Despite the important effects of overlying tissue layers on the measurement of brain hemodynamics, the influence of scalp and skull on NIN sensitivity are not well characterized. Using 3555 Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated the sensitivity of individual continuous-wave NIRS measurements to brain activity over the entire adult human head by introducing a small absorption perturbation to brain gray matter and quantifying the influence of scalp and skull thickness on this sensitivity. After segmenting the Colin27 template into five tissue types (scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter), the average scalp thickness was 6.9 +/- 3.6 mm (range: 3.6-11.2 mm), while the average skull thickness was 6.0 +/- 1.9 mm (range: 2.5-10.5 mm). Mean NIN sensitivity - defined as the partial path length through gray matter divided by the total photon path length - ranged from 0.06 (i.e., 6% of total path length) at a 20 mm source-detector separation, to over 0.19 at 50 mm separations. NIN sensitivity varied substantially around the head, with occipital pole exhibiting the highest NIRS sensitivity to gray matter, whereas inferior frontal regions had the lowest sensitivity. Increased scalp and skull thickness were strongly associated with decreased sensitivity to brain tissue. Scalp thickness always exhibited a slightly larger effect on sensitivity than skull thickness, but the effect of both varied with SD separation. We quantitatively characterize sensitivity around the head as well as the effects of scalp and skull, which can be used to interpret NIN brain activation studies as well as guide the design, development and optimization of NIRS devices and sensors.

242,241,"The present study aims to gain insights into the effects of training with a motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) on activation patterns of the sensorimotor cortex. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate long-term training effects across 10 sessions using a 2-class (right hand and feet) MI-based BCI in fifteen subjects. In the course of the training a significant enhancement of activation pattern emerges, represented by an [oxy-Hb] increase in fNIRS and a stronger event-related desynchronization in the upper beta-frequency band in the EEG. These effects were only visible in participants with relatively low BCI performance (mean accuracy <= 70%). We found that training with an MI-based BCI affects cortical activation patterns especially in users with low BCI performance. Our results may serve as a valuable contribution to the field of BCI research and provide information about the effects that training with an MI-based BCI has on cortical activation patterns.

243,242,"To quantify the effect of absorption changes in the deep tissue (cerebral) and shallow tissue (scalp, skin) layers on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals, a method using multi-distance (MD) optodes and independent component analysis (ICA), referred to as the MD-ICA method, is proposed. In previous studies, when the signal from the shallow tissue layer (shallow signal) needs to be eliminated, it was often assumed that the shallow signal had no correlation with the signal from the deep tissue layer (deep signal). In this study, no relationship between the waveforms of deep and shallow signals is assumed, and instead, it is assumed that both signals are linear combinations of multiple signal sources, which allows the inclusion of a ""shared component"" (such as systemic signals) that is contained in both layers. The method also assumes that the partial optical path length of the shallow layer does not change, whereas that of the deep layer linearly increases along with the increase of the source-detector (S-D) distance. Deep- and shallow-layer contribution ratios of each independent component (IC) are calculated using the dependence of the weight of each IC on the S-D distance. Reconstruction of deep- and shallow-layer signals are performed by the sum of ICs weighted by the deep and shallow contribution ratio. Experimental validation of the principle of this technique was conducted using a dynamic phantom with two absorbing layers. Results showed that our method is effective for evaluating deep-layer contributions even if there are high correlations between deep and shallow signals. Next, we applied the method to fNIRS signals obtained on a human head with 5-, 15-, and 30-mm S-D distances during a verbal fluency task, a verbal working memory task (prefrontal area), a finger tapping task (motor area), and a tetrametric visual checker-board task (occipital area) and then estimated the deep-layer contribution ratio. To evaluate the signal separation performance of our method, we used the correlation coefficients of a laser-Doppler flowmetly (LDF) signal and a nearest 5-mm S-D distance channel signal with the shallow signal. We demonstrated that the shallow signals have a higher temporal correlation with the LDF signals and with the 5-mm S-D distance channel than the deep signals. These results show the MD-ICA method can discriminate between deep and shallow signals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

244,243,"Recently, real time imaging of the cortical control of gait became possible with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). So far, little is known about the activations of various cortical areas in more complex forms of gait, such as precision stepping. From previous work on animals and humans one would expect precision stepping to elicit extra activity in the sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), as well as in prefrontal cortices (PFC). In the current study, hemodynamic changes in the PFC, SMA, M1, and S1 were measured with fNIRS. In contrast to previous fNIRS gait studies, the technique was optimized by the use of reference channels (to correct for superficial hemodynamic interference). Eleven subjects randomly performed ten trials of treadmill walking at 3 km/h (normal walking) and ten trials of 3 km/h treadmill walking on predefined spots for the left and right foot presented on the treadmill (precision stepping). The walking trials of approximately 35 seconds were alternated with rest periods of 25-35 seconds consisting of quiet standing. The PFC revealed profound activation just prior to the onset of both walking tasks. There was also extra activation of the PFC during the first half of the task period for precision stepping. The SMA showed mainly increased activation prior to the start of both tasks. In contrast, the sensorimotor cortex did not show a change in activation during either task as compared to a condition of standing. The SMA, Ml, and S1 revealed no significant differences between normal walking and precision stepping. It was concluded that fNIRS is suited to record the planning and initiation of gait. The lack of M1/S1 activation during gait suggests that even in the current precision stepping task the control of ongoing gait depended mostly on subcortical automatisms, while motor cortex contributions did not differ between standing and walking.

245,244,"Brain aging is characterized by changes in both hemodynamic and neuronal responses, which may be influenced by the cardiorespiratory fitness of the individual. To investigate the relationship between neuronal and hemodynamic changes, we studied the brain activity elicited by visual stimulation (checker-board reversals at different frequencies) in younger adults and in older adults varying in physical fitness. Four functional brain measures were used to compare neuronal and hemodynamic responses obtained from BA17: two reflecting neuronal activity (the event-related optical signal, EROS, and the Cl response of the ERP), and two reflecting functional hemodynamic changes (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, and near-infrared spectroscopy, NIRS). The results indicated that both younger and older adults exhibited a quadratic relationship between neuronal and hemodynamic effects, with reduced increases of the hemodynamic response at high levels of neuronal activity. Although older adults showed reduced activation, similar neurovascular coupling functions were observed in the two age groups when fMRI and deoxy-hemoglobin measures were used. However, the coupling between oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin changes decreased with age and increased with increasing fitness.

246,245,"Blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been one of the ""signature injuries"" of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, neuroimaging studies in concussive 'mild' blast-related TBI have been challenging due to the absence of abnormalities in computed tomography or conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the heterogeneity of the blast-related injury mechanisms. The goal of this study was to address these challenges utilizing single-subject, module-based graph theoretic analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data. We acquired 20 min of resting-state fMRI in 63 U.S. military personnel clinically diagnosed with concussive blast-related TBI and 21 U.S. military controls who had blast exposures but no diagnosis of TBI. All subjects underwent an initial scan within 90 days post-injury and 65 subjects underwent a follow-up scan 6 to 12 months later. A second independent cohort of 40 U.S. military personnel with concussive blast-related TBI served as a validation dataset The second independent cohort underwent an initial scan within 30 days post-injury. 75% of the scans were of good quality, with exclusions primarily due to excessive subject motion. Network analysis of the subset of these subjects in the first cohort with good quality scans revealed spatially localized reductions in the participation coefficient, a measure of between-module connectivity, in the TBI patients relative to the controls at the time of the initial scan. These group differences were less prominent on the follow-up scans. The 15 brain areas with the most prominent reductions in the participation coefficient were next used as regions of interest (ROIs) for single-subject analyses. In the first TBI cohort, more subjects than would be expected by chance (27/47 versus 2/47 expected, p < 0.0001) had 3 or more brain regions with abnormally low between-module connectivity relative to the controls on the initial scans. On the follow-up scans, more subjects than expected by chance (5/37, p = 0.044) but fewer subjects than on the initial scans had 3 or more brain regions with abnormally low between-module connectivity. Analysis of the second TBI cohort validation dataset with no free parameters provided a partial replication; again more subjects than expected by chance (8/31, p = 0.006) had 3 or more brain regions with abnormally low between-module connectivity on the initial scans, but the numbers were not significant (2/27, p = 0.276) on the follow-up scans. A single-subject, multivariate analysis by probabilistic principal component analysis of the between-module connectivity in the 15 identified ROIs, showed that 31/47 subjects in the first TBI cohort were found to be abnormal relative to the controls on the initial scans.

246,245,"Blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been one of the ""signature injuries"" of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, neuroimaging studies in concussive 'mild' blast-related TBI have been challenging due to the absence of abnormalities in computed tomography or conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the heterogeneity of the blast-related injury mechanisms. The goal of this study was to address these challenges utilizing single-subject, module-based graph theoretic analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data. We acquired 20 min of resting-state fMRI in 63 U.S. military personnel clinically diagnosed with concussive blast-related TBI and 21 U.S. military controls who had blast exposures but no diagnosis of TBI. All subjects underwent an initial scan within 90 days post-injury and 65 subjects underwent a follow-up scan 6 to 12 months later. A second independent cohort of 40 U.S. military personnel with concussive blast-related TBI served as a validation dataset The second independent cohort underwent an initial scan within 30 days post-injury. 75% of the scans were of good quality, with exclusions primarily due to excessive subject motion. Network analysis of the subset of these subjects in the first cohort with good quality scans revealed spatially localized reductions in the participation coefficient, a measure of between-module connectivity, in the TBI patients relative to the controls at the time of the initial scan. These group differences were less prominent on the follow-up scans. The 15 brain areas with the most prominent reductions in the participation coefficient were next used as regions of interest (ROIs) for single-subject analyses. In the first TBI cohort, more subjects than would be expected by chance (27/47 versus 2/47 expected, p < 0.0001) had 3 or more brain regions with abnormally low between-module connectivity relative to the controls on the initial scans. On the follow-up scans, more subjects than expected by chance (5/37, p = 0.044) but fewer subjects than on the initial scans had 3 or more brain regions with abnormally low between-module connectivity.

247,246,"Many cognitive and clinical neuroscience research studies seek to determine how contextual factors modulate cognitive processes. In IMRI, hypotheses about how context modulates distributed patterns of information processing are often tested by comparing functional connectivity between neural regions A and B as a function of task conditions X and Y, which is termed context-modulated functional connectivity (FC). There exist two exploratory statistical approaches to testing context-modulated FC: the beta-series method and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis methods. While these approaches are commonly used, their relative power for detecting context-modulated FC is unknown, especially with respect to real-world experimental parameters (e.g., number of stimulus repetitions, inter-trial-interval, stimulus duration). Here, we use simulations to compare power for detecting context-modulated FC between the standard PPI formulation (sPPI), generalized PPI formulation (gPPI), and beta series methods. Simulation results demonstrate that gPPI and beta series methods are generally more powerful than sPPI. Whether gPPI or beta series methods performed more powerfully depended on experiment parameters: block designs favor the gPPI, whereas the beta series method was more powerful for designs with more trial repetitions and it also retained more power under conditions of hemodynamic response function variability. On a real dataset of adolescent girls, the PPI methods appeared to have greater sensitivity in detecting task-modulated FC when using a block design and the beta series method appeared to have greater sensitivity when using an event-related design with many trial repetitions. Implications of these performance results are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

248,247,"Since the early days of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), retinotopic mapping emerged as a powerful and widely-accepted tool, allowing the identification of individual visual cortical fields and furthering the study of visual processing. In contrast, tonotopic mapping in auditory cortex proved more challenging primarily because of the smaller size of auditory cortical fields. The spatial resolution capabilities of fMRI have since advanced, and recent reports from our labs and several others demonstrate the reliability of tonotopic mapping in human auditory cortex. Here we review the wide range of stimulus procedures and analysis methods that have been used to successfully map tonotopy in human auditory cortex. We point out that recent studies provide a remarkably consistent view of human tonotopic organisation, although the interpretation of the maps continues to vary. In particular, there remains controversy over the exact orientation of the primary gradients with respect to Heschl's gyrus, which leads to different predictions about the location of human A1, R, and surrounding fields. We discuss the development of this debate and argue that literature is converging towards an interpretation that core fields A1 and R fold across the rostral and caudal banks of Heschl's gyrus, with tonotopic gradients laid out in a distinctive V-shaped manner. This suggests an organisation that is largely homologous with non-human primates. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Human Auditory Neuroimaging>. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

249,248,"The importance of studying connectivity in the aging brain is increasingly recognized. Recent studies have shown that connectivity within the default mode network is reduced with age and have demonstrated a clear relation of these changes with cognitive functioning. However, research on age-related changes in other functional networks is sparse and mainly focused on prespecified functional networks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity during a visual oddball task in a range of functional networks. It was found that compared with young participants, elderly showed a decrease in connectivity between areas belonging to the same functional network. This was found in the default mode network and the somatomotor network. Moreover, in all identified networks, elderly showed increased connectivity between areas within these networks and areas belonging to different functional networks. Decreased connectivity within functional networks was related to poorer cognitive functioning in elderly. The results were interpreted as a decrease in the specificity of functional networks in older participants. Hum Brain Mapp 35:319-330, 2014.

250,249,"The biological model of extraversion and neuroticism identified by Eysenck has stimulated increasing interest in uncovering neurobiological substrate of the two fundamental dimensions. Here we aim to explore brain disturbances underlying extraversion and neuroticism in 87 healthy individuals using fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (LFF) on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Two different frequency bands, Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) exhibiting higher power and involving larger brain regions, and Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) exhibiting less power and emerging locally, were analyzed. Our results showed a positive correlation between LFF amplitude at Slow-5 and extraversion in medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, important portions of the default mode network, thus suggesting a link between default network activity and personality traits. LFF amplitude at Slow-5 was correlated positively with neuroticism in right posterior portion of the frontal lobe, further validating neuroticism with frontal lateralization. In addition, LFF amplitude at Slow-4 was negatively associated with extraversion and neuroticism in left hippocampus (HIP) and bilateral superior temporal cortex (STC) respectively, supporting the hypothesized (inverse) relationship between extraversion and resting arousal, also implying neural circuit underlying emotional process influencing on personality. Overall, these findings suggest the important relationships, between personality and LFF amplitude dynamic, depend on specific frequency bands. Hum Brain Mapp 35:331-339, 2014.

251,250,"Although structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed partly non-overlapping brain abnormalities in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, it is unknown whether structural MRI scans can be used to separate individuals with schizophrenia from those with bipolar disorder. An algorithm capable of discriminating between these two disorders could become a diagnostic aid for psychiatrists. Here, we scanned 66 schizophrenia patients, 66 patients with bipolar disorder and 66 healthy subjects on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Three support vector machines were trained to separate patients with schizophrenia from healthy subjects, patients with schizophrenia from those with bipolar disorder, and patients with bipolar disorder from healthy subjects, respectively, based on their gray matter density images. The predictive power of the models was tested using cross-validation and in an independent validation set of 46 schizophrenia patients, 47 patients with bipolar disorder and 43 healthy subjects scanned on a 3 T MRI scanner. Schizophrenia patients could be separated from healthy subjects with an average accuracy of 90%. Additionally, schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar disorder could be distinguished with an average accuracy of 88%.The model delineating bipolar patients from healthy subjects was less accurate, correctly classifying 67% of the healthy subjects and only 53% of the patients with bipolar disorder. In the latter group, lithium and antipsychotics use had no influence on the classification results. Application of the 1.5 T models on the 3 T validation set yielded average classification accuracies of 76% (healthy vs schizophrenia), 66% (bipolar vs schizophrenia) and 61% (healthy vs bipolar). In conclusion, the accurate separation of schizophrenia from bipolar patients on the basis of structural MRI scans, as demonstrated here, could be of added value in the differential diagnosis of these two disorders. The results also suggest that gray matter pathology in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder differs to such an extent that they can be reliably differentiated using machine learning paradigms.

However, given that boundaries between subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) are conventionally defined on the basis of microscopic features that often lack discernible signature in MRI, subfield delineation in MRI literature has largely relied on heuristic geometric rules, the validity of which with respect to the underlying anatomy is largely unknown. The development and evaluation of such rules are challenged by the limited availability of data linking MRI appearance to microscopic hippocampal anatomy, particularly in three dimensions (3D). The present paper, for the first time, demonstrates the feasibility of labeling hippocampal subfields in a high resolution volumetric MRI dataset based directly on microscopic features extracted from histology. It uses a combination of computational techniques and manual post-processing to map subfield boundaries from a stack of histology images (obtained with 200 mu m spacing and 5 mu m slice thickness; stained using the Kluver-Barrera method) onto a postmortem 9.4 Tesla MRI scan of the intact, whole hippocampal formation acquired with 160 mu m isotropic resolution. The histology reconstruction procedure consists of sequential application of a graph-theoretic slice stacking algorithm that mitigates the effects of distorted slices, followed by iterative affine and diffeomorphic co-registration to postmortem MRI scans of approximately 1 cm-thick tissue sub-blocks acquired with 200 mu m isotropic resolution.

We explored the neural mechanisms underlying these chronotype differences by comparing the neural response to reward in morning- and evening-types. Using a monetary reward fMRI paradigm, we compared the neural response to reward in 13 morning-types and 21 evening-types (all 20 y/o males). Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses focused on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral striatum (VS), comparing the chronotype groups in these ROIs during anticipation and outcome conditions, and adjusting for time of scan. Chronotype groups were also compared on measures of sensation-seeking, substance involvement, and sleep quality. Evening-types reported significantly greater levels of alcohol dependence and worse sleep quality. Furthermore, evening-types showed an altered neural response to reward relative to morning-types, specifically, reduced mPFC reactivity during reward anticipation and increased VS reactivity during win outcome In turn, less activation in he mPFC region in response to reward was associated with greater alcohol consumption, while increased activation in the VS in response to reward was associated with more symptoms of alcohol dependence. Increased reward-related problems among evening-types may be accompanied by altered neural responses to reward. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

255,254,"Neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development of major depressive disorder (MOD) may differ depending on age-of-onset. Our aim was to compare patients who differ in age-of-onset, while controlling for illness duration, and number of depressive episodes. By directly comparing early-(EOD) and late-onset (LOD) patients, we examined whether age-of-onset is associated with changes in the extent or spatial pattern of cortical thickness. Cross-sectional comparison of cortical thickness in EOD vs. LOD. Age-of-onset was determined based on self-report, with EOD defined as onset prior to age 25. Reduced cortical thickness in the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), pre- and postcentral gyrus, and the lingual gyrus were found in EOD compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001). In linear regression models controlling for number of episodes, illness duration, severity, and sex, differences (at p < 0.001) were found between EOD and LOD in the bilateral posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyri, right precuneus, lingual, and fusiform gyri, but not the DLPFC. EOD is associated with greater disturbances in cortical thickness than LOD, even when duration of illness and other factors are controlled.

We hypothesized that adolescents with AN would show similar disturbed reward modulation within the striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex, a region connected to the striatum and involved in reward-guided action selection. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, twenty-two adolescent females (10 restricting-type AN, 12 healthy volunteers) performed a monetary guessing task. Time series data associated with monetary wins and losses within striatal and cingulate regions of interest were subjected to a linear mixed effects analysis. All participants responded more strongly to wins versus losses in limbic and anterior executive striatal territories. However. AN participants exhibited an exaggerated response to losses compared to wins in posterior executive and sensorimotor striatal regions, suggesting altered function in circuitry responsible for coding the affective context of stimuli and action selection based upon these valuations. As AN individuals are particularly sensitive to criticism, failure, and making mistakes, these findings may reflect the neural processes responsible for a bias in those with AN to exaggerate negative consequences.

259,258,"Cytoarchitectonic area 44 of Broca's region in the left inferior frontal gyrus is known to be involved in several functional domains including language, action and music processing. We investigated whether this functional heterogeneity is reflected in distinct modules within cytoarchitectonically defined left area 44 using metaanalytic connectivity-based parcellation (CBP). This method relies on identifying the whole-brain co-activation pattern for each area 44 voxel across a wide range of functional neuroimaging experiments and subsequently grouping the voxels into distinct clusters based on the similarity of their co-activation patterns. This CBP analysis revealed that five separate clusters exist within left area 44. A post-hoc functional characterization and functional connectivity analysis of these five clusters was then performed. The two posterior clusters were primarily associated with action processes, in particular with phonology and overt speech ( posterior-dorsal cluster) and with rhythmic sequencing (posterior-ventral cluster). The three anterior clusters were primarily associated with language and cognition, in particular with working memory (anterior-dorsal cluster), with detection of meaning (anterior-ventral cluster) and with task switching/cognitive control (inferior frontal junction cluster). These five clusters furthermore showed specific and distinct connectivity patterns. The results demonstrate that left area 44 is heterogeneous, thus supporting anatomical data on the molecular architecture of this region, and provide a basis for more specific interpretations of activations localized in area 44.

260,259,"More educated elders are less susceptible to age-related or pathological cognitive changes. We aimed at providing a comprehensive contribution to the neural mechanism underlying this effect thanks to a multimodal approach. Thirty-six healthy elders were selected based on neuropsychological assessments and cerebral amyloid imaging, i.e. as presenting normal cognition and a negative florbetapir-PET scan. All subjects underwent structural MRI, FDG-PET and resting-state functional MRI scans. We assessed the relationships between years of education and i) gray matter volume, ii) gray matter metabolism and iii) functional connectivity in the brain areas showing associations with both volume and metabolism. Higher years of education were related to greater volume in the superior temporal gyrus, insula and anterior cingulate cortex and to greater metabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex. The latter thus showed both volume and metabolism increases with education. Seed connectivity analyses based on this region showed that education was positively related to the functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus as well as the inferior frontal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus. Increased connectivity was in turn related with improved cognitive performances. Reinforcement of the connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with distant cortical areas of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes appears as one of the mechanisms underlying education-related reserve in healthy elders.

261,260,"Anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulations (tDCS) are both established techniques to induce cortical excitability changes. Typically, in the human motor system, such cortical modulations are inferred through changes in the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs). However, it is now possible to directly evaluate tDCS-induced changes at the cortical level by recording the transcranial magnetic stimulation evoked potentials (TEPs) using electroencephalography (EEG). The present study investigated the modulation induced by the tDCS on the motor system. The study evaluates changes in the MEPs, in the amplitude and distribution of the TEPs, in resting state oscillatory brain activity and in behavioral performance in a simple manual response task. Both the short- and long-term tDCS effects were investigated by evaluating their time course at similar to 0 and 30 min after tDCS. Anodal tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (M1) induced an enhancement of corticospinal excitability, whereas cathodal stimulation produced a reduction. These changes in excitability were indexed by changes in MEP amplitude. More interestingly, tDCS modulated the cortical reactivity, which is the neuronal activity evoked by TMS, in a polarity-dependent and site-specific manner. Cortical reactivity increased after anodal stimulation over the left Ml, whereas it decreased with cathodal stimulation. These effects were partially present also at long term evaluation. No polarity-specific effect was found either on behavioral measures or on oscillatory brain activity. The latter showed a general increase in the power density of low frequency oscillations (theta and alpha) at both stimulation polarities. Our results suggest that tDCS is able to modulate motor cortical reactivity in a polarity-specific manner, inducing a complex pattern of direct and indirect cortical activations or inhibitions of the motor system-related network, which might be related to changes in synaptic efficacy of the motor cortex.

262,261,"Detecting residual consciousness in unresponsive patients is a major clinical concern and a challenge for theoretical neuroscience. To tackle this issue, we recently designed a paradigm that dissociates two electro-encephalographic (EEG) responses to auditory novelty. Whereas a local change in pitch automatically elicits a mismatch negativity (MMN), a change in global sound sequence leads to a late P300b response. The latter component is thought to be present only when subjects consciously perceive the global novelty. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to detect because individual variability is high, especially in clinical recordings. Here, we show that multivariate pattern classifiers can extract subject-specific EEG patterns and predict single-trial local or global novelty responses. We first validate our method with 38 high-density EEG, MEG and intracranial EEG recordings. We empirically demonstrate that our approach circumvents the issues associated with multiple comparisons and individual variability while improving the statistics. Moreover, we confirm in control subjects that local responses are robust to distraction whereas global responses depend on attention. We then investigate 104 vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state (MCS) and conscious state (CS) patients recorded with high-density EEG. For the local response, the proportion of significant decoding scores (M = 60%) does not vary with the state of consciousness. By contrast, for the global response, only 14% of the VS patients' EEG recordings presented a significant effect, compared to 31% in MCS patients' and 52% in CS patients'.

263,262,"Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) has emerged as a promising neuroimaging technique used to identify global hubs of the human brain functional connectome. However, most R-fMRI studies on functional hubs mainly utilize traditional R-fMRI data with relatively low sampling rates (e.g., repetition time [TR] = 2 s). R-fMRI data scanned with higher sampling rates are important for the characterization of reliable functional connectomes because they can provide temporally complementary information about functional integration among brain regions and simultaneously reduce the effects of high frequency physiological noise. Here, we employed a publicly available multiband R-fMRI dataset with a sub-second sampling rate (TR = 645 ms) to identify global hubs in the human voxel-wise functional networks, and further examined their test-retest (TRT) reliability over scanning time. We showed that the functional hubs of human brain networks were mainly located at the default-mode regions (e.g., medial prefrontal and parietal cortex as well as the lateral parietal and temporal cortex) and the sensorimotor and visual cortex. These hub regions were highly anatomically distance-dependent, where short-range and long-range hubs were primarily located at the primary cortex and the multimodal association cortex, respectively. We found that most functional hubs exhibited fair to good TRT reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients. Interestingly, our analysis suggested that a 6-minute scan duration was able to reliably detect these functional hubs. Further comparison analysis revealed that these results were approximately consistent with those obtained using traditional R-fMRI scans of the same subjects with TR = 2500 ms, but several regions (e.g., lateral frontal cortex, paracentral lobule and anterior temporal lobe) exhibited different TRT reliability. Finally, we showed that several regions (including the medial/lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal cortex) were identified as brain hubs in a high frequency band (02-03 Hz), which is beyond the frequency scope of traditional R-fMRI scans.

266,265,"Recent advances in social neuroscience research have unveiled the neurophysiological correlates of race and intergroup processing. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying intergroup empathy. Combining event-related fMRI with measurements of pupil dilation as an index of autonomic reactivity, we explored how race and group membership affect empathy-related responses. White and Black subjects were presented with video clips depicting white, black, and unfamiliar violet-skinned hands being either painfully penetrated by a syringe or being touched by a Q-tip. Both hemodynamic activity within areas known to be involved in the processing of first and third-person emotional experiences of pain, i.e., bilateral anterior insula, and autonomic reactivity were greater for the pain experienced by own-race compared to that of other-race and violet models. Interestingly, greater implicit racial bias predicted increased activity within the left anterior insula during the observation of own-race pain relative to other-race pain. Our findings highlight the close link between group-based segregation and empathic processing. Moreover, they demonstrate the relative influence of culturally acquired implicit attitudes and perceived similarity/familiarity with the target in shaping emotional responses to others' physical pain.

267,266,"A better understanding of how behavioral performance emerges from interacting brain systems may come from analysis of functional networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Recent studies comparing such networks with human behavior have begun to identify these relationships, but few have used a time scale small enough to relate their findings to variation within a single individual's behavior. In the present experiment we examined the relationship between a psychomotor vigilance task and the interacting default mode and task positive networks. Two time-localized comparative metrics were calculated: difference between the two networks' signals at various time points around each instance of the stimulus (peristimulus times) and correlation within a 12.3-s window centered at each peristimulus time. Correlation between networks was also calculated within entire resting-state functional imaging runs from the same individuals. These metrics were compared with response speed on both an intraindividual and an interindividual basis. In most cases, a greater difference or more anticorrelation between networks was significantly related to faster performance. While interindividual analysis showed this result generally, using intraindividual analysis it was isolated to peristimulus times 4 to 8 s before the detected target. Within that peristimulus time span, the effect was stronger for individuals who tended to have faster response times. These results suggest that the relationship between functional networks and behavior can be better understood by using shorter time windows and also by considering both intraindividual and interindividual variability.

268,267,"This article describes a novel approach to extract cortical morphological abnormality patterns from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to improve the prediction accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Conventional approaches extract cortical morphological information, such as regional mean cortical thickness and regional cortical volumes, independently at different regions of interest (ROIs) without considering the relationship between these regions. Our approach involves constructing a similarity map where every element in the map represents the correlation of regional mean cortical thickness between a pair of ROIs. We will demonstrate in this article that this correlative morphological information gives significant improvement in classification performance when compared with ROI-based morphological information. Classification performance is further improved by integrating the correlative information with ROI-based information via multi-kernel support vector machines. This integrated framework achieves an accuracy of 92.35% for AD classification with an area of 0.9744 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and an accuracy of 83.75% for MCI classification with an area of 0.9233. In differentiating MCI subjects who converted to AD within 36 months from non-converters, an accuracy of 75.05% with an area of 0.8426 under ROC curve was achieved, indicating excellent diagnostic power and generalizability. The current work provides an alternative approach to extraction of high-order cortical information from structural MRI data for prediction of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

269,268,"Obesity depends on homeostatic and heclonic foocl intake behavior, mediated by brain plasticity changes in cortical and subcortical structures. The aim of this study was to investigate cortical thickness and subcortical volumes of regions related to food intake behavior in a healthy young adult sample with obesity. Thirty-seven volunteers, 19 with obesity (age=33.7 +/- 5.7 (20-39) years body-mass index (BMI)=36.08 +/- 5.92 (30.10-49.69) kg/m(2)) and 18 controls (age=32.3 +/- 5.9 (21-40) years; BMI=22.5 +/- 1.94 (19.53-2497) kg/m(2)) participated in the study. Patients with neuropsychiatric or biomedical disorders were excluded. We used FreeSurfer software to analyze structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) and obtain global brain measures, cortical thickness and subcortical volume estimations. Finally, correlation analyses were performed for brain structure data and obesity measures. There were no between group differences in age, gender, intelligence or education. Results showed cortical thickness reductions in obesity in the left superior frontal and right medial orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, the obesity group had lower ventral diencephalon and brainstem volumes than controls, while there were no differences in any other subcortical structure. There were no statistically significant correlations between brain structure and obesity measures. Overall, our work provides evidence of the structural brain characteristics associated with metabolically normal obesity. We found reductions in cortical thickness, ventral diencephalon and brainstern volumes in areas that have been implicated in food intake behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

271,270,"Does breastfeeding alter early brain development? The prevailing consensus from large epidemiological studies posits that early exclusive breastfeeding is associated with improved measures of IQ and cognitive functioning in later childhood and adolescence. Prior morphometric brain imaging studies support these findings, revealing increased white matter and sub-cortical gray matter volume, and parietal lobe cortical thickness, associated with IQ in adolescents who were breastfed as infants compared to those who were exclusively formula-fed. Yet it remains unknown when these structural differences first manifest and when developmental differences that predict later performance improvements can be detected. In this study, we used quiet magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to compare measures of white matter microstructure (mcDESPOT measures of myelin water fraction) in 133 healthy children from 10 months through 4 years of age, who were either exclusively breastfed a minimum of 3 months; exclusively formula-fed; or received a mixture of breast milk and formula. We also examined the relationship between breastfeeding duration and white matter microstructure. Breastfed children exhibited increased white matter development in later maturing frontal and association brain regions. Positive relationships between white matter microstructure and breastfeeding duration are also exhibited in several brain regions, that are anatomically consistent with observed improvements in cognitive and behavioral performance measures. While the mechanisms underlying these structural differences remains unclear, our findings provide new insight into the earliest developmental advantages associated with breastfeeding, and support the hypothesis that breast milk constituents promote healthy neural growth and white matter development.

272,271,"While significant differences in male and female brain structures have commonly been reported, only a few studies have focused on the sex differences in the way the cortex matures over time. Here, we investigated cortical thickness maturation between the age of 6 to 30 years, using 209 longitudinally-acquired brain MRI scans. Significant sex differences in the trajectories of cortical thickness change with age were evidenced using non-linear mixed effects models. Similar statistical analyses were computed to quantify the differences between cortical gyrification changes with age in males and females. During adolescence, we observed a statistically significant higher rate of cortical thinning in females compared to males in the right temporal regions, the left temporoparietal junction and the left orbitofrontal cortex. This finding is interpreted as a faster maturation of the social brain areas in females. Concomitantly, statistically significant sex differences in cortical folding changes with age were observed only in one cluster of the right prefrontal regions, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying cortical thickness and gyrification changes with age are quite distinct. Sexual dimorphism in the developmental course of the cortical maturation may be associated with the different age of onset and clinical presentation of many psychiatric disorders between males and females.

274,273,"Objective: Lesion-based mapping of speech pathways has been possible only during invasive neurosurgical procedures using direct cortical stimulation (DCS). However, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) may allow for lesion-based interrogation of language pathways noninvasively. Although not lesion-based, magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) is another noninvasive modality for language mapping. In this study, we compare the accuracy of nTMS and MEGI with DCS. Methods: Subjects with lesions around cortical language areas underwent preoperative nTMS and MEGI for language mapping. nTMS maps were generated using a repetitive TMS protocol to deliver trains of stimulations during a picture naming task. MEGI activation maps were derived from adaptive spatial filtering of beta-band power decreases prior to overt speech during picture naming and verb generation tasks. The subjects subsequently underwent awake language mapping via intraoperative DCS. The language maps obtained from each of the 3 modalities were recorded and compared. Results: nTMS and MEGI were performed on 12 subjects. nTMS yielded 21 positive language disruption sites (11 speech arrest, 5 anomia, and 5 other) while DCS yielded 10 positive sites (2 speech arrest, 5 anomia, and 3 other). MEGI isolated 32 sites of peak activation with language tasks. Positive language sites were most commonly found in the pars opercularis for all three modalities. In 9 instances the positive DCS site corresponded to a positive nTMS site, while in 1 instance it did not. In 4 instances, a positive nTMS site corresponded to a negative DCS site, while 169 instances of negative nTMS and DCS were recorded. The sensitivity of nTMS was therefore 90%, specificity was 98%, the positive predictive value was 69% and the negative predictive value was 99% as compared with intraoperative DCS. MEGI language sites for verb generation and object naming correlated with nTMS sites in 5 subjects, and with DCS sites in 2 subjects. Conclusion: Maps of language function generated with nTMS correlate well with those generated by DCS. Negative nTMS mapping also correlates with negative DCS mapping. In our study, MEGI lacks the same level of correlation with intraoperative mapping; nevertheless it provides useful adjunct information in some cases. nTMS may offer a lesion-based method for noninvasively interrogating language pathways and be valuable in managing patients with pen-eloquent lesions.

277,276,"Objectives: Recent anatomical-functional studies have transformed our understanding of cerebral motor control away from a hierarchical structure and toward parallel and interconnected specialized circuits. Subcortical electrical stimulation during awake surgery provides a unique opportunity to identify white matter tracts involved in motor control. For the first time, this study reports the findings on motor modulatory responses evoked by subcortical stimulation and investigates the cortico-subcortical connectivity of cerebral motor control. Experimental design: Twenty-one selected patients were operated while awake for frontal, insular, and parietal diffuse low-grade gliomas. Subcortical electrostimulation mapping was used to search for interference with voluntary movements. The corresponding stimulation sites were localized on brain schemas using the anterior and posterior commissures method. Principal observations: Subcortical negative motor responses were evoked in 20/21 patients, whereas acceleration of voluntary movements and positive motor responses were observed in three and five patients, respectively. The majority of the stimulation sites were detected rostral of the corticospinal tract near the vertical anterior-commissural line, and additional sites were seen in the frontal and parietal white matter. Conclusions: The diverse interferences with motor function resulting in inhibition and acceleration imply a modulatory influence of the detected fiber network.

278,277,"Obesity is a major health problem in modern societies. It has been related to abnormal functional organization of brain networks believed to process homeostatic (internal) and/or salience (external) information. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis to delineate possible functional changes in brain networks related to obesity. A group of 18 healthy adult participants with obesity were compared with a group of 16 lean participants while performing a resting-state task, with the data being evaluated by independent component analysis. Participants also completed a neuropsychological assessment. Results showed that the functional connectivity strength of the putamen nucleus in the salience network was increased in the obese group. We speculate that this abnormal activation may contribute to overeating through an imbalance between autonomic processing and reward processing of food stimuli. A correlation was also observed in obesity between activation of the putamen nucleus in the salience network and mental slowness, which is consistent with the notion that basal ganglia circuits modulate rapid processing of information.

279,278,"The basal ganglia have traditionally been viewed as motor processing nuclei; however, functional neuroimaging evidence has implicated these structures in more complex cognitive and affective processes that are fundamental for a range of human activities. Using quantitative meta-analysis methods we assessed the functional subdivisions of basal ganglia nuclei in relation to motor (body and eye movements), cognitive (working-memory and executive), affective (emotion and reward) and somatosensory functions in healthy participants. We document affective processes in the anterior parts of the caudate head with the most overlap within the left hemisphere. Cognitive processes showed the most widespread response, whereas motor processes occupied more central structures. On the basis of these demonstrated functional roles of the basal ganglia, we provide a new comprehensive topographical model of these nuclei and insight into how they are linked to a wide range of behaviors.

Current methods for predicting the brain regions influenced by TMS involve projecting the TMS coil position or center of gravity onto realistic head models derived from structural and functional imaging data. Similarly, spherical models have been used to estimate electric field distributions generated by TMS pulses delivered from a particular coil location and position. In the present paper we inspect differences between electric field computations estimated using the finite element method (FEM) and projection-based approaches described above. We then more specifically examined an approach for estimating cortical excitation volumes based on individualistic FEM simulations of electric fields. We evaluated this approach by performing neurophysiological recordings during MR-navigated motormapping experiments. We recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to single pulse TMS using two different coil orientations (45 degrees and 90 degrees to midline) at 25 different locations (5 x 5 grid, 1 cm spacing) centered on the hotspot of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in left motor cortex. We observed that motor excitability maps varied within and between subjects as a function of TMS coil position and orientation. For each coil position and orientation tested, simulations of the TMS-induced electric field were computed using individualistic FEM models and compared to MEP amplitudes obtained during our motormapping experiments. We found FEM simulations of electric field strength, which take into account subject-specific gyral geometry and tissue conductivity anisotropy, significantly correlated with physiologically observed MEP amplitudes (r(max) = 0.91, p = 1.8 x 10(-5) r(mean) = 0.81, p = 0.01).

No functional imaging study has attempted to separate brain regions altered in apathy from those altered in depression in a clinical population. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disorder in which apathy and depression co-exist in a single population. We evaluate the relationship between apathy, depression, and motor severity of disease in PD, focusing on the relationship between these factors and the amplitude of the low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the resting state. We first evaluated if the resting ALFF signal is a reliable measure for our clinical question. For this, we develop and introduce a cross validation approach we term the ""Regional Mapping of Reliable Differences"" (RMRD) method to evaluate reliability of regions of interest deemed ""significant"" by standard voxel-wise techniques. Using this approach, we show that the apathy score in this sample is best predicted by ALFF signal in the left supplementary motor cortex, the right orbitofrontal cortex, and the right middle frontal cortex, whereas depression score is best predicted by ALFF signal in the right subgenual cingulate. Disease severity was best predicted by ALFF signal in the right putamen. A number of additional regions are also statistically (but not reliably) correlated with our neuropsychological measures and disease severity. Our results support the use of resting fMRI as a means to evaluate neuropsychiatric states and motor disease progression in Parkinson disease, and the clinical and epidemiologic observation that apathy and depression are distinct pathological entities.

283,282,"Most prior studies of the effects of excessive alcohol intake on the adolescent brain examined alcohol-use-dependent samples with comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders. In the Cape Town region, we identified a sizeable cohort of adolescents with alcohol use disorders (AUD) without externalizing or other psychiatric disorders. We examined brain morphology in 64 such adolescents compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed using FSL's FIRST software for subcortical volumes, and cortical gray matter (GM) was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and regions of interest (ROI) analysis. AUD boys had smaller thalamic and putamen volumes compared to non-drinking boys, while AUD girls had larger thalamic and putamen volumes compared to non drinking girls. VBM revealed a large region of decreased GM density in AUDs compared to controls located in the left lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, extending medially deep into the parietal lobe. Smaller GM volume in this region was also present when examined using ROI analysis. Our lack of findings in other brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, suggests that reports of smaller brain volumes in adolescent AUDs in the literature are a consequence of psychiatric and substance abuse comorbidities.

284,283,"Therapy for combat and accident-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been reported to influence amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) response during emotional processing. It is not yet understood how therapy influences different phases of emotional processing, and whether previous findings generalize to other PTSD populations. We hypothesized that cognitive trauma therapy for battered women (CTT-BW) would alter insula, amygdala, and cingulate responses during anticipation and presentation of emotional images. Fourteen female patients with PTSD related to domestic violence completed the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after CTT-BW. The fMRI task involved cued anticipation followed by presentation of positive versus negative affective images. CTT-BW was associated with decreases in CAPS score, enhanced ACC and decreased anterior insula activation during anticipation, and decreased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala response during image presentation (negative-positive). Pre-treatment ACC activation during anticipation and image presentation exhibited positive and negative relationships to treatment response, respectively. Results suggest that CTT-BW enhanced efficiency of neural responses during preparation for upcoming emotional events in a way that reduced the need to recruit prefrontal-amygdala responses during the occurrence of the event. Results also suggest that enhancing ACC function during anticipation may be beneficial for PTSD treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This activity is non-stationary and its dynamics reveal highly structured patterns across several spatial scales, from fine-grained functional architecture in sensory cortices to large-scale networks. The mechanistic function of this activity is only poorly understood. The central goal of the current review is to provide an integrated summary of recent studies on structure, dynamics and behavioral consequences of spontaneous brain activity. In light of these empirical observations we propose that the structure of ongoing activity and its itinerant nature can be understood as an indispensible memory system modeling the statistical structure of the world. We review the dynamic properties of ongoing activity, and how they are malleable over short to long temporal scales that permit adapting over a range of short- to long-term cognitive challenges.

To date, no studies have found GM atrophy in bulimia nervosa (BN) or have directly compared patients with AN and BN. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to characterize brain abnormalities in AN and BN patients, comparing them with each other and with a control group, and correlating brain volume with clinical features. We recruited 17 AN, 13 BN and 14 healthy controls. All subjects underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a T1-weighted 3D image. VBM analysis was carried out with the FSL-VBM 4.1 tool. We found no global atrophy, but regional GM reduction in AN with respect to controls and BN in the cerebellum, fusiform area, supplementary motor area, and occipital cortex, and in the caudate in BN compared to AN and controls. Both groups of patients had a volumetric increase bilaterally in somatosensory regions with respect to controls, in areas that are typically involved in the sensory-motor integration of body stimuli and in mental representation of the body image. Our VBM study documented, for the first time in BN patients, the presence of volumetric alterations and replicated previous findings in AN patients. We evidenced morphological differences between AN and BN, demonstrating in the latter atrophy of the caudate nucleus, a region involved in reward mechanisms and processes of self-regulation, perhaps involved in the genesis of the binge-eating behaviors of this disorder.

Inclusion of higher order terms enables the reconstruction of the true average propagator whose projection onto the unit ""displacement"" sphere provides an orientational distribution function (ODF) that contains only the orientational dependence of the diffusion process. The representation characterizes novel features of diffusion anisotropy and the non-Gaussian character of the three-dimensional diffusion process. Other important measures this representation provides include the return-to-the-origin probability (RTOP), and its variants for diffusion in one- and two-dimensions-the return-to-the-plane probability (RTPP), and the return-to-the-axis probability (RTAP), respectively. These zero net displacement probabilities measure the mean compartment (pore) volume and cross-sectional area in distributions of isolated pores irrespective of the pore shape.

Other important measures this representation provides include the return-to-the-origin probability (RTOP), and its variants for diffusion in one- and two-dimensions-the return-to-the-plane probability (RTPP), and the return-to-the-axis probability (RTAP), respectively. These zero net displacement probabilities measure the mean compartment (pore) volume and cross-sectional area in distributions of isolated pores irrespective of the pore shape. MAP-MRI represents a new comprehensive framework to model the three-dimensional q-space signal and transform it into diffusion propagators. Experiments on an excised marmoset brain specimen demonstrate that MAP-MRI provides several novel, quantifiable parameters that capture previously obscured intrinsic features of nervous tissue microstructure. This should prove helpful for investigating the functional organization of normal and pathologic nervous tissue. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

293,292,"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most frequent form of focal epilepsy. At rest, there is evidence that brain abnormalities in MTLE are not limited to the epileptogenic region, but extend throughout the whole brain. It is also well established that MTLE patients suffer from episodic memory deficits. Thus, we investigated the relation between the functional connectivity seen at rest in fMRI and episodic memory impairments in MTLE. We focused on resting state BOLD activity and evaluated whether functional connectivity (FC) differences emerge from MTL seeds in left and right MTLE groups, compared with healthy controls. Results revealed significant FC reductions in both patient groups, localized in angular gyri, thalami, posterior cingulum and medial frontal cortex. We found that the FC between the left non-pathologic MTL and the medial frontal cortex was positively correlated with the delayed recall score of a non-verbal memory test in right MTLE patients, suggesting potential adaptive changes to preserve this memory function. In contrast, we observed a negative correlation between a verbal memory test and the FC between the left pathologic MTL and posterior cingulum in left MTLE patients, suggesting potential functional maladaptative changes in the pathologic hemisphere. Overall, the present study provides some indication that left MTLE may be more impairing than right MTLE patients to normative functional connectivity. Our data also indicates that the pattern of extra-temporal FC may vary as a function of episodic memory material and each hemisphere's capacity for cognitive reorganization.

The validity of these techniques can be assessed by evaluating test-retest reliability, interscanner reliability, and consistency with manual segmentation. We evaluate these measures for the FSL/FIRST subcortical segmentation tool. We retrospectively analyzed 190 MRI scans from 87 subjects with mood or anxiety disorders and healthy volunteers scanned multiple times on different platforms (N = 56) and/or the same platform (N = 45, groups overlap), and 146 scans from subjects who underwent both high-resolution and whole brain imaging in a single session, for comparison with manual segmentation of the hippocampus. The thalamus, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, and pallidum were reliably segmented in different sessions on the same scanner (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.83 scanners and diagnostic groups pooled). In these regions, the range of between platform reliabilities were lower (0.527 < ICC < 0.953), although values below 0.7 were due to systematic differences between platforms or low reliability in the hippocampus between eight- and single-channel coil platforms. Accumbens and amygdala segmentations were generally unreliable within and between scanning platforms. ICC values for hippocampal volumes between automated and manual segmentations were acceptable (ICC > 0.7, groups pooled), and both methods detected significant differences between genders. In addition, FIRST segmentations were consistent with manual segmentations (in a subset of images; N = 20) in the left caudate and bilateral putamen. This retrospective analysis assesses realistic performance of the algorithm in conditions like those found in multisite trials or meta-analyses.

296,295,"Measuring iron content in the brain has important implications for a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), derived from magnetic resonance images, has been used to measure total iron content in vivo and in post mortem brain. In this paper, we show how magnetic susceptibility from QSM correlates with total iron content measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging and by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The relationship between susceptibility and ferritin iron was estimated at 1.10 +/- 0.08 ppb susceptibility per mu g iron/g wet tissue, similar to that of iron in fixed (frozen/thawed) cadaveric brain and previously published data from unfixed brains. We conclude that magnetic susceptibility can provide a direct and reliable quantitative measurement of iron content and that it can be used clinically at least in regions with high iron content.

Using quantitative meta-analytic methods the laterality of: (1) emotional processing; (2) stimulus valence (positive vs. negative); (3) perception vs. experience of emotion; and (4) sex-differences were assessed using the data from 143 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Activation in response to all emotional stimuli occurred in bilateral anterior and mid-insula, and the left posterior insula. Positive emotional stimuli were associated with activation in the left anterior and mid-insula, while negative emotional stimuli activated bilateral anterior and mid-insula. Activation in response to the perception and experience of emotions was highest in bilateral anterior insula, and within the mid and posterior insula it was left lateralized. In males, emotional stimuli predominantly activated the left anterior/mid-insula and right posterior insula, whereas females activated bilateral anterior insula and the left mid and posterior insula. Spatial distinctions observed in emotional processing and its subcategories can provide a comprehensive account of the role of the insular cortices in affect processing, which could aid in understanding deficits seen in psychiatric or developmental disorders.

For neuroimaging researchers, the searchlight technique serves as the most intuitively appealing means of implementing MVPA with fMRI data. However, searchlight approaches carry with them a number of special concerns and limitations that can lead to serious interpretation errors in practice, such as misidentifying a cluster as informative, or failing to detect truly informative voxels. Here we describe how such distorted results can occur, using both schematic illustrations and examples from actual fMRI datasets. We recommend that confirmatory and sensitivity tests, such as the ones prescribed here, should be considered a necessary stage of searchlight analysis interpretation, and that their adoption will allow the full potential of searchlight analysis to be realized.

Cognitive remediation studies indicate that targeted cognitive and/or social-cognitive training improves behavioral performance on trained skills. However, the neural effects of training in schizophrenia and their relation to behavioral gains are largely unknown. This study tested whether a 50-h intervention which included both cognitive and social-cognitive training would influence neural mechanisms that support social ccognition. Schizophrenia participants completed a computer-based intervention of either auditory-based cognitive training (AT) plus social-cognition training (SCT) (N=11) or non-specific computer games (CG) (N=11). Assessments included a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of facial emotion recognition, and behavioral measures of cognition, social cognition, and functional outcome. The fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy, surprise and fear: relative to CG participants, AT+SCT participants showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala, right putamen and right medial prefrontal cortex. Across all participants, pre-to-post intervention neural activity increase in these regions predicted behavioral improvement on an independent emotion perception measure (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Among AT+SCT participants alone, neural activity increase in right amygdala predicted behavioral improvement in emotion perception. The findings indicate that combined cognition and social-cognition training improves neural systems that support social-cognition skills. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In addition, study of the NMR relaxation properties of this signal has indicated contributions from compartmentalized water environments inside and outside the myelin sheath that may be separable. Here we further investigated the effects of water compartmentalization on the MRI signal with the goal of extracting compartment-specific information. By comparing MRI measurements of human and marmoset brain at 7 T with magnetic field modeling, we show that: (1) water between the myelin lipid bilayers, in the axonal, and in the interstitial space each experience characteristic magnetic field effects that depend on fiber orientation (2) these field effects result in characteristic relaxation properties and frequency shifts for these compartments; and (3) compartmental contributions may be separated by multi-component fitting of the MRI signal relaxation (i.e. decay) curve. We further show the potential application of these findings to the direct mapping of myelin content and assessment of WM fiber integrity with high field MRI.

304,303,"Interoception is theorized to be an important process mediating substance use disorders, and the insular cortex is recognized as a core neural region supporting interoception. The purpose of this study was to compare the integration of the insular cortex into prefrontal-related resting-state networks between individuals with cocaine dependence and healthy controls. Participants comprised 41 patients with cocaine dependence and 19 controls who underwent a resting-state 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Individuals with cocaine dependence demonstrated altered functional connectivity of the insular cortex, predominantly the right insular cortex, with all eight prefrontal-related resting-state networks identified through Independent Component Analysis (ICA). A conjunction analysis demonstrated that the right insular cortex was the neural region with the highest number of common group differences across the networks. There was no evidence that insular cortex connectivity commonly differed between groups for non-prefrontal-related networks. Further, seed-based functional connectivity analyses extended the network analyses and indicated that cocaine dependence was associated with greater connectivity of the right insula with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyms, and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These data support the hypothesis that cocaine dependence is related to altered functional interactions of the insular cortex with prefrontal networks. The results suggest possible neural mechanisms by which the insular cortex and interoceptive information influence cognitive control and decision-making processes presumably mediated by prefrontal networks in the cocaine dependence process.

Here, we investigated the role of sleep and sleep deprivation on the consolidation of fear memories and underlying neuronal mechanisms. We employed a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm either followed by a night of polysomnographically monitored sleep, or wakefulness in forty healthy participants. Recall of learned fear was better after sleep, as indicated by stronger explicitly perceived anxiety and autonomous nervous responses. These effects were positively correlated with the preceding time spent in REM sleep and paralleled by activation of the basolateral amygdala. These findings suggest REM sleep-associated consolidation of fear memory in the human amygdala. In view of the critical participation of fear learning mechanisms in the etiology of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, deprivation of REM sleep after exposure to distressing events is an interesting target for further investigation.

To investigate this hypothesis, we utilize a functional connectivity measure for fMRI that can estimate connectivity differences at the voxel level. Applying this method to whole-brain data from two experiments, we provide the first direct evidence that anterior and posterior PPA exhibit distinct connectivity patterns, with anterior PPA more strongly connected to regions in the default mode network (including the parieto-medial temporal pathway) and posterior PPA more strongly connected to occipital visual regions. We show that object sensitivity in PPA also has an anterior-posterior gradient, with stronger responses to abstract objects in posterior PPA. These findings cast doubt on the traditional view of PPA as a single coherent region, and suggest that PPA is composed of one subregion specialized for the processing of low-level visual features and object shape, and a separate subregion more involved in memory and scene context.

Recent evidence suggests an additional central component within trigeminal pain-processing in the pathophysiology of TN. Therefore, we aimed to identity specific brain regions possibly associated with the development or maintenance of TN using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Sixty patients with classical TN were compared to 49 healthy controls. Eighteen patients had TN with concomitant constant facial pain, a condition previously described as a predictor of worse treatment outcome. We found gray matter (GM) volume reduction in TN patients compared to healthy controls in the primary somatosensory and orbitofrontal cortices, as well as the in the secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), cerebellum, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. GM volume decrease within the ACC, parahippocampus, and temporal lobe correlated with increasing disease duration in TN. There were no differences comparing patients with and without concomitant constant facial pain. No GM increase was found comparing patient subgroups with each other and with healthy controls. The observed changes probably reflect the impact of multiple, daily attacks of trigeminal pain in these patients similar to what was previously described in other chronic pain conditions and may be interpreted as adaptation mechanism to chronic pain in regard to neuronal plasticity. The ACC, parahippocampus and temporal lobe volume reduction in parallel with disease duration may point to a pivotal role of these structures in chronic pain. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Significant progress in dissecting neural connections has been made using optical imaging with fluorescence labels, especially in dissecting local connections. However, acquiring and tracing brain-wide, long-distance neural circuits at the neurite level remains a substantial challenge. Here, we describe a whole-brain approach to systematically obtaining continuous neuronal pathways in a fluorescent protein transgenic mouse at a one-micron voxel resolution. This goal is achieved by combining a novel resin-embedding method for maintaining fluorescence, an automated fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography system for long-term stable imaging, and a digital reconstruction-registration-annotation pipeline for tracing the axonal pathways in the mouse brain. With the unprecedented ability to image a whole mouse brain at a one-micron voxel resolution, the long-distance pathways were traced minutely and without interruption for the first time. With advancing labeling techniques, our method is believed to open an avenue to exploring both local and long-distance neural circuits that are related to brain functions and brain diseases down to the neurite level.

Between-group comparisons of RSNs changed when adjusting for GM volume, as follows: (1) there was only marginal effect on the analysis of sensory (i.e., sensorimotor, visual, and auditory) networks; and (2) there was a significantly increased difference when cognitive networks (apart from one related to attention) were considered. Compared with women, men experienced increased FC in parietal and occipital regions in most RSNs, whereas women experienced a higher RS FC in frontal and temporal regions, and in the cerebellum. When compared to women, increased FNC was found in men between several cognitive and sensory networks, whereas women showed an increased FNC only between attention and right working-memory networks. Conclusions: The organization of intrinsic FC and FNC differ between genders.

311,310,"Despite the general acceptance that functional specialization plays an important role in brain function, there is little consensus about its extent in the brain. We sought to advance the understanding of this question by employing a data-driven approach that capitalizes on the existence of large databases of neuroimaging data. We quantified the diversity of activation in brain regions as a way to characterize the degree of functional specialization. To do so, brain activations were classified in terms of task domains, such as vision, attention, and language, which determined a region's functional fingerprint. We found that the degree of diversity varied considerably across the brain. We also quantified novel properties of regions and of networks that inform our understanding of several task-positive and task-negative networks described in the literature, including defining functional fingerprints for entire networks and measuring their functional assortativity, namely the degree to which they are composed of regions with similar functional fingerprints. Our results demonstrate that some brain networks exhibit strong assortativity, whereas other networks consist of relatively heterogeneous parts. In sum, rather than characterizing the contributions of individual brain regions using task-based functional attributions, we instead quantified their dispositional tendencies, and related those to each region's affiliative properties in both task-positive and task-negative contexts.

312,311,"Metacognition, the ability to monitor one's own cognitive processes, is frequently assumed to be univocally associated with conscious processing. However, some monitoring processes, such as those associated with the evaluation of one's own performance, may conceivably be sufficiently automatized to be deployed non-consciously. Here, we used simultaneous electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG/MEG) to investigate how error detection is modulated by perceptual awareness of a masked target digit. The Error-Related Negativity (ERN), an EEG component occurring similar to 100 ms after an erroneous response, was exclusively observed on conscious trials: regardless of masking strength, the amplitude of the ERN showed a step-like increase when the stimulus became visible. Nevertheless, even in the absence of an ERN, participants still managed to detect their errors at above-chance levels under subliminal conditions. Error detection on conscious trials originated from the posterior cingulate cortex, while a small response to non-conscious errors was seen in dorsal anterior cingulate. We propose the existence of two distinct brain mechanisms for metacognitive judgements: a conscious all-or-none process of single-trial response evaluation, and a non-conscious statistical assessment of confidence.

313,312,"Fluid intelligence represents the capacity for flexible problem solving and rapid behavioral adaptation. Rewards drive flexible behavioral adaptation, in part via a teaching signal expressed as reward prediction errors in the ventral striatum, which has been associated with phasic dopamine release in animal studies. We examined a sample of 28 healthy male adults using multimodal imaging and biological parametric mapping with (1) functional magnetic resonance imaging during a reversal learning task and (2) in a subsample of 17 subjects also with positron emission tomography using 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA to assess dopamine synthesis capacity. Fluid intelligence was measured using a battery of nine standard neuropsychological tests. Ventral striatal BOLD correlates of reward prediction errors were positively correlated with fluid intelligence and, in the right ventral striatum, also inversely correlated with dopamine synthesis capacity (FDOPA Kinapp). When exploring aspects of fluid intelligence, we observed that prediction error signaling correlates with complex attention and reasoning. These findings indicate that individual differences in the capacity for flexible problem solving relate to ventral striatal activation during reward-related learning, which in turn proved to be inversely associated with ventral striatal dopamine synthesis capacity.

314,313,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine cognitive regulation of negative emotion in 12 unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 24 controls. The participants used reappraisal to increase (real condition) and reduce (photo condition) the personal relevance of negative and neutral pictures during fMRI as valence ratings were collected; passive viewing (look condition) served as a baseline. Reappraisal was not strongly affected by MDD. Ratings indicated that both groups successfully reappraised negative emotional experience. Both groups also showed better memory for negative vs. neutral pictures 2 weeks later. Across groups, increased brain activation was observed on negative/real vs. negative/look and negative/photo trials in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), rostral anterior cingulate, left parietal cortex, caudate, and right amygdala. Depressive severity was inversely correlated with activation modulation in the left DLPFC, right amygdala, and right cerebellum during negative reappraisal. The lack of group differences suggests that depressed adults can modulate the brain activation and subjective experience elicited by negative pictures when given clear instructions. However, the negative relationship between depression severity and effects of reappraisal on brain activation indicates that group differences may be detectable in larger samples of more severely depressed participants.

315,314,"Multivariate machine learning methods are increasingly used to analyze neuroimaging data, often replacing more traditional ""mass univariate"" techniques that fit data one voxel at a time. In the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature, this has led to broad application of ""off-the-shelf"" classification and regression methods. These generic approaches allow investigators to use ready-made algorithms to accurately decode perceptual, cognitive, or behavioral states from distributed patterns of neural activity. However, when applied to correlated whole-brain fMRI data these methods suffer from coefficient instability, are sensitive to outliers, and yield dense solutions that are hard to interpret without arbitrary thresholding. Here, we develop variants of the Graph-constrained Elastic-Net (GraphNet), a fast, whole-brain regression and classification method developed for spatially and temporally correlated data that automatically yields interpretable coefficient maps (Grosenick et al., 2009b). GraphNet methods yield sparse but structured solutions by combining structured graph constraints (based on knowledge about coefficient smoothness or connectivity) with a global sparsity-inducing prior that automatically selects important variables. Because GraphNet methods can efficiently fit regression or classification models to whole-brain, multiple time-point data sets and enhance classification accuracy relative to volume-of-interest (VOI) approaches, they eliminate the need for inherently biased VOI analyses and allow whole-brain fitting without the multiple comparison problems that plague mass univariate and roaming VOI (""searchlight"") methods. As fMRI data are unlikely to be normally distributed, we (1) extend GraphNet to include robust loss functions that confer insensitivity to outliers, (2) equip them with ""adaptive"" penalties that asymptotically guarantee correct variable selection, and (3) develop a novel sparse structured Support Vector GraphNet classifier (SVGN). When applied to previously published data (Knutson et al., 2007), these efficient whole-brain methods significantly improved classification accuracy over previously reported VOI-based analyses on the same data (Grosenick et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2007) while discovering task-related regions not documented in the original VOI approach. Critically, GraphNet estimates fit to the Knutson et al. (2007) data generalize well to out-of-sample data collected more than three years later on the same task but with different subjects and stimuli (Karmarkar et al., submitted for publication). By enabling robust and efficient selection of important voxels from whole-brain data taken over multiple time points (>100,000 ""features""), these methods enable data-driven selection of brain areas that accurately predict single-trial behavior within and across individuals.

316,315,"Insufficient sleep and poor quality sleep are pervasive during adolescence and relate to impairments in cognitive control and increased risk taking. However, the neurobiology underlying the association between sleep and adolescent behavior remains elusive. In the current study, we examine how poor sleep quality relates to cognitive control and reward related brain function during risk taking. Forty-six adolescents participated in a functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) scan during which they completed a cognitive control and risk taking task. Behaviorally, adolescents who reported poorer sleep also exhibited greater risk-taking. This association was paralleled by less recruitment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during cognitive control, greater insula activation during reward processing, and reduced functional coupling between the DLPFC and affective regions including the insula and ventral striatum during reward processing. Collectively, these results suggest that poor sleep may exaggerate the normative imbalance between affective and cognitive control systems, leading to greater risk-taking in adolescents.

Although it is often assumed that this distributed semantic information is integrated in higher-level heteromodal association cortices, open questions remain about the role and anatomic basis of heteromodal representations in semantic memory. Here we used combined neuroimaging evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize the cortical networks underlying concept representation. Using a lexical decision task, we examined the processing of concepts in four semantic categories that varied on their sensory-motor feature associations (sight, sound, manipulation, and abstract). We found that the angular gyrus was activated across all categories regardless of their modality-specific feature associations, consistent with a heteromodal account for the angular gyrus. Exploratory analyses suggested that categories with weighted sensory-motor features additionally recruited modality-specific association cortices. Furthermore, DTI tractography identified white matter tracts connecting these regions of modality-specific functional activation with the angular gyrus.

318,317,"The human brain is a complex network of anatomically segregated regions interconnected by white matter pathways, known as the human connectome. Diffusion tensor imaging can be used to reconstruct this structural brain network in vivo and noninvasively. However, due to a wide variety of influences, both false positive and false negative connections may occur. By choosing a 'group threshold', brain networks of multiple subjects can be combined into a single reconstruction, affecting the occurrence of these false positives and negatives. In this case, only connections that are detected in a large enough percentage of the subjects, specified by the group threshold, are considered to be present. Although this group threshold has a substantial impact on the resulting reconstruction and subsequent analyses, it is often chosen intuitively. Here, we introduce a model to estimate how the choice of group threshold influences the presence of false positives and negatives. Based on our findings, group thresholds should preferably be chosen between 30% and 90%. Our results further suggest that a group threshold of circa 60% is a suitable setting, providing a good balance between the elimination of false positives and false negatives. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Developmental origins of neurocognitive late-life functions are acknowledged, but detailed longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies of brain maturation and direct comparisons with aging are lacking. To these aims, a novel method was used to measure longitudinal volume changes in development (n=85, 8-22 years) and aging (n=142, 60-91 years). Developmental reductions exceeded 1% annually in much of the cortex, more than double to that seen in aging, with a posterior-to-anterior gradient. Cortical reductions were greater than the subcortical during development, while the opposite held in aging. The pattern of lateral cortical changes was similar across development and aging, but the pronounced medial temporal reduction in aging was not precast in development. Converging patterns of change in adolescents and elderly, particularly in the medial prefrontal areas, suggest that late developed cortices are especially vulnerable to atrophy in aging. A key question in future research will be to disentangle the neurobiological underpinnings for the differences and the similarities between brain changes in development and aging.

322,321,"Theories of schizophrenia propose that abnormal functioning of the neural reward system is linked to negative and psychotic symptoms, by disruption of reward processing and promotion of context-independent false associations. Recently, it has been argued that an insula-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) salience network system enables switching of brain states from the default mode to a task-related activity mode. Abnormal interaction between the insula-ACC system and reward processing regions may help explain abnormal reinforcer processing and symptoms. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neural correlates of reward processing in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we investigated functional connectivity between the dopaminergic midbrain, a key region for the processing of reinforcers, and other brain regions. In response to rewards, controls activated task related regions (striatum, amygdala/hippocampus and midbrain) and the insula-ACC salience network. Patients similarly activated the insula-ACC salience network system but failed to activate task related regions. Reduced functional connectivity between the midbrain and the insula was found in schizophrenia, with the extent of this abnormality correlating with increased psychotic symptoms. The findings support the notion that reward processing is abnormal in schizophrenia and highlight the potential role of abnormal interactions between the insula-ACC salience network and reward regions.

323,322,"Synchronizing movements with auditory beats, compared to visual flashes, yields divergent activation in timing-related brain areas as well as more stable tapping synchronization. The differences in timing-related brain activation could reflect differences in tapping synchronization stability, rather than differences between modality (i.e., audio-motor vs. visuo-motor integration). In the current fMRI study, participants synchronized their finger taps with four types of visual and auditory pacing sequences: flashes and a moving bar, as well as beeps and a frequency-modulated 'siren'. Behavioral tapping results showed that visuo-motor synchronization improved with moving targets, whereas audio-motor synchronization degraded with frequency-modulated sirens. Consequently, a modality difference in synchronization occurred between the discrete beeps and flashes, but not between the novel continuous siren and moving bar. Imaging results showed that activation in the putamen, a key timing area, paralleled the behavioral results: putamen activation was highest for beeps, intermediate for the continuous siren and moving bar, and was lowest for the flashes. Putamen activation differed between modalities for beeps and flashes, but not for the novel moving bar and siren. By dissociating synchronization performance from modality, we show that activation in the basal ganglia is associated with sensorimotor synchronization stability rather than modality-specificity in this task. Synchronization stability is apparently contingent upon the modality's processing affinity: discrete auditory and moving visual signals are modality appropriate, and can be encoded reliably for integration with the motor system.

324,323,"Two lines of evidence indicate that there exists a reciprocal inhibitory relationship between opposed brain networks. First, most attention-demanding cognitive tasks activate a stereotypical set of brain areas, known as the task-positive network and simultaneously deactivate a different set of brain regions, commonly referred to as the task negative or default mode network. Second, functional connectivity analyses show that these same opposed networks are anti-correlated in the resting state. We hypothesize that these reciprocally inhibitory effects reflect two incompatible cognitive modes, each of which may be directed towards understanding the external world. Thus, engaging one mode activates one set of regions and suppresses activity in the other. We test this hypothesis by identifying two types of problem-solving task which, on the basis of prior work, have been consistently associated with the task positive and task negative regions: tasks requiring social cognition, i.e., reasoning about the mental states of other persons, and tasks requiring physical cognition, i.e., reasoning about the causal/mechanical properties of inanimate objects. Social and mechanical reasoning tasks were presented to neurologically normal participants during fMRI. Each task type was presented using both text and video clips. Regardless of presentation modality, we observed clear evidence of reciprocal suppression: social tasks deactivated regions associated with mechanical reasoning and mechanical tasks deactivated regions associated with social reasoning. These findings are not explained by self-referential processes, task engagement, mental simulation, mental time travel or external vs. internal attention, all factors previously hypothesized to explain default mode network activity. Analyses of resting state data revealed a close match between the regions our tasks identified as reciprocally inhibitory and regions of maximal anti-correlation in the resting state. These results indicate the reciprocal inhibition is not attributable to constraints inherent in the tasks, but is neural in origin. Hence, there is a physiological constraint on our ability to simultaneously engage two distinct cognitive modes. Further work is needed to more precisely characterize these opposing cognitive domains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

First, most attention-demanding cognitive tasks activate a stereotypical set of brain areas, known as the task-positive network and simultaneously deactivate a different set of brain regions, commonly referred to as the task negative or default mode network. Second, functional connectivity analyses show that these same opposed networks are anti-correlated in the resting state. We hypothesize that these reciprocally inhibitory effects reflect two incompatible cognitive modes, each of which may be directed towards understanding the external world. Thus, engaging one mode activates one set of regions and suppresses activity in the other. We test this hypothesis by identifying two types of problem-solving task which, on the basis of prior work, have been consistently associated with the task positive and task negative regions: tasks requiring social cognition, i.e., reasoning about the mental states of other persons, and tasks requiring physical cognition, i.e., reasoning about the causal/mechanical properties of inanimate objects. Social and mechanical reasoning tasks were presented to neurologically normal participants during fMRI. Each task type was presented using both text and video clips. Regardless of presentation modality, we observed clear evidence of reciprocal suppression: social tasks deactivated regions associated with mechanical reasoning and mechanical tasks deactivated regions associated with social reasoning. These findings are not explained by self-referential processes, task engagement, mental simulation, mental time travel or external vs. internal attention, all factors previously hypothesized to explain default mode network activity. Analyses of resting state data revealed a close match between the regions our tasks identified as reciprocally inhibitory and regions of maximal anti-correlation in the resting state. These results indicate the reciprocal inhibition is not attributable to constraints inherent in the tasks, but is neural in origin. Hence, there is a physiological constraint on our ability to simultaneously engage two distinct cognitive modes. Further work is needed to more precisely characterize these opposing cognitive domains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

325,324,"Although previous studies have established that successful memory encoding is associated with increased synchronization of theta-band and gamma-band oscillations, it is unclear if there is a functional relationship between oscillations in these frequency bands. Using scalp-recorded EEG in healthy human participants, we demonstrate that cross-frequency coupling between frontal theta phase and posterior gamma power is enhanced during the encoding of visual stimuli which participants later on remember versus items which participants subsequently forget (""subsequent memory effect,"" SME). Conventional wavelet analyses and source localizations revealed SMEs in spectral power of theta-, alpha-, and gamma-band. Successful compared to unsuccessful encoding was reflected in increased theta-band activity in right frontal cortex as well as increased gamma-band activity in parietal-occipital regions. Moreover, decreased alpha-band activity in prefrontal and occipital cortex was also related to successful encoding. Overall, these findings support the idea that during the formation of new memories frontal cortex regions interact with cortical representations in posterior areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

326,325,"Networks of functional connectivity are highly consistent across participants, suggesting that functional connectivity is for a large part predetermined. However, several studies have shown that functional connectivity may change depending on instructions or previous experience. In the present study, we investigated whether 6 weeks of practice with a working memory task changes functional connectivity during a resting period preceding the task. We focused on two task-relevant networks, the frontoparietal network and the default network, using seed regions in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), respectively. After practice, young adults showed increased functional connectivity between the right MFG and other regions of the frontoparietal network, including bilateral superior frontal gyrus, paracingulate gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex. In addition, they showed reduced functional connectivity between the medial PFC and right posterior middle temporal gyrus. Moreover, a regression with performance changes revealed a positive relation between performance increases and changes of frontoparietal connectivity, and a negative relation between performance increases and changes of default network connectivity. Next, to study whether experience-dependent effects would be different during development, we also examined practice effects in a pilot sample of 12-year-old children. No practice effects were found in this group, suggesting that practice-related changes of functional connectivity are age-dependent. Nevertheless, future studies with larger samples are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013.

327,326,"Water diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a powerful tool for studying biological tissue microarchitectures in vivo. Recently, there has been increased effort to develop quantitative dMRI methods to probe both length scale and orientation information in diffusion media. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) is one such approach that aims to resolve such information based on the three-dimensional diffusion propagator at each voxel. However, in practice, only the orientation component of the propagator function is preserved when deriving the orientation distribution function. Here, we demonstrate how a straightforward extension of the linear spherical deconvolution (SD) model can be used to probe tissue orientation structures over a range (or spectrum) of length scales with minimal assumptions on the underlying microarchitecture. Using high b-value Cartesian q-space data on a rat brain tissue sample, we demonstrate how this restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) model allows for separating the volume fraction and orientation distribution of hindered and restricted diffusion, which we argue stems primarily from diffusion in the extraneurite and intraneurite water compartment, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate how empirical RSI estimates of the neurite orientation distribution and volume fraction capture important additional structure not afforded by traditional DSI or fixed-scale SD-like reconstructions, particularly in gray matter. We conclude that incorporating length scale information in geometric models of diffusion offers promise for advancing state-of-the-art dMRI methods beyond white matter into gray matter structures while allowing more detailed quantitative characterization of water compartmentalization and histoarchitecture of healthy and diseased tissue.

328,327,"The EEG/MEG signal is generated primarily by the summation of the post-synaptic potentials of cortical principal cells. At a microcircuit level, these glutamatergic principal cells are reciprocally connected to GABAergic interneurons and cortical oscillations are thought to be dependent on the balance of excitation and inhibition between these cell types. To investigate the dependence of movement-related cortical oscillations on excitation-inhibition balance, we pharmacologically manipulated the GABA system using tiagabine, which blocks GABA Transporter 1 (GAT-1), the GABA uptake transporter and increases endogenous GABA activity. In a blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design, in 15 healthy participants we administered either 15 mg of tiagabine or a placebo. We recorded whole-head magnetoencephalograms, while the participants performed a movement task, prior to, one hour post, three hour post and five hour post tiagabine ingestion. Using time-frequency analysis of beamformer source reconstructions, we quantified the baseline level of beta activity (15-30 Hz), the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR), beta event-related desynchronisation (beta-ERD) and movement-related gamma synchronisation (MRGS) (60-90 Hz). Our results demonstrated that tiagabine, and hence elevated endogenous GABA levels causes, an elevation of baseline beta power, enhanced beta-ERD and reduced PMBR, but no modulation of MRGS. Comparing our results to recent literature (Hall et al., 2011) we suggest that beta-ERD may be a GABA(A) receptor mediated process while PMBR may be GABA(B) receptor mediated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

329,328,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is used clinically for the treatment of depression however outcomes vary greatly between patients. We have shown that average clinical efficacy of different left DLPFC TMS sites is related to intrinsic functional connectivity with remote regions including the subgenual cingulate and suggested that functional connectivity with these remote regions might be used to identify optimized left DLPFC targets for TMS. However it remains unclear if and how this connectivity-based targeting approach should be applied at the single-subject level to potentially individualize therapy to specific patients. In this article we show that individual differences in DLPFC connectivity are large, reproducible across sessions, and can be used to generate individualized DLPFC TMS targets that may prove clinically superior to those selected on the basis of group-average connectivity. Factors likely to improve individualized targeting including the use of seed maps and the focality of stimulation are investigated and discussed. The techniques presented here may be applicable to individualized targeting of focal brain stimulation across a range of diseases and stimulation modalities and can be experimentally tested in clinical trials.

330,329,"Reward neurocircuitry links motivation with complex behavioral responses. Studies of incentive processing have repeatedly demonstrated activation of nucleus accumbens (NAc), thalamus, and anterior insula, three key components of reward neurocircuitry. The contribution of the thalamus to this circuitry in humans has been relatively ignored, a gap that needs to be filled, given the central role of this structure in processing and filtering information. This study aimed to understand how these three regions function as a network during gain or loss anticipation in adults and youth. Towards this goal, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to examine effective connectivity among these three nodes in healthy adults and adolescents who performed the monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Seven connectivity models, based on anatomic connections, were tested. They were estimated for incentive anticipation and underwent Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) to determine the best-fit model for each adult and adolescent group. Connection strengths were extracted from the best-fit model and examined for significance in each group. These variables were then entered into a linear mixed model to test between-group effects on effective connectivity in reward neurocircuitry. The best-fit model for both groups included all possible anatomic connections. Three main findings emerged: (1) Across the task, thalamus and insula significantly influenced NAc; (2) A broader set of significant connections was found for the loss-cue condition than the gain-cue condition in both groups; (3) Finally, between-group comparisons of connectivity strength failed to detect statistical differences, suggesting that adults and adolescents use this incentive-processing network in a similar manner. This study demonstrates the way in which the thalamus and insula influence the NAc during incentive processing in humans. Specifically, this is the first study to demonstrate in humans the key role of thalamus projections onto the NAc in support of reward processing. Our results suggest that anticipation of gain/loss involves an 'alerting' signal (thalamus) that converges with interoceptive information (insula) to shape action selection programs in the ventral striatum.

331,330,"Various neuroimaging measures are being evaluated for tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in therapeutic trials, including measures of structural brain change based on repeated scanning of patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods to compute brain change must be robust to scan quality. Biases may arise if any scans are thrown out, as this can lead to the true changes being overestimated or underestimated. Here we analyzed the full MRI dataset from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) and assessed several sources of bias that can arise when tracking brain changes with structural brain imaging methods, as part of a pipeline for tensor-based morphometry (TBM). In all healthy subjects who completed MRI scanning at screening, 6, 12, and 24 months, brain atrophy was essentially linear with no detectable bias in longitudinal measures. In power analyses for clinical trials based on these change measures, only 39 AD patients and 95 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects were needed for a 24-month trial to detect a 25% reduction in the average rate of change using a two-sided test (alpha=0.05, power=80%). Further sample size reductions were achieved by stratifying the data into Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon 4 carriers versus non-carriers. We show how selective data exclusion affects sample size estimates, motivating an objective comparison of different analysis techniques based on statistical power and robustness.

In this study, the performance of 2D and 3D single-shot pulsed-continuous ASL (pCASL) sequences was assessed in a group of young healthy volunteers undergoing a baseline perfusion and a functional study with a sensory-motor activation paradigm. The evaluated sequences were 2D echo-planar imaging (2D EPI), 3D single-shot fast spin-echo with in-plane spiral readout (3D FSE spiral), and 3D single-shot gradientand-spin-echo (3D GRASE). The 3D sequences were implemented with and without the addition of an optimized background suppression (BS) scheme. Labeling efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and gray matter (GM) to white matter (WM) contrast ratio were assessed in baseline perfusion measurements. 3D acquisitions without BS yielded 2-fold increments in spatial SNR, but no change in temporal SNR. The addition of BS to the 3D sequences yielded a 3-fold temporal SNR increase compared to the unsuppressed sequences. 2D EPI provided better GM-to-WM contrast ratio than the 3D sequences.

Participants were 106 teenagers (46 bingers and 60 controls) aged 16-19 who received a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. FreeSurfer segmented and quantified the volume of each cerebellum. Maximum drinks during a binge in the past 3 months and duration since last binge were examined as predictors of cerebellar volume, after controlling for potentially confounding variables. In the 106 teens, higher peak drinks predicted smaller left hemisphere cerebellar gray and whitematter, and right hemisphere cerebellar gray matter, and marginally predicted smaller right hemisphere cerebellar white matter. Gender did not moderate these effects. More intense adolescent binge drinking is linked to smaller cerebellar volumes even in healthy teens, above and beyond variability attributable to risk factors for binge drinking. Longitudinal research is needed to see if cerebellar volumes worsen with protracted drinking and recover with abstinence. Interventions aimed at improving brain structure in adolescent binge drinkers are necessary given the high prevalence of risky drinking in youth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

334,333,"Numerous cross-sectional MRI studies have characterized age-related differences in regional brain volumes that differ with structure and tissue type. The extent to which cross-sectional assumptions about change are accurate depictions of actual longitudinal measurement remains controversial. Even longitudinal studies can be limited by the age range of participants, sex distribution of the samples, and scan intervals. To address these issues, we calculated trajectories of regional brain volume changes from T1-weighted (SPGR) MRI data, quantified with our automated, unsupervised SRI24 atlas-based registration and parcellation method. Longitudinal MRIs were acquired at 3 Tin 17 boys and 12 girls, age 10 to 14 years, and 41 men and 41 women, age 20 to 85 years at first scan. Application of a regression-based correction function permitted merging of data acquired at 3 T field strength with data acquired at 1.5 T from additional subjects, thereby expanding the sample to a total of 55 men and 67 women, age 20 to 85 years at first scan. Adjustment for individual supratentorial volume removed regional volume differences between men and women due to sex-related differences in head size. Individual trajectories were computed from data collected on 2 to 6 MRIs at a single field strength over a similar to 1 to 8 year interval. Using linear mixed-effects models, the pattern of trajectories over age indicated: rises in ventricular and Sylvian fissure volumes, with older individuals showing faster increases than younger ones; declines in selective cortical volumes with faster tissue shrinkage in older than younger individuals; little effect of aging on volume of the corpus callosum; more rapid expansion of CSF-filled spaces in men than women after age 60 years; and evidence for continued growth in central white matter through early adulthood with accelerated decline in senescence greater in men than women.

336,335,"Neurofeedback (NFB) involves a brain-computer interface that allows users to learn to voluntarily control their cortical oscillations, reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Although NFB is being pioneered as a noninvasive tool for treating brain disorders, there is insufficient evidence on the mechanism of its impact on brain function. Furthermore, the dominant rhythm of the human brain is the alpha oscillation (8-12 Hz), yet its behavioral significance remains multifaceted and largely correlative. In this study with 34 healthy participants, we examined whether during the performance of an attentional task, the functional connectivity of distinct fMRI networks would be plastically altered after a 30-min session of voluntary reduction of alpha rhythm (n = 17) versus a sham-feedback condition (n = 17). We reveal that compared to sham-feedback, NFB induced an increase of connectivity within regions of the salience network involved in intrinsic alertness (dorsal anterior cingulate), which was detectable 30 min after termination of training. The increase in salience network (default-mode network) connectivity was negatively (positively) correlated with changes in 'on task' mind-wandering as well as resting state alpha rhythm. Crucially, we observed a causal dependence between alpha rhythm synchronization during NFB and its subsequent change at resting state, not exhibited by the SHAM group. Our findings provide neurobehavioral evidence for the brain's exquisite functional plasticity, and for a temporally direct impact of NFB on a key cognitive control network, suggesting a promising basis for its use to treat cognitive disorders under physiological conditions.

337,336,"Granger causality is a method for identifying directed functional connectivity based on time series analysis of precedence and predictability. The method has been applied widely in neuroscience, however its application to functional MRI data has been particularly controversial, largely because of the suspicion that Granger causal inferences might be easily confounded by inter-regional differences in the hemodynamic response function. Here, we show both theoretically and in a range of simulations, that Granger causal inferences are in fact robust to a wide variety of changes in hemodynamic response properties, including notably their time-to-peak. However, when these changes are accompanied by severe downsampling, and/or excessive measurement noise, as is typical for current fMRI data, incorrect inferences can still be drawn. Our results have important implications for the ongoing debate about lag-based analyses of functional connectivity.

338,337,"Advances in neuroimaging techniques have recently provided glimpse into the neurobiology of complex traits of human personality. Whereas some intriguing findings have connected aspects of personality to variations in brain morphology, the relations are complex and our current understanding is incomplete. Therefore, we aimed to provide a comprehensive investigation of brain-personality relations using a multimodal neuroimaging approach in a large sample comprising 265 healthy individuals. The NEO Personality Inventory was used to provide measures of core aspects of human personality, and imaging phenotypes included measures of total and regional brain volumes, regional cortical thickness and arealization, and diffusion tensor imaging indices of white matter (WM) microstructure. Neuroticism was the trait most clearly linked to brain structure. Higher neuroticism including facets reflecting anxiety, depression and vulnerability to stress was associated with smaller total brain volume, widespread decrease in WM microstructure, and smaller frontotemporal surface area. Higher scores on extraversion were associated with thinner inferior frontal gyms, and conscientiousness was negatively associated with arealization of the temporoparietal junction. No reliable associations between brain structure and agreeableness and openness, respectively, were found. The results provide novel evidence of the associations between brain structure and variations in human personality, and corroborate previous findings of a consistent neuroanatomical basis of negative emotionality.

339,338,"Brain research depends strongly on imaging for assessing function and disease in vivo. We examine herein multispectral opto-acoustic tomography (MSOT), a novel technology for high-resolution molecular imaging deep inside tissues. MSOT illuminates tissue with light pulses at multiple wavelengths and detects the acoustic waves generated by the thermoelastic expansion of the environment surrounding absorbing molecules. Using spectral unmixing analysis of the data collected, MSOT can then differentiate the spectral signatures of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and of photo-absorbing agents and quantify their concentration. By being able to detect absorbing molecules up to centimeters deep in the tissue it represents an ideal modality for small animal brain imaging, simultaneously providing anatomical, hemodynamic, functional, and molecular information. In this work we examine the capacity of MSOT in cross-sectional brain imaging of mice. We find unprecedented optical imaging performance in cross-sectional visualization of anatomical and physiological parameters of the mouse brain. For example, the potential of MSOT to characterize ischemic brain areas was demonstrated through the use of a carbon dioxide challenge. In addition, indocyanine green (ICG) was injected intravenously, and the kinetics of uptake and clearance in the vasculature of the brain was visualized in real-time. We further found that multiparameter, multispectral imaging of the growth of U87 tumor cells injected into the brain could be visualized through the intact mouse head, for example through visualization of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the growing tumor. We also demonstrate how MSOT offers several compelling features for brain research and allows time-dependent detection and quantification of brain parameters that are not available using other imaging methods without invasive procedures.

340,339,"Cerebral 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has shown altered auditory pathway activity in tinnitus. However, the corresponding studies involved only small samples and analyses were restricted to the auditory cortex in most studies. Evidence is growing that also limbic, frontal, and parietal areas are involved in the pathophysiology of chronic tinnitus. These regions are considered to mediate perceptual, attentional, and emotional processes. Thus, the aim of the present study was the systematic evaluation of metabolic brain activity in a large sample of tinnitus patients. Ninety one patients with chronic tinnitus underwent FDG-PET. The effects of tinnitus severity (assessed by a tinnitus questionnaire score), duration and laterality were evaluated with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) in whole brain analyses. In addition, region of interest analyses were performed for primary auditory areas. Tinnitus duration correlated positively with brain metabolism in right inferior frontal, right ventro-medial prefrontal, and right posterior cingulate cortex. Tinnitus distress correlated positively with activation of left and right posterior inferior temporal gyrus as well as left and right posterior parahippocampalhippocampal interface. Region of interest analysis demonstrated an overactivation of left in contrast to right Heschl's gyrus independently from tinnitus laterality and anatomical hemispheric differences. Tinnitus duration and distress were associated with areas involved in attentional and emotional processing. This is in line with recent findings indicating the relevance of higher order areas in the pathophysiology of tinnitus. Earlier results of asymmetric activation of the auditory cortices in tinnitus were confirmed, i.e., left-sided overactivation was found independently from tinnitus laterality. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013.

Within this field, there is a strong need for more advanced, functional imaging measures, as abnormalities measured with structural imaging insufficiently explain clinicocognitive decline in MS. In this study we investigated functional connectivity changes in MS using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Data from 34 MS patients and 28 age and gender-matched controls was assessed using synchronization likelihood (SL) as a measure of functional interaction strength between brain regions, and graph analysis to characterize topological patterns of connectivity changes. Cognition was assessed using extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Structural measures included brain and lesion volumes, using MRI. Results show SL increases in MS patients in theta, lower alpha and beta bands, with decreases in the upper alpha band. Graph analysis revealed a more regular topology in the lower alpha band in patients, indicated by an increased path length (?) and clustering coefficient (?). Attention and working memory domains were impaired, with decreased brain volumes. A stepwise linear regression model using clinical, MRI and MEG parameters as predictors revealed that only increases in lower alpha band ? predicted impaired cognition. Cognitive impairments and related altered connectivity patterns were found to be especially predominant in male patients. These results show specific functional changes in MS as measured with MEG.

344,343,"Experientially opening oneself to pain rather than avoiding it is said to reduce the mind's tendency toward avoidance or anxiety which can further exacerbate the experience of pain. This is a central feature of mindfulness-based therapies. Little is known about the neural mechanisms of mindfulness on pain. During a meditation practice similar to mindfulness, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used in expert meditators (>10,000 h of practice) to dissociate neural activation patterns associated with pain, its anticipation, and habituation. Compared to novices, expert meditators reported equal pain intensity, but less unpleasantness. This difference was associated with enhanced activity in the dorsal anterior insula (al), and the anterior mid-cingulate (aMCC) the so-called 'salience network', for experts during pain. This enhanced activity during pain was associated with reduced baseline activity before pain in these regions and the amygdala for experts only. The reduced baseline activation in left al correlated with lifetime meditation experience. This pattern of low baseline activity coupled with high response in alns and aMCC was associated with enhanced neural habituation in amygdala and pain-related regions before painful stimulation and in the pain-related regions during painful stimulation. These findings suggest that cultivating experiential openness down-regulates anticipatory representation of aversive events, and increases the recruitment of attentional resources during pain, which is associated with faster neural habituation.

We here used parameters derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the effect of focal white matter ischemia on functional reorganization within the motor system. Patients (n = 18) suffering from hand motor deficits in the subacute or chronic stage after subcortical stroke and healthy controls (n = 12) were scanned with both diffusion MRI and functional MRI while performing a motor task with the left or right hand. A laterality index was employed on activated voxels to assess functional reorganization across hemispheres. Regression analyses revealed that diffusion MRI parameters of both the ipsilesional corticospinal tract (CST) and corpus callosum (CC) predicted increased activation of the unaffected hemisphere during movements of the stroke-affected hand. Changes in diffusion MRI parameters possibly reflecting axonal damage and/or destruction of myelin sheath correlated with a stronger bilateral recruitment of motor areas and poorer motor performance. Probabilistic fiber tracking analyses revealed that the region in the CC correlating with the fMRI laterality index and motor deficits connected to sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, ventral premotor cortex, superior parietal lobule, and temporoparietal junction.

346,345,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by widespread structural and functional abnormalities in the cortico-striato-thalmo-cortical (CSTC) loops that subserve attention and executive functions. In this study, we analyzed thalamic shape and its white matter connections using structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion (DTI) data acquired from children with ADHD (n=19) and controls (n=19). Shape morphology of the thalamus was assessed using shape-based analysis, while connectivity between the thalamus and other brain regions was determined using probabilistic diffusion tractography. Shape-based analysis indicated significant regional atrophy in the left thalamus in children with ADHD compared to controls. Group analyses of white matter connectivity measures showed significantly decreased mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and volume of the tracts between thalamus and striatum, hippocampus, and prefrontal lobe in children with ADHD compared to controls.

347,346,"The elaboration of the myelinated white matter is essential for normal neurodevelopment, establishing and mediating rapid communication pathways throughout the brain. These pathways facilitate the synchronized communication required for higher order behavioral and cognitive functioning. Altered neural messaging (or 'disconnectivity') arising from abnormal white matter and myelin development may underlie a number of neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. Despite the vital role myelin plays, few imaging studies have specifically examined its maturation throughout early infancy and childhood. Thus, direct investigations of the relationship(s) between evolving behavioral and cognitive functions and the myelination of the supporting neural systems have been sparse. Further, without knowledge of the 'normative' developmental time-course, identification of early abnormalities associated with developmental disorders remains challenging. In this work, we examined the use of longitudinal (T-1) and transverse (T-2) relaxation time mapping, and myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging to investigate white matter and myelin development in 153 healthy male and female children, 3 months through 60 months in age. Optimized age-specific acquisition protocols were developed using the DESPOT and mcDESPOT imaging techniques; and mean T-1, T-2 and MWF trajectories were determined for frontal, temporal, occipital, parietal and cerebellar white matter, and genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum. MWF results provided a spatio-temporal pattern in-line with prior histological studies of myelination. Comparison of T-1, T-2 and MWF measurements demonstrates dissimilar sensitivity to tissue changes associated with neurodevelopment, with each providing differential but complementary information.

348,347,"Pain is known to comprise sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects. Despite numerous previous fMRI studies, however, it remains open which spatial distribution of activity is sufficient to encode whether a stimulus is perceived as painful or not. In this study, we analyzed fMRI data from a perceptual decision-making task in which participants were exposed to near-threshold laser pulses. Using multivariate analyses on different spatial scales, we investigated the predictive capacity of fMRI data for decoding whether a stimulus had been perceived as painful. Our analysis yielded a rank order of brain regions: during pain anticipation, activity in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) afforded the most accurate trial-by-trial discrimination between painful and non-painful experiences; whereas during the actual stimulation, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, anterior insula, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and OFC were most discriminative. The most accurate prediction of pain perception from the stimulation period, however, was enabled by the combined activity in pain regions commonly referred to as the 'pain matrix'. Our results demonstrate that the neural representation of (near-threshold) pain is spatially distributed and can be best described at an intermediate spatial scale. In addition to its utility in establishing structure-function mappings, our approach affords trial-by-trial predictions and thus represents a step towards the goal of establishing an objective neuronal marker of pain perception.

349,348,"In robot assisted gait training, a pattern of human locomotion is executed repetitively with the intention to restore the motor programs associated with walking. Several studies showed that active contribution to the movement is critical for the encoding of motor memory. We propose to use brain monitoring techniques during gait training to encourage active participation in the movement. We investigated the spectral patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that are related to active and passive robot assisted gait. Fourteen healthy participants were considered. Infomax independent component analysis separated the EEG into independent components representing brain, muscle, and eye movement activity, as well as other artifacts. An equivalent current dipole was calculated for each independent component. Independent components were clustered across participants based on their anatomical position and frequency spectra. Four clusters were identified in the sensorimotor cortices that accounted for differences between active and passive walking or showed activity related to the gait cycle. We show that in central midline areas the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (18-21 Hz) rhythms are suppressed during active compared to passive walking. These changes are statistically significant: mu (F(1, 13) = 11.2 p <= 0.01) and beta (F(1, 13) = 7.7, p <= 0.05). We also show that these differences depend on the gait cycle phases. We provide first evidence of modulations of the gamma rhythm in the band 25 to 40 Hz, localized in central midline areas related to the phases of the gait cycle. We observed a trend (F(1, 8) = 11.03, p <= 0.06) for suppressed low gamma rhythm when comparing active and passive walking. Additionally we found significant suppressions of the mu (F(1, 11) = 20.1 p <= 0.01), beta (F(1, 11) = 11.3 p <= 0.05) and gamma (F(1, 11) = 4.9 p <= 0.05) rhythms near C3 (in the right hand area of the primary motor cortex) during phases of active vs. passive robot assisted walking. To our knowledge this is the first study showing EEG analysis during robot assisted walking. We provide evidence for significant differences in cortical activation between active and passive robot assisted gait. Our findings may help to define appropriate features for single trial detection of active participation in gait training. This work is a further step toward the evaluation of brain monitoring techniques and brain-computer interface technologies for improving gait rehabilitation therapies in a top-down approach.

350,349,"Structural changes in neuroanatomical subregions can be measured using serial magnetic resonance imaging scans, and provide powerful biomarkers for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has made a large database of longitudinal scans available, with one of its primary goals being to explore the utility of structural change measures for assessing treatment effects in clinical trials of putative disease-modifying therapies. Several ADNI-funded research laboratories have calculated such measures from the ADNI database and made their results publicly available. Here, using sample size estimates, we present a comparative analysis of the overall results that come from the application of each laboratory's extensive processing stream to the ADNI database. Obtaining accurate measures of change requires correcting for potential bias due to the measurement methods themselves; and obtaining realistic sample size estimates for treatment response, based on longitudinal imaging measures from natural history studies such as ADNI, requires calibrating measured change in patient cohorts with respect to longitudinal anatomical changes inherent to normal aging. We present results showing that significant longitudinal change is present in healthy control subjects who test negative for amyloid-beta pathology. Therefore, sample size estimates as commonly reported from power calculations based on total structural change in patients, rather than change in patients relative to change in healthy controls, are likely to be unrealistically low for treatments targeting amyloid-related pathology. Of all the measures publicly available in ADNI, thinning of the entorhinal cortex quantified with the Quarc methodology provides the most powerful change biomarker. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

351,350,"Noninvasive brain imaging methods provide useful information on cerebral involution and degenerative processes. Here we assessed cortical degeneration in 20 nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 20 healthy controls using three quantitative neuroanatomical approaches: voxel-based morphometry (VBM), cortical folding (BrainVisa), and cortical thickness (FreeSurfer). We examined the relationship between global and regional gray matter (GM) volumes, sulcal indices, and thickness measures derived from the previous methods as well as their association with cognitive performance, age, severity of motor symptoms, and disease stage. VBM analyses showed GM volume reductions in the left temporal gyrus in patients compared with controls. Cortical folding measures revealed significant decreases in the left frontal and right collateral sulci in patients. Finally, analysis of cortical thickness showed widespread cortical thinning in right lateral occipital, parietal and left temporal, frontal, and premotor regions. We found that, in patients, all global anatomical measures correlated with age, while GM volume and cortical thickness significantly correlated with disease stage. In controls, a significant association was found between global GM volume and cortical folding with age. Overall these results suggest that the three different methods provide complementary and related information on neurodegenerative changes occurring in PD, however, surface-based measures of cortical folding and especially cortical thickness seem to be more sensitive than VBM to identify regional GM changes associated to PD.

352,351,"While schizophrenia is frequently characterized as a disorder of disturbed functional connectivity, the causes and pathophysiological origins of such disturbances remain unclear. The aim of this study was to better elucidate the mechanistic causes of abnormal functional connectivity in schizophrenia, measured as the extent of temporal correlation between endogenous fluctuations recorded at anatomically discrete brain regions during resting-state functional MRI. An approach was developed to perform whole-brain connectivity mapping at the resolution of individual pairs of voxels, without the need for arbitrary parcellation of the cerebrum. Between-group connectivity reductions in 12 people diagnosed with schizophrenia and 15 age-, IQ-, and gender-matched healthy volunteers were localized to a distributed network including frontoparietal and occipitoparietal connections. The gray-matter regions comprising this disturbed network showed evidence of local reductions in both intra-regional homogeneity (29%33% reduction) and signal power (40%60% reduction). The extent to which inter-regional correlation was reduced between a pair of gray matter regions was found to be strongly correlated with the extent of local decoherence evident within the gray matter regions per se. This suggests measurement of aberrant functional connectivity in schizophrenia is both a measurement of altered coupling between regions as well as a measurement of local decoherence within regions.

353,352,"Microglia play an essential role in many brain diseases. Microglia are activated by local tissue damage or inflammation, but systemic inflammation can also activate microglia. An important clinical question is whether the effects of systemic inflammation on microglia mediate the deleterious effects of systemic inflammation in diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with ligands that bind to Translocator Protein (TSPO) can be used to detect activated microglia. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the effect of systemic inflammation on microglia could be measured with PET imaging in nonhuman primates, using the TSPO ligand [C-11]PBR28. Methods: Six female baboons (Papio anubis) were scanned before and at 1 h and/or 4 h and/or 22 h after intravenous administration of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.1 mg/kg), which induces systemic inflammation. Regional time-activity data from regions of interest (ROIs) were fitted to the two-tissue compartmental model, using the metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curve as input function. Total volume of distribution (V-T) of [C-11]PBR28 was used as a measure of total ligand binding. The primary outcome was change in V-T from baseline. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were used to assess correlations between systemic inflammation and microglial activation. In one baboon, immunohistochemistry was used to identify cells expressing TSPO. Results: LPS administration increased [C-11]PBR28 binding (F(3,6)=5.1, p=.043) with a 29 +/- 16% increase at 1 h (n=4) and a 62 +/- 34% increase at 4 h (n=3) post-LPS. There was a positive correlation between serum IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels and the increase in [C-11]PBR28 binding. TSPO immunoreactivity occurred almost exclusively in microglia and rarely in astrocytes. Conclusion: In the nonhuman-primate brain, LPS-induced systemic inflammation produces a robust increase in the level of TSPO that is readily detected with [C-11]PBR28 PET. The effect of LPS on [C-11]PBR28 binding is likely mediated by inflammatory cytokines. Activation of microglia may be a mechanism through which systemic inflammatory processes influence the course of diseases such as Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and possibly depression.

354,353,"Pathological gambling (PG) is a behavioural addiction associated with elevated impulsivity and suspected dopamine dysregulation. Reduced striatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor availability has been reported in drug addiction, and may constitute a premorbid vulnerability marker for addictive disorders. The aim of the present study was to assess striatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor availability in PG, and its association with trait impulsivity. Males with PG (n = 9) and male healthy controls (n = 9) underwent [11C]-raclopride positron emission tomography imaging and completed the UPPS-P impulsivity scale. There was no significant difference between groups in striatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor availability, in contrast to previous reports in drug addiction. However, mood-related impulsivity ('Urgency') was negatively correlated with [11C]-raclopride binding potentials in the PG group. The absence of a group difference in striatal dopamine binding implies a distinction between behavioural addictions and drug addictions. Nevertheless, our data indicate heterogeneity in dopamine receptor availability in disordered gambling, such that individuals with high mood-related impulsivity may show differential benefits from dopamine-based medications.

Results revealed increases in hippocampus volume and in cortical thickness of the left middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus for interpreters relative to controls. The right hippocampus and the left superior temporal gyrus were structurally more malleable in interpreters acquiring higher proficiency in the foreign language. Interpreters struggling relatively more to master the language displayed larger gray matter increases in the middle frontal gyrus.

356,355,"Individuals have difficulty controlling their food consumption, which is due in part to the ubiquity of tempting food cues in the environment. Individual differences in the propensity to attribute incentive (motivational) salience to and act on these cues may explain why some individuals eat more than others. Using fMRI in healthy women, we found that food cue related activity in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for food motivation and reward, was related to subsequent snack food consumption. However, both nucleus accumbens activation and snack food consumption were unrelated to self-reported hunger, or explicit wanting and liking for the snack. In contrast, food cue reactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subjective hunger/appetite, but not with consumption. Whilst the food cue reactivity in the nucleus accumbens that predicted snack consumption was not directly related to body mass index (BMI), it was associated with increased BMI in individuals reporting low self-control. Our findings reveal a neural substrate underpinning automatic environmental influences on consumption in humans and demonstrate how self-control interacts with this response to predict BMI. Our data provide support for theoretical models that advocate a 'dual hit' of increased incentive salience attribution to food cues and poor self-control in determining vulnerability to overeating and overweight.

359,358,"According to an embodied view of language comprehension, language concepts are grounded in our perceptual systems. Evidence for the idea that concepts are grounded in areas involved in action and perception comes from both behavioral and neuroimaging studies (Glenberg [1997]: Behav Brain Sci 20:1-55; Barsalou [1999]: Behav Brain Sci 22:577-660; Pulvermueller [1999]: Behav Brain Sci 22:253-336; Barsalou et al. [2003]: Trends Cogn Sci 7:84-91). However, the results from several studies indicate that the activation of information in perception and action areas is not a purely automatic process (Raposo et al. [2009]: Neuropsychologia 47:388-396; Rueschemeyer et al. [2007]: J Cogn Neurosci 19:855-865). These findings suggest that embodied representations are flexible. In these studies, flexibility is characterized by the relative presence or absence of activation in our perceptual systems. However, even if the context in which a word is presented does not undermine a motor interpretation, it is possible that the degree to which a modality-specific region contributes to a representation depends on the context in which conceptual features are retrieved. In the present study, we investigated this issue by presenting word stimuli for which both motor and visual properties (e.g., Tennis ball, Boxing glove) were important in constituting the concept. Conform with the idea that language representations are flexible and context dependent, we demonstrate that the degree to which a modality-specific region contributes to a representation considerably changes as a function of context.

To date, there are only a few structural brain studies investigating local nonlinear aspects at the voxel level, i.e., without using anatomical ROIs as a priori hypothesis. Therefore, we analyzed 547 T1-weighted MR images of healthy adult brains with an age range of 19 to 86 years, including 161 scans of subjects with ages 60 and older. We found that the gray matter volume in some regions did not linearly decrease over time, but rather exhibited a delayed decline. Nonlinear age trajectories were observed in the medial temporal lobe regions, the basal ganglia, and parts of the cerebellum. Their trajectories indicated a preservation of grey matter volume during the early adult lifespan. Interestingly, we found nonlinear grey matter structural dynamics specifically in parts of the brain that have been extensively discussed in the context of learning and memory. We propose a hypothesis in relation to the functional role of these brain regions that may explain these results. Hum Brain Mapp 33:23772389, 2012.

361,360,"As humans, we gather a wide range of information about other people from watching them move. A network of parietal, premotor, and occipitotemporal regions within the human brain, termed the action observation network (AON), has been implicated in understanding others' actions by means of an automatic matching process that links observed and performed actions. Current views of the AON assume a matching process biased towards familiar actions; specifically, those performed by conspecifics and present in the observer's motor repertoire. In this study, we test how this network responds to form and motion cues when observing natural human motion compared to rigid robotic-like motion across two independent functional neuroimaging experiments. In Experiment 1, we report the surprising finding that premotor, parietal, occipitotemporal regions respond more robustly to rigid, robot-like motion than natural human motion. In Experiment 2, we replicate and extend this finding by demonstrating that the same pattern of results emerges whether the agent is a human or a robot, which suggests the preferential response to robot-like motion is independent of the agent's form. These data challenge previous ideas about AON function by demonstrating that the core nodes of this network can be flexibly engaged by novel, unfamiliar actions performed by both human and non-human agents. As such, these findings suggest that the AON is sensitive to a broader range of action features beyond those that are simply familiar. Hum Brain Mapp 33:22382254, 2012.

362,361,"Reconstructing the macroscopic human cortical connectome by Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a challenging research topic that has recently gained a lot of attention. In the present work, we investigate the effects of intra-voxel fiber direction modeling and tractography algorithm on derived structural network indices (e.g. density, small-worldness and global efficiency). The investigation is centered on three semi-independent distinctions within the large set of available diffusion models and tractography methods: i) single fiber direction versus multiple directions in the intra-voxel diffusion model, ii) deterministic versus probabilistic tractography and iii) local versus global measure-of-fit of the reconstructed fiber trajectories. The effect of algorithm and parameter choice has two components. First, there is the large effect of tractography algorithm and parameters on global network density, which is known to strongly affect graph indices. Second, and more importantly, there are remaining effects on graph indices which range in the tens of percent even when global density is controlled for. This is crucial for the sensitivity of any human structural network study and for the validity of study comparisons. We then investigate the effect of the choice of tractography algorithm on sensitivity and specificity of the resulting connections with a connectome dissection quality control (QC) approach. In this approach, evaluation of Tract Specific Density Coefficients (TSDCs) measures sensitivity while careful inspection of tractography path results assesses specificity. We use this to discuss interactions in the combined effects of these methods and implications for future studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

363,362,"Magnetic resonance imaging of pediatric brain provides valuable information for early brain development studies. Automated brain extraction is challenging due to the small brain size and dynamic change of tissue contrast in the developing brains. In this paper, we propose a novel Learning Algorithm for Brain Extraction and Labeling (LABEL) specially for the pediatric MR brain images. The idea is to perform multiple complementary brain extractions on a given testing image by using a meta-algorithm, including BET and BSE, where the parameters of each run of the meta-algorithm are effectively learned from the training data. Also, the representative subjects are selected as exemplars and used to guide brain extraction of new subjects in different age groups. We further develop a level-set based fusion method to combine multiple brain extractions together with a closed smooth surface for obtaining the final extraction. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated in subjects of three representative age groups, such as neonate (less than 2 months), infant (1-2 years), and child (5-18 years). Experimental results show that, with 45 subjects for training (15 neonates, 15 infant, and 15 children), the proposed method can produce more accurate brain extraction results on 246 testing subjects (75 neonates, 126 infants, and 45 children), i.e., at average Jaccard Index of 0.953, compared to those by BET (0.918). BSE (0.902), ROBEX (0.901), GCUT (0.856), and other fusion methods such as Majority Voting (0.919) and STAPLE (0.941). Along with the largely-improved computational efficiency, the proposed method demonstrates its ability of automated brain extraction for pediatric MR images in a large age range.

364,363,"Empathy is a multi-faceted concept consisting of our ability not only to share emotions but also to exert cognitive control and perspective taking in our interactions with others. Here we examined whether inter-individual variability in different components of empathy was related to differences in brain structure assessed using voxel-based morphometry. Following a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Multiple regression was then used to assess the relationship between individual differences in grey matter volume and individual differences in empathy traits. We found that individual differences in affective empathic abilities oriented towards another person were negatively correlated with grey matter volume in the precuneus, inferior frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate. Differences in self-oriented affective empathy were negatively correlated with grey matter volume of the somatosensory cortex, but positively correlated with volume in the insula; cognitive perspective taking abilities were positively correlated with grey matter volume of the anterior cingulate: and the ability to empathise with fictional characters was positively related to grey matter changes in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings are discussed in relation to neurocognitive models of empathy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

365,364,"Decision-making invokes two fundamental axes of control: affect or valence, spanning reward and punishment, and effect or action, spanning invigoration and inhibition. We studied the acquisition of instrumental responding in healthy human volunteers in a task in which we orthogonalized action requirements and outcome valence. Subjects were much more successful in learning active choices in rewarded conditions, and passive choices in punished conditions. Using computational reinforcement-learning models, we teased apart contributions from putatively instrumental and Pavlovian components in the generation of the observed asymmetry during learning. Moreover, using model-based fMRI, we showed that BOLD signals in striatum and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) correlated with instrumentally learnt action values, but with opposite signs for go and no-go choices. Finally, we showed that successful instrumental learning depends on engagement of bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Our behavioral and computational data showed that instrumental learning is contingent on overcoming inherent and plastic Pavlovian biases, while our neuronal data showed this learning is linked to unique patterns of brain activity in regions implicated in action and inhibition respectively.

366,365,"Motor imagery, passive movement, and movement observation have been suggested to activate the sensorimotor system without overt movement. The present study investigated these three covert movement modes together with overt movement in a within-subject design to allow for a fine-grained comparison of their abilities in activating the sensorimotor system, i.e. premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices. For this, 21 healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In addition we explored the abilities of the different covert movement modes in activating the sensorimotor system in a pilot study of 5 stroke patients suffering from chronic severe hemiparesis. Results demonstrated that while all covert movement modes activated sensorimotor areas, there were profound differences between modes and between healthy volunteers and patients. In healthy volunteers, the pattern of neural activation in overt execution was best resembled by passive movement, followed by motor imagery, and lastly by movement observation. In patients, attempted overt execution was best resembled by motor imagery, followed by passive movement and lastly by movement observation. Our results indicate that for severely hemiparetic stroke patients motor imagery may be the preferred way to activate the sensorimotor system without overt behavior. In addition, the clear differences between the covert movement modes point to the need for within-subject comparisons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

367,366,"A novel framework for analysing task-positive data in magnetoencephalography (MEG) is presented that can identify task-related networks. Techniques that combine beamforming, the Hilbert transform and temporal independent component analysis (ICA) have recently been applied to resting-state MEG data and have been shown to extract resting-state networks similar to those found in fMRI. Here we extend this approach in two ways. First, we systematically investigate optimisation of time-frequency windows for connectivity measurement. This is achieved by estimating the distribution of functional connectivity scores between nodes of known resting-state networks and contrasting it with a distribution of artefactual scores that are entirely due to spatial leakage caused by the inverse problem. We find that functional connectivity, both in the resting-state and during a cognitive task, is best estimated via correlations in the oscillatory envelope in the 8-20 Hz frequency range, temporally down-sampled with windows of 1-4 s. Second, we combine ICA with the general linear model (GLM) to incorporate knowledge of task structure into our connectivity analysis. The combination of ICA with the GLM helps overcome problems of these techniques when used independently: namely, the interpretation and separation of interesting independent components from those that represent noise in ICA and the correction for multiple comparisons when applying the GLM. We demonstrate the approach on a 2-back working memory task and show that this novel analysis framework is able to elucidate the functional networks involved in the task beyond that which is achieved using the GLM alone. We find evidence of localised task-related activity in the area of the hippocampus, which is difficult to detect reliably using standard methods.

369,368,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients suffer from risk aversion, which may be mediated by their exaggerated response to threat and diminished response to reward. In this study, 13 OCD patients and 13 healthy matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while playing an interactive risky choice game encompassing distinct intervals of threat and reward; as well as anatomical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Compared to healthy controls OCD patients were reluctant to make risky choices during the game. Furthermore, they displayed higher amygdala activation to threat; lower nucleus accumbens (Nacc) activation to reward and reduced functional connectivity of the amygdala and Nacc to two frontal regions, the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), respectively. OCD patients also displayed reduced structural integrity in clusters within the uncinate and cingulum fiber tracts. Finally, these deficits in limbic-frontal connectivity pathways, both at the functional and structural level, were associated with severity of OCD symptoms, as well as with each other. Our results thus suggest that risk aversion in OCD is mediated by abnormal limbic responses to threatening and rewarding stimuli, as well as by deficient functional and structural limbic-frontal connectivity.

370,369,"Most internally oriented mental activities are known to strongly activate the default network, which includes remembering the past, future thinking and social cognition, and are heavily self-referential, and demanding of memory retrieval processes. Based on these observations and building on related findings from the literature, the present article proposed a simple, dual-subsystem model of the default network. The ability of the model to estimate brain activity during autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval and related reference conditions was then tested by performing a quantitative meta-analysis of relevant literature. The model divided the default network into two subsystems. The first, called the 'cortical midline subsystem (CMS)', was comprised of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, and primarily mediates self-referential processing. The other, termed the 'parieto-temporal subsystem (PTS)', included the inferior parietal lobule, medial temporal lobe and lateral temporal cortex, and mainly supports memory retrieval processes. The meta-analysis of AM retrieval contrasts yielded a double dissociation that was consistent with this model. First, CMS regions associated more with an AM > laboratory-based memory (LM) contrast than with an AM > rest contrast, confirming that these regions play more critical roles in self-referential processing than memory retrieval processes. Second, all three PTS regions showed a greater association with an AM > rest contrast than with an AM > LM contrast, confirming that their role in memory retrieval processes is greater than in self-referential processing. Although the present model is limited in scope, both in terms of anatomical and functional specifications, it integrates diverse processes such as self-referential processing, episodic and semantic memory and subsystem interface, and provides useful heuristics that can guide further research on fractionation of the default network.

372,371,"Most statistical analyses of fMRI data assume that the nature, timing and duration of the psychological processes being studied are known. However, often it is hard to specify this information a priori. In this work we introduce a data-driven technique for partitioning the experimental time course into distinct temporal intervals with different multivariate functional connectivity patterns between a set of regions of interest (ROIs). The technique, called Dynamic Connectivity Regression (DCR), detects temporal change points in functional connectivity and estimates a graph, or set of relationships between ROIs, for data in the temporal partition that falls between pairs of change points. Hence, DCR allows for estimation of both the time of change in connectivity and the connectivity graph for each partition, without requiring prior knowledge of the nature of the experimental design. Permutation and bootstrapping methods are used to perform inference on the change points. The method is applied to various simulated data sets as well as to an fMRI data set from a study (N = 26) of a state anxiety induction using a socially evaluative threat challenge. The results illustrate the method's ability to observe how the networks between different brain regions changed with subjects' emotional state. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

374,373,"In the context of focal and drug-resistant epilepsy, surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone may be the only therapeutic option for reducing or suppressing seizures. In many such patients, intracranial stereo-EEG recordings remain the gold standard for the epilepsy surgery work-up. Assessing the extent of the epileptogenic zone and its organisation is a crucial objective, and requires advanced methods of signal processing. Over the last ten years, considerable efforts have been made to develop signal analysis techniques for characterising the connectivity between spatially distributed regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in dynamic connectivity pattern under inter-ictal, pre-ictal and ictal conditions using signals derived from stereo-EEG recordings of 10 patients with Taylor-type focal cortical dysplasia. A causal linear multivariate method - partial directed coherence - and indices derived from graph theory were used to characterise the synchronisation property of the lesional zone (corresponding to the epileptogenic zone in our patients) and to distinguish it from other regions involved in ictal activity or not. The results show that a significantly different connectivity pattern (mainly in the gamma band) distinguishes the epileptogenic zone from other cortical regions not only during the ictal event, but also during the inter- and pre-ictal periods. This indicates that the lesional nodes play a leading role in generating and propagating ictal EEG activity by acting as the hubs of the epileptic network originating and sustaining seizures. Our findings also indicate that the cortical regions beyond the dysplasia involved in the ictal activity essentially act as ""secondary"" generators of synchronous activity. The leading role of the lesional zone may account for the good post-surgical outcome of patients with type II focal cortical dysplasia as resecting the dysplasia removes the epileptogenic zone responsible for seizure organisation. Furthermore, our findings strongly suggest that advanced signal processing techniques aimed at studying synchronisation and characterising brain networks could substantially improve the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy, even in cases without an associated anatomically detectable lesion.

375,374,"The neurophysiological underpinnings of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are not well understood. To understand the relationship between the fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and neurophysiology across large areas of cortex, we compared task related BOLD change during simple finger movement to brain surface electric potentials measured on a similar spatial scale using electrocorticography (ECoG). We found that spectral power increases in high frequencies (65-95 Hz), which have been related to local neuronal activity, colocalized with spatially focal BOLD peaks on primary sensorimotor areas. Independent of high frequencies, decreases in low frequency rhythms (<30 Hz), thought to reflect an aspect of cortical-subcortical interaction, colocalized with weaker BOLD signal increase. A spatial regression analysis showed that there was a direct correlation between the amplitude of the task induced BOLD change on different areas of primary sensorimotor cortex and the amplitude of the high frequency change. Low frequency change explained an additional, different part of the spatial BOLD variance. Together, these spectral power changes explained a significant 36% of the spatial variance in the BOLD signal change (R2 = 0.36). These results suggest that BOLD signal change is largely induced by two separate neurophysiological mechanisms, one being spatially focal neuronal processing and the other spatially distributed low frequency rhythms.

376,375,"This study uses surfaced-based morphometry to investigate cortical thinning and its functional correlates in patients with major depressive disorder (MOD). Subjects with MOD (N = 36) and healthy control subjects (N = 36) were enrolled in the study. Each subject received T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), clinical evaluations, and neuropsychological examinations of executive functions with the Color Trail Test (CTT) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). This study used an automated surface-based method (FreeSurfer) to measure cortical thickness and to generate the thickness maps for each subject. Statistical comparisons were performed using a general linear model. Compared with healthy controls, subjects with MDD showed the largest area of cortical thinning in the prefrontal cortex. This study also noted smaller areas of cortical thinning in the bilateral inferior parietal cortex, left middle temporal gyrus, left entorhinal cortex, left lingual cortex, and right postcentral gyrus. Regression analysis demonstrated cortical thinning in several frontoparietal regions, predicting worse executive performance measured by CTT 2, though the patterns of cortical thickness/executive performance correlation differed in healthy controls and MDD subjects. In conclusion, the results provide further evidence for the significant role of a prefrontal structural deficit and an aberrant structural/functional relationship in patients with MOD.

In this study, we used voxel-based DTI to investigate possible whole-brain differences in the white matter FA values between 58 schizophrenia patients and 58 healthy controls. We also explored the association between FA values and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia. Compared with the controls, the schizophrenia patients showed significant FA reductions in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and genu of right internal capsule. Furthermore, in the patient group, the FA value of the anterior part of the corpus callosum was negatively correlated with the avolition score on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms.

378,377,"Youths with conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder and psychopathic traits (CD/ODD + PT) are at high risk of adult antisocial behavior and psychopathy. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate functional abnormalities in orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala in both youths and adults with psychopathic traits. Diffusion tensor imaging in psychopathic adults demonstrates disrupted structural connectivity between these regions (uncinate fasiculus). The current study examined whether functional neural abnormalities present in youths with CD/ODD + PT are associated with similar white matter abnormalities. Youths with CD/ODD + PT and comparison participants completed 3.0 T diffusion tensor scans and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Diffusion tensor imaging did not reveal disruption in structural connections within the uncinate fasiculus or other white matter tracts in youths with CD/ODD + PT, despite the demonstration of disrupted amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity in these youths. These results suggest that disrupted amygdala-frontal white matter connectivity as measured by fractional anisotropy is less sensitive than imaging measurements of functional perturbations in youths with psychopathic traits.

380,379,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is marked by inhibitory and attentional deficits which can persist into adulthood. Those deficits have been associated with dysfunctional fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal circuits. The present study sought to delineate neural correlates of component specific inhibitory deficits in adult ADHD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 20 adult ADHD patients and 24 matched healthy controls were included. Brain activation was assessed during three stages of behavioral inhibition, i.e. interference inhibition (Simon task), action withholding (Go/no-go task) and action cancelation (Stop-signal task). Behaviorally, ADHD patients were affected in all tasks. Impaired interference inhibition was associated with hypoactivation in parietal and medial frontal regions. During action withholding and cancelation ADHD patients displayed hypoactivation in a fronto-striatal network. These findings support the notion of at least two disturbed neural circuits in ADHD differentially associated with deficits in separate inhibitory subcomponents. Thereby, deficits in inhibitory subcomponents which are closely connected to response interference were related to hypofunction in more attention related circuits, while stopping related deficits were rather associated with hypofunction in inhibitory circuits.

384,382,"Processing of subjective pleasantness is essential in daily life decision making, particularly in the context of cognitive and environmental factors. Pleasure is mediated by a neural network and this network has been suggested to be the biological basis of pleasure including a whole range of different modalities and domains of pleasantness. This quantitative meta-analysis of brain imaging data focuses on studies 1) based on correlations between self-reported judgements of pleasantness and brain regions and investigates whether 2) immediate (during scanning) versus subsequent judgements (after scanning) differ in brain activity. We investigated concurrence across 40 studies reporting brain regions correlated with self-reported judgements of subjective pleasantness (attractiveness, liking or beauty) by means of activation likelihood estimation (ALE). Positive correlates of subjective pleasantness were found in mOFC, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, left ventral striatum, pregenual cortex, right cerebellum, left thalamus and the mid cingulate cortex. Negative correlates were found in left precentral gyms, right cerebellum and right inferior frontal gyrus. A comparison of studies with subjective pleasantness judgement during or after scanning revealed no significant differences in brain activation. We conclude that subjective pleasantness judgements are directly related to brain regions that have been described as part of the reward circuitry (mOFC, ventral striatum). The results suggest that the evaluation of likability or pleasure is an automatic process and that it is neither elicited nor enhanced by instructions to report the outcome of these judgements.

385,383,"Bidirectional integration between sensory stimuli and contextual framing is fundamental to action control. Stimuli may entail context-dependent actions, while temporal or spatial characteristics of a stimulus train may establish a contextual framework for upcoming stimuli. Here we aimed at identifying core areas for stimulus-context integration and delineated their functional connectivity (FC) using meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) and analysis of resting-state networks. In a multi-study conjunction, consistently increased activity under higher demands on stimulus-context integration was predominantly found in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), which represented the largest cluster of overlap and was thus used as the seed for the FC analyses. The con unction between task-dependent (MACM) and task-free (resting state) FC of the right TPJ revealed a shared network comprising bilaterally inferior parietal and frontal cortices, anterior insula, premotor cortex, putamen and cerebellum, i.e., a 'ventral' action/attention network. Stronger task-dependent (vs. task-free) connectivity was observed with the pre-SMA, dorsal premotor cortex, intraparietal sulcus, basal ganglia and primary sensori motor cortex, while stronger resting-state (vs. task-dependent) connectivity was found with the dorsolateral prefrontal and medial parietal cortex. Our data provide strong evidence that the right TPJ may represent a key region for the integration of sensory stimuli and contextual frames in action control. Task-dependent associations with regions related to stimulus processing and motor responses indicate that the right TPJ may integrate 'collaterals' of sensory processing and apply (ensuing) contextual frames, most likely via modulation of preparatory loops. Given the pattern of resting-state connectivity, internal states and goal representations may provide the substrates for the contextual integration within the TPJ in the absence of a specific task.

Furthermore, stronger intrinsic connectivity within the right dorsal anterior insula network was associated with better performance on a task involving attention and processing speed whereas stronger connectivity within the right ventral anterior insula network was associated with more intense affective experience.

389,387,"Background: Brain dopamine neurons code rewarding environmental stimuli by releasing endogenous dopamine, a transmission signal that is important for reinforcement learning. Human reward-seeking gambling behavior, and especially pathological gambling, has been presumed to be modulated by brain dopamine. Methods: Striatal dopamine release was studied with [C-11]raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) during gambling with an ecologically valid slot machine gambling task. Twenty-four males with and without pathological gambling (DSM-IV) were scanned three times, and the effects of different gambling outcomes (high-reward and low-reward vs. control task) on dopamine release were evaluated. Results: Striatal dopamine was released in both groups during high-reward but also low-reward tasks. The dopamine release during the low-reward task was located in the associative part of the caudate nucleus. During the high-reward task, the effect was also seen in the ventral striatum and the magnitude of dopamine release was associated with parallel gambling ""high"". Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between dopamine release during the low-reward and the high-reward task. There was no general difference in the magnitude of dopamine release between pathological gamblers and controls. However, in pathological gamblers, dopamine release correlated positively with gambling symptom severity. Conclusions: Striatal dopamine is released during gambling irrespective of gambling outcome suggesting that the mere expectation/prediction of reward is sufficient to induce dopaminergic changes. Although dopamine release during slot machine gambling is comparable between healthy controls and pathological gamblers, greater gambling symptom severity is associated with greater dopaminergic responses. Thus, as the dopamine reward deficiency theory predicts blunted mesolimbic dopamine responses to gambling in addicted individuals, our results question the validity of the reward deficiency hypothesis in pathological gambling.

390,388,"The scenario considered here is one where brain connectivity is represented as a network and an experimenter wishes to assess the evidence for an experimental effect at each of the typically thousands of connections comprising the network. To do this, a univariate model is independently fitted to each connection. It would be unwise to declare significance based on an uncorrected threshold of alpha=0.05, since the expected number of false positives for a network comprising N=90 nodes and N(N - 1)/2=4005 connections would be 200. Control of Type I errors over all connections is therefore necessary. The network-based statistic (NBS) and spatial pairwise clustering (SPC) are two distinct methods that have been used to control family-wise errors when assessing the evidence for an experimental effect with mass univariate testing. The basic principle of the NBS and SPC is the same as supra-threshold voxel clustering. Unlike voxel clustering, where the definition of a voxel cluster is unambiguous, 'clusters' formed among supra-threshold connections can be defined in different ways. The NBS defines clusters using the graph theoretical concept of connected components. SPC on the other hand uses a more stringent pairwise clustering concept. The purpose of this article is to compare the pros and cons of the NBS and SPC, provide some guidelines on their practical use and demonstrate their utility using a case study involving neuroimaging data.

391,389,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to placental insufficiency affects 5-10% of all pregnancies and it is associated with a wide range of short- and long-term neurodevelopmental disorders. Prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in IUGR is among the clinical challenges of modern fetal medicine and pediatrics. In recent years several studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate differences in brain structure in IUGR subjects, but the ability to use MRI for individual predictive purposes in IUGR is limited. Recent research suggests that MRI in vivo access to brain connectivity might have the potential to help understanding cognitive and neurodevelopment processes. Specifically, MRI based connectomics is an emerging approach to extract information from MRI data that exhaustively maps inter-regional connectivity within the brain to build a graph model of its neural circuitry known as brain network. In the present study we used diffusion MRI based connectomics to obtain structural brain networks of a prospective cohort of one year old infants (32 controls and 24 IUGR) and analyze the existence of quantifiable brain reorganization of white matter circuitry in IUGR group by means of global and regional graph theory features of brain networks. Based on global and regional analyses of the brain network topology we demonstrated brain reorganization in IUGR infants at one year of age. Specifically, IUGR infants presented decreased global and local weighted efficiency, and a pattern of altered regional graph theory features. By means of binomial logistic regression, we also demonstrated that connectivity measures were associated with abnormal performance in later neurodevelopmental outcome as measured by Bayley Scale for Infant and Toddler Development, Third edition (BSID-III) at two years of age. These findings show the potential of diffusion MRI based connectomics and graph theory based network characteristics for estimating differences in the architecture of neural circuitry and developing imaging biomarkers of poor neurodevelopment outcome in infants with prenatal diseases.

391,389,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to placental insufficiency affects 5-10% of all pregnancies and it is associated with a wide range of short- and long-term neurodevelopmental disorders. Prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in IUGR is among the clinical challenges of modern fetal medicine and pediatrics. In recent years several studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate differences in brain structure in IUGR subjects, but the ability to use MRI for individual predictive purposes in IUGR is limited. Recent research suggests that MRI in vivo access to brain connectivity might have the potential to help understanding cognitive and neurodevelopment processes.

392,390,"Results from studies that have examined age-related changes in gray matter based on structural MRI scans have not always been consistent. Reasons for this variability likely include small or unevenly-distributed samples, different methods for tissue class segmentation and spatial normalization, and the use of different statistical models. Particularly relevant to the latter is the method of adjusting for global (total) gray matter when making inferences about regionally-specific changes. In the current study, we use voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to explore the impact of these methodological choices in assessing age-related changes in gray matter volume in a sample of 420 adults evenly distributed between the ages of 18-77 years. At a broad level, we replicate previous findings, showing age-related gray matter decline in nearly all parts of the brain, with particularly rapid decline in inferior regions of frontal cortex (e.g., insula and left inferior frontal gyrus) and the central sulcus. Segmentation was improved by increasing the number of tissue classes and using less age-biased templates, and registration was improved by using a diffeomorphic flow-based algorithm (DARTEL) rather than a ""constrained warp"" approach. Importantly, different approaches to adjusting for global effects - not adjusting, Local Covariation, Global Scaling, and Local Scaling - significantly affected regionally-specific estimates of age-related decline, as demonstrated by ranking age effects across anatomical ROIs. Split-half cross-validation showed that, on average, Local Covariation explained a greater proportion of age-related variance across these ROIs than did Global Scaling. Nonetheless, the appropriate choice for global adjustment depends on one's assumptions and specific research questions. More generally, these results emphasize the importance of being explicit about the assumptions underlying key methodological choices made in VBM analyses and the inferences that follow.

393,391,"We aimed to investigate the effect of hand effector and handedness on the cerebral lateralization of pantomiming learned movements. Fourteen right-handed and 14 left-handed volunteers performed unimanual and bimanual tool-use pantomimes with their dominant or nondominant hand during fMRI. A left hemispheric lateralization was observed in the right- and left-handed group regardless of which hand(s) performed the task. Asymmetry was most marked in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), premotor cortex (PMC), and superior and inferior parietal lobules (SPL and IPL). Unimanual pantomimes did not reveal any significant differences in asymmetric cerebral activation patterns between left- and right-handers. Bimanual pantomimes showed increased left premotor and posterior parietal activation in left- and right-handers. Lateralization indices (LI) of the 10% most active voxels in DLPFC, PMC, SPL, and IPL were calculated for each individual in a contrast that compared all tool versus all control conditions. Left-handers showed a significantly reduced overall LI compared with right-handers. This was mainly due to diminished asymmetry in the IPL and SPL. We conclude that the recollection and pantomiming of learned gestures recruits a similar left lateralized activation pattern in right and left-handed individuals. Handedness only influences the strength (not the side) of the lateralization, with left-handers showing a reduced degree of asymmetry that is most readily observed over the posterior parietal region. Together with similar findings in language and visual processing, these results point to a lesser hemispheric specialization in left-handers that may be considered in the cost/benefit assessment to explain the disproportionate handedness polymorphism in humans.

We here aimed to identify the DMN in the challenging patient population of disorders of consciousness encountered following coma. Experimental design: A spatial independent component analysis-based methodology permitted DMN assessment, decomposing connectivity in all its different sources either neuronal or artifactual. Three different selection criteria were introduced assessing anticorrelation-corrected connectivity with or without an automatic masking procedure and calculating connectivity scores encompassing both spatial and temporal properties. These three methods were validated on 10 healthy controls and applied to an independent group of 8 healthy controls and 11 severely brain-damaged patients [locked-in syndrome (n = 2), minimally conscious (n = 1), and vegetative state (n = 8)]. Principal observations: All vegetative patients showed fewer connections in the default-mode areas, when compared with controls, contrary to locked-in patients who showed near-normal connectivity. In the minimally conscious-state patient, only the two selection criteria considering both spatial and temporal properties were able to identify an intact right lateralized BOLD connectivity pattern, and metabolic PET data suggested its neuronal origin.

395,393,"The neural bases of gender differences in emotional, cognitive, and socials behaviors are largely unknown. Here, magnetic resonance imaging data from 336 women and 225 men revealed a gender dimorphism in the functional organization of the brain. Consistently across five research sites, women had 14% higher local functional connectivity density (lFCD) and up to 5% higher gray matter density than men in cortical and subcortical regions. The negative power scaling of the lFCD was steeper for men than for women, suggesting that the balance between strongly and weakly connected nodes in the brain is different across genders. The more distributed organization of the male brain than that of the female brain could help explain the gender differences in cognitive style and behaviors and in the prevalence of neuropsychiatric diseases (i.e., autism spectrum disorder).

397,395,"There are growing numbers of studies using machine learning approaches to characterize patterns of anatomical difference discernible from neuroimaging data. The high-dimensionality of image data often raises a concern that feature selection is needed to obtain optimal accuracy. Among previous studies, mostly using fixed sample sizes, some show greater predictive accuracies with feature selection, whereas others do not. In this study, we compared four common feature selection methods. 1) Pre-selected region of interests (ROIs) that are based on prior knowledge. 2) Univariate t-test filtering. 3) Recursive feature elimination (RFE), and 4) t-test filtering constrained by ROIs. The predictive accuracies achieved from different sample sizes, with and without feature selection, were compared statistically. To demonstrate the effect, we used grey matter segmented from the T1-weighted anatomical scans collected by the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as the input features to a linear support vector machine classifier. The objective was to characterize the patterns of difference between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and cognitively normal subjects, and also to characterize the difference between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and normal subjects. In addition, we also compared the classification accuracies between MCI patients who converted to AD and MCI patients who did not convert within the period of 12 months. Predictive accuracies from two data-driven feature selection methods (t-test filtering and RFE) were no better than those achieved using whole brain data. We showed that we could achieve the most accurate characterizations by using prior knowledge of where to expect neurodegeneration (hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). Therefore, feature selection does improve the classification accuracies, but it depends on the method adopted. In general, larger sample sizes yielded higher accuracies with less advantage obtained by using knowledge from the existing literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

398,396,"Response inhibition as measured during a stop-signal task refers to the ability to halt an action that has already been set in motion. Cortical and sub-cortical structures, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN), that are active during attempts to inhibit action are thought to contribute to a 'stop-process' that must gain dominance over a 'go-process' if inhibition is to be successful. We recorded local field potential activity from the STN of Parkinson's disease patients with implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes during a stop-signal task. In particular we measured activity in the STN that has traditionally been associated with motor action (gamma-band, 60-100 Hz) and inhibition (beta-band, 10-30 Hz). Our data support the idea that beta activity in the STN is related to the inhibition of motor action. Further, we report that gamma oscillatory activity responds robustly to stop-signals as well as go-signals. This unexpected finding might suggest that gamma activity supports a go-process that not only responds to go-signals, but is also sensitive to stimuli that signal stopping. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Because of its small volume, and its localization in the basal ganglia, the STN can best be visualized using ultra-high resolution 7 Testa (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the present study, first we individually segmented 7T MRI STN masks to generate atlas probability maps. Secondly, the individually segmented STN masks and the probability maps were used to derive cortico-subthalamic white matter tract strength. Tract strength measures were then taken to test two functional STN hypotheses which account for the efficiency in stopping a motor response: the right inferior fronto-subthalamic (rIFC-STN) hypothesis and the posterior medial frontal cortex-subthalamic (pMFC-STN) hypothesis. Results of two independent experiments show that increased white matter tract strength between the pMFC and STN results in better stopping behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

400,398,"Functionally, anxiety serves to increase vigilance towards aversive stimuli and improve the ability to detect and avoid danger. We have recently shown, for instance, that anxiety increases the ability to a) detect and b) instigate defensive responses towards aversive and not appetitive face stimuli in healthy individuals. This is arguably the key adaptive function of anxiety, yet the neural circuitry underlying this valence-specific effect is unknown. In the present translational study, we sought evidence for the proposition that dorsomedial regions of the prefrontal (DMPFC) and cingulate cortex constitute the human homologue of the rodent prelimbic and are thus associated with increased amygdala responding during this adaptive threat bias in anxiety. To this end, we applied a novel functional connectivity analysis to healthy subjects (N=20) identifying the emotion of fearful and happy faces in an fMRI scanner under anxious (threat of unpredictable foot shock) and non-anxious (safe) conditions. We showed that anxiety significantly increased positive DMPFC-amygdala connectivity during the processing of fearful faces. This effect was a) valence-specific (it was not seen for happy faces), b) paralleled by faster behavioral response to fearful faces, and c) correlated positively with trait anxiety. As such we provide the first experimental support for an anxiety-mediated, valence-specific, DMPFC-amygdala aversive amplification mechanism in healthy humans. This may be homologous to the rodent prelimbic-amygdala circuit and may, given the relationship with trait anxiety, underlie vulnerability to anxiety disorders. This study thus pinpoints a key neural mechanism in adaptive anxiety and highlights its potential link to maladaptive anxiety.

We enrolled patients with PD cognitively normal (PD-CogNL, n = 32), PD-MCI (n = 28), PDD (n = 25), DLB (n = 29), and age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (n = 40).

For the patient cohort, intersubject voxel-wise correlation was performed between FA values and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores. We also evaluated the gray matter and the cerebral perfusion by conducting a voxel-based analysis. There were significantly decreased FA values in many major tracts in patients with PD-MCI, PDD, and DLB, but not in PD-CogNL, compared with control subjects. FA values in the certain white matter areas, particularly the bilateral parietal white matter, were significantly correlated with MMSE scores in patients with PD. Patients with PDD and DLB had diffuse gray matter atrophy. All patient groups had occipital and posterior parietal hypoperfusion when compared with control subjects.

402,400,"Meta-analysis based techniques are emerging as powerful, robust tools for developing models of connectivity in functional neuroimaging. Here, we apply meta-analytic connectivity modeling to the human caudate to 1) develop a model of functional connectivity, 2) determine if meta-analytic methods are sufficiently sensitive to detect behavioral domain specificity within region-specific functional connectivity networks, and 3) compare meta-analytic driven segmentation to structural connectivity parcellation using diffusion tensor imaging. Results demonstrate strong coherence between meta-analytic and data-driven methods. Specifically, we found that behavioral filtering resulted in cognition and emotion related structures and networks primarily localized to the head of the caudate nucleus, while perceptual and action specific regions localized to the body of the caudate, consistent with early models of nonhuman primate histological studies and postmortem studies in humans. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed support for meta-analytic connectivity modeling's (MACM) utility in identifying both direct and indirect connectivity. Our results provide further validation of meta-analytic connectivity modeling, while also highlighting an additional potential, namely the extraction of behavioral domain specific functional connectivity.

404,402,"Most of what is known about the reorganization of functional brain networks that accompanies normal aging is based on neuroimaging studies in which participants perform specific tasks. In these studies, reorganization is defined by the differences in task activation between young and old adults. However, task activation differences could be the result of differences in task performance, strategy, or motivation, and not necessarily reflect reorganization. Resting-state fMRI provides a method of investigating functional brain networks without such confounds. Here, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used in an attempt to differentiate older adults from younger adults based on their resting-state functional connectivity. In addition, the information used by the SVM was investigated to see what functional connections best differentiated younger adult brains from older adult brains. Three separate resting-state scans from 26 younger adults (18-35 yrs) and 26 older adults (55-85) were obtained from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) dataset made publically available in the 1000 Functional Connectomes project www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon_1000.100 seed-regions from four functional networks with 5 mm(3) radius were defined based on a recent study using machine learning classifiers on adolescent brains. Time-series for every seed-region were averaged and three matrices of z-transformed correlation coefficients were created for each subject corresponding to each individual's three resting-state scans. SVM was then applied using leave-one-out cross-validation. The SVM classifier was 84% accurate in classifying older and younger adult brains. The majority of the connections used by the classifier to distinguish subjects by age came from seed-regions belonging to the sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular networks. These results suggest that age-related decreases in positive correlations within the cingulo-opercular and default networks, and decreases in negative correlations between the default and sensorimotor networks, are the distinguishing characteristics of age-related reorganization.

404,402,"Most of what is known about the reorganization of functional brain networks that accompanies normal aging is based on neuroimaging studies in which participants perform specific tasks. In these studies, reorganization is defined by the differences in task activation between young and old adults. However, task activation differences could be the result of differences in task performance, strategy, or motivation, and not necessarily reflect reorganization. Resting-state fMRI provides a method of investigating functional brain networks without such confounds. Here, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used in an attempt to differentiate older adults from younger adults based on their resting-state functional connectivity.

405,403,"Several studies have suggested that white matter integrity is disrupted in some brain regions in patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to assess the white matter integrity of the cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, fornix, and corpus callosum using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Participants comprised 39 patients with schizophrenia (19 males and 20 females) and 40 age-matched normal controls (20 males and 20 females). We quantitatively assessed the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the anterior cingulum, body of the cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, fornix, and corpus callosum on a tract-specific basis using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Group differences in FA and ADC between the patients and normal controls were sought. Additional exploratory analyses of the relationship between the FA or ADC and four clinical parameters (i.e., illness duration, positive symptom scores, negative symptom scores, and medication dosage) were performed. Results were analyzed in gender-combined and gender-separated group comparisons. FA was significantly lower on both sides of the anterior cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, and fornix in the schizophrenia patients irrespective of gender group separation. In the gender-combined analyses, significantly higher ADC values were demonstrated in the schizophrenia patients in both sides of the anterior cingulum, body of the cingulum and uncinate fasciculus, the left fornix, and the corpus callosum, compared with those of the normal controls. In the gender-separated analyses, the male patients showed higher ADC in the left anterior cingulum, the bilateral cingulum bodies, and the bilateral uncinate fasciculi. The female patients showed higher ADC in the right anterior cingulum, the left fornix, and the bilateral uncinate fasciculus. In correlation analyses, a significant negative correlation was found between illness duration and ADC in the right anterior cingulum in the gender-combined analyses. The gender-separated analyses found that the male patients had a significant negative correlation between negative symptom scores and FA in the right fornix, a positive correlation between illness duration and FA in the right anterior cingulum, and a negative correlation between illness duration and FA in the left uncinate fasciculus. Our DTI study showed that the integrity of white matter is disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. The results of our sub-analyses suggest that changes in FA and ADC may be related to negative symptom scores or illness duration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

406,404,"The objective of the present study was to investigate the microstructure and the macrostructure of the corpus callosum (CC) in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-nine participants with ADHD and 37 controls were included from the Norwegian ADHD project in Bergen. We measured the fractional anisotropy (FA) values, as well as the size of different subdivisions of the CC, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and anatomical MRI. The isthmus/splenium part of the CC in the ADHD group showed reduced FA values compared to the control group, whereas the size of the CC did not differ across groups. Our findings thus demonstrate a divergence between microstructural and macrostructural measures in the CC of adults with ADHD. This contrasts with findings in children demonstrating callosal abnormalities in both microstructure and macrostructure. Our results may indicate that adults with ADHD in part have succeeded in passing by an earlier developmental delay of the CC, resulting in a normalization of callosal macrostructure into adulthood. However, microstructural differences are still present in adults, which may point to an abnormal lateralization in adults with ADHD, or could be a sign of a persisting impairment.

408,406,"Characterizing interactions between multiple brain regions is important for understanding brain function. Functional connectivity measures based on partial correlation provide an estimate of the linear conditional dependence between brain regions after removing the linear influence of other regions. Estimation of partial correlations is, however, difficult when the number of regions is large, as is now increasingly the case with a growing number of large-scale brain connectivity studies. To address this problem, we develop novel methods for estimating sparse partial correlations between multiple regions in fMRI data using elastic net penalty (SPC-EN), which combines L1- and L2-norm regularization We show that L1-norm regularization in SPC-EN provides sparse interpretable solutions while L2-norm regularization improves the sensitivity of the method when the number of possible connections between regions is larger than the number of time points, and when pair-wise correlations between brain regions are high. An issue with regularization-based methods is choosing the regularization parameters which in turn determine the selection of connections between brain regions. To address this problem, we deploy novel stability selection methods to infer significant connections between brain regions. We also compare the performance of SPC-EN with existing methods which use only L1-norm regularization (SPC-L1) on simulated and experimental datasets. Detailed simulations show that the performance of SPC-EN, measured in terms of sensitivity and accuracy is superior to SPC-L1, especially at higher rates of feature prevalence. Application of our methods to resting-state fMRI data obtained from 22 healthy adults shows that SPC-EN reveals a modular architecture characterized by strong inter-hemispheric links, distinct ventral and dorsal stream pathways, and a major hub in the posterior medial cortex - features that were missed by conventional methods. Taken together, our findings suggest that SPC-EN provides a powerful tool for characterizing connectivity involving a large number of correlated regions that span the entire brain.

Following activation, these veins exhibit oxygenation changes but their volume likely stays constant. The back-reflection geometry of the NIRS measurement renders the signal very sensitive to these superficial pial veins. As such, the measured NIRS signal contains contributions from both the cortical region as well as the pial vasculature. In this work, the cortical contribution to the NIRS signal was investigated using (1) Monte Carlo simulations over a realistic geometry constructed from anatomical and vascular MRI and (2) multimodal NIRS-BOLD recordings during motor stimulation. A good agreement was found between the simulations and the modeling analysis of in vivo measurements. Our results suggest that the cortical contribution to the deoxyhemoglobin signal change (Delta HbR) is equal to 16-22% of the cortical contribution to the total hemoglobin signal change (Delta HbT). Similarly, the cortical contribution of the oxyhemoglobin signal change (,Delta HbO) is equal to 73-79% of the cortical contribution to the Delta HbT signal. These results suggest that Delta HbT is far less sensitive to pial vein contamination and therefore, it is likely that the Delta HbT signal provides better spatial specificity and should be used instead of Delta HbO or Delta HbR to map cerebral activity with NIRS.

410,408,"A key challenge in functional neuroimaging is the meaningful combination of results across subjects. Even in a sample of healthy participants, brain morphology and functional organization exhibit considerable variability, such that no two individuals have the same neural activation at the same location in response to the same stimulus. This inter-subject variability limits inferences at the group-level as average activation patterns may fail to represent the patterns seen in individuals. A promising approach to multi-subject analysis is group independent component analysis (GICA), which identifies group components and reconstructs activations at the individual level. GICA has gained considerable popularity, particularly in studies where temporal response models cannot be specified. However, a comprehensive understanding of the performance of GICA under realistic conditions of inter-subject variability is lacking. In this study we use simulated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to determine the capabilities and limitations of GICA under conditions of spatial, temporal, and amplitude variability. Simulations, generated with the SimTB toolbox, address questions that commonly arise in GICA studies, such as: (1) How well can individual subject activations be estimated and when will spatial variability preclude estimation? (2) Why does component splitting occur and how is it affected by model order? (3) How should we analyze component features to maximize sensitivity to intersubject differences? Overall, our results indicate an excellent capability of GICA to capture between-subject differences and we make a number of recommendations regarding analytic choices for application to functional imaging data.

In this study we combine magneto-encephalography (MEG) and network analysis to investigate the role of functional sub-networks (modules) in the brain with regard to cognitive failure in Alzheimer's disease. Whole-head resting-state (MEG) was performed in 18 Alzheimer patients (age 67 +/- 9.6 females, MMSE 23 +/- 5) and 18 healthy controls (age 66 +/- 9, 11 females, MMSE 29 +/- 1). We constructed functional brain networks based on interregional synchronization measurements, and performed graph theoretical analysis with a focus on modular organization. The overall modular strength and the number of modules changed significantly in Alzheimer patients. The parietal cortex was the most highly connected network area, but showed the strongest intramodular losses. Nonetheless, weakening of intermodular connectivity was even more outspoken, and more strongly related to cognitive impairment.

412,410,"The human insula is a functionally complex yet poorly understood region of the cortex, implicated in a wide range of cognitive, motor, emotion and somatosensory activity. To elucidate the functional role of the insula, the current study used in vivo probabilistic tractography to map the structural connectivity of seven anatomically-defined insular subregions. The connectivity patterns identified reveal two complementary insular networks connected via a dual route architecture, and provide key insights about the neural basis of the numerous functions ascribed to this area. Specifically, anterior-most insular regions were associated with a ventrally-based network involving orbital/inferior frontal and anterior/polar temporal regions, forming part of a key emotional salience and cognitive control network associated with the implementation of goal-directed behavior. The posterior and dorsal-middle insular regions were associated with a network focused on posterior and (to a lesser extent) anterior temporal regions via both dorsal and ventral pathways. This is consistent with the involvement of the insula in sound-to-speech transformations, with an implicated role in the temporal resolution, sequencing, and feedback processes crucial for auditory and motor processing, and the monitoring and adjustment of expressive performance.

413,411,"We investigated the neural underpinnings of timbral, tonal, and rhythmic features of a naturalistic musical stimulus. Participants were scanned with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while listening to a stimulus with a rich musical structure, a modern tango. We correlated temporal evolutions of timbral, tonal, and rhythmic features of the stimulus, extracted using acoustic feature extraction procedures, with the fMRI time series. Results corroborate those obtained with controlled stimuli in previous studies and highlight additional areas recruited during musical feature processing. While timbral feature processing was associated with activations in cognitive areas of the cerebellum, and sensory and default mode network cerebrocortical areas, musical pulse and tonality processing recruited cortical and subcortical cognitive, motor and emotion-related circuits. In sum, by combining neuroimaging, acoustic feature extraction and behavioral methods, we revealed the large-scale cognitive, motor and limbic brain circuitry dedicated to acoustic feature processing during listening to a naturalistic stimulus. In addition to these novel findings, our study has practical relevance as it provides a powerful means to localize neural processing of individual acoustical features, be it those of music, speech, or soundscapes, in ecological settings.

However, studies on cannabis abuse in relation to brain structure are sparse and results are inconsistent, probably due to differences in imaging methodology, severity of cannabis abuse, and use of other substances. The goal of the current MRI study was to investigate brain morphology related to current and lifetime severity of cannabis use and dependence in heavy cannabis users without intensive use of other illicit drugs. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess differences in regional grey and white matter volume between 33 heavy cannabis users and 42 matched controls. Within heavy cannabis users, grey and white matter volume was correlated with measures of cannabis use and dependence. Analyses were focused a priori on the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum, regions implicated in substance dependence and/or with high cannabinoid receptor-1 concentrations. Regional grey matter volume in the anterior cerebellum was larger in heavy cannabis users. Within the group of heavy cannabis users, grey matter volume in the amygdala and hippocampus correlated negatively with the amount of cannabis use or dependence. No associations were found between white matter volume and measures of cannabis use or dependence. These findings indicate that associations between heavy cannabis use and altered brain structure are complex. Differential patterns of structural changes for various cannabis use levels imply that alterations in brain structure are associated with specific characteristics of cannabis use and dependence.

415,413,"The modular organization of the brain network can vary in two fundamental ways. The amount of inter-versus intra-modular connections between network nodes can be altered, or the community structure itself can be perturbed, in terms of which nodes belong to which modules (or communities). Alterations have previously been reported in modularity, which is a function of the proportion of intra-modular edges over all modules in the network. For example, we have reported that modularity is decreased in functional brain networks in schizophrenia: There are proportionally more inter-modular edges and fewer intra-modular edges. However, despite numerous and increasing studies of brain modular organization, it is not known how to test for differences in the community structure, i.e., the assignment of regional nodes to specific modules. Here, we introduce a method based on the normalized mutual information between pairs of modular networks to show that the community structure of the brain network is significantly altered in schizophrenia, using resting-state fMRI in 19 participants with childhood-onset schizophrenia and 20 healthy participants. We also develop tools to show which specific nodes (or brain regions) have significantly different modular communities between groups, a subset that includes right insular and perisylvian cortical regions.

416,414,"T-2*-weighted gradient-echo MRI images at high field (>= 7 T) have shown rich image contrast within and between brain regions. The source for these contrast variations has been primarily attributed to tissue magnetic susceptibility differences. In this study, the contribution of myelin to both T-2* and frequency contrasts is investigated using a mouse model of demyelination based on a cuprizone diet. The demyelinated brains showed significantly increased T-2* in white matter and a substantial reduction in gray-white matter frequency contrast, suggesting that myelin is a primary source for these contrasts. Comparison of in-vivo and in-vitro data showed that, although tissue T-2* values were reduced by formalin fixation, gray-white matter frequency contrast was relatively unaffected and fixation had a negligible effect on cuprizone-induced changes in T-2* and frequency contrasts.

Little is known about the neurological effects of blast-related mTBI and whether they differ from those of civilian, non-blast mTBI. Given that brain damage from blasts may be diffuse and heterogeneous, we tested the hypothesis that blast mTBI is associated with subtle white matter disruptions in the brain that are spatially inconsistent across individuals. We used diffusion tensor imaging to examine white matter integrity, as quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA), in a group of American military service members with (n = 25) or without (n = 33) blast-related rnTBI who had been deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. History of civilian non-blast mTBI was equally common across groups, which enabled testing of both blast and non-blast mTBI effects on measures sensitive to (1) concentrated, spatially consistent (average FA within a region of interest [ROI]), (2) concentrated, spatially variable (number of ROIs with low average FA), and (3) diffuse (number of voxels with low FA) disruptions of white matter integrity. Blast mTBI was associated with a diffuse, global pattern of lower white matter integrity, and this pattern was not affected by previous civilian mTBI. Neither type of mTBI had an effect on the measures sensitive to more concentrated and spatially consistent white matter disruptions. Additionally, individuals with more than one blast mTBI tended to have a larger number of low FA voxels than individuals with a single blast injury. These results indicate that blast mTBI is associated with disrupted integrity of several white matter tracts, and that these disruptions are diluted by averaging across the large number of voxels within an ROI. The reported pattern of effects supports the conclusion that the neurological effects of blast mTBI are diffuse, widespread, and spatially variable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

418,416,"Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) allows the recovery of cortical oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin changes associated with evoked brain activity. NIRS is a back-reflection measurement making it very sensitive to the superficial layers of the head, i.e. the skin and the skull, where systemic interference occurs. As a result, the NIRS signal is strongly contaminated with systemic interference of superficial origin. A recent approach to overcome this problem has been the use of additional short source-detector separation optodes as regressors. Since these additional measurements are mainly sensitive to superficial layers in adult humans, they can be used to remove the systemic interference present in longer separation measurements, improving the recovery of the cortical hemodynamic response function (HRF). One question that remains to answer is whether or not a short separation measurement is required in close proximity to each long separation NIRS channel. Here, we show that the systemic interference occurring in the superficial layers of the human head is inhomogeneous across the surface of the scalp. As a result, the improvement obtained by using a short separation optode decreases as the relative distance between the short and the long measurement is increased. NIRS data was acquired on 6 human subjects both at rest and during a motor task consisting of finger tapping. The effect of distance between the short and the long channel was first quantified by recovering a synthetic hemodynamic response added over the resting-state data. The effect was also observed in the functional data collected during the finger tapping task. Together, these results suggest that the short separation measurement must be located as close as 1.5 cm from the standard NIRS channel in order to provide an improvement which is of practical use. In this case, the improvement in Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) compared to a standard General Linear Model (GLM) procedure without using any small separation optode reached 50% for HbO and 100% for HbR.

419,417,"Understanding others' emotions requires both the identification of overt behaviors (""smiling"") and the attribution of behaviors to a cause (""friendly disposition""). Previous research suggests that whereas emotion identification depends on a cortical mirror system that enables the embodiment of observed motor behavior within one's own motor system, causal attribution for emotion depends on a separate cortical mentalizing system, so-named because its function is associated with mental state representation. We used fMRI to test an Identification-Attribution model of mirror and mentalizing system contributions to the comprehension of emotional behavior. Normal volunteers watched a set of ecologically valid videos of human emotional displays. During each viewing, volunteers either identified an emotion-relevant motor behavior (explicit identification) or inferred a plausible social cause (explicit attribution). These explicit identification and attribution goals strongly distinguished activity in the mirror and mentalizing systems, respectively. However, frontal mirror areas, though preferentially engaged by the identification goal, nevertheless exhibited activation when observers possessed the attribution goal. One of these areas right posterior inferior frontal gyrus demonstrated effective connectivity with areas of the mentalizing system during attributional processing. These results support an integrative model of the neural systems supporting the comprehension of emotional behavior, where the mirror system helps facilitate the rapid identification of emotional expressions that then serve as inputs to attributional processing in the mentalizing system.

The work here is the first to empirically characterize individual variability in the haemodynamic response functions (HRFs) in response to a simple visual stimulus and baseline GABA concentration in a population of young adult males (n = 15, aged 2028 years). The results demonstrate that GABA concentration is negatively correlated with BOLD response amplitude (r = -0.64, P < 0.02) and positively correlated with HRF width (r = 0.67, P < 0.002), that is, individuals with higher resting GABA concentration tend to exhibit smaller and wider HRFs. No correlations were observed with resting cerebral blood flow and GABA concentration and similarly, no correlations were observed between GABA and the proportional tissue content of the MRS voxel. We argue that correlation of the height of the HRF is supportive of the view that the previously observed correlations between BOLD amplitudes and GABA are reflective of differences in neuronal activity. However, the changes in HRF shape in individuals with higher baseline GABA levels are suggestive that differing vascular response characteristics may also make a significant contribution.

421,419,"Increasing attention has recently been directed to the applications of pattern recognition and brain imaging techniques in the effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most of the existing research focuses on the use of single-modal (e.g., structural or functional MRI) or single-level (e.g., brain local or connectivity metrics) biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. In this study, we propose a methodological framework, called multi-modal imaging and multi-level characteristics with multi-classifier (M3), to discriminate patients with AD from healthy controls. This approach involved data analysis from two imaging modalities: structural MRI, which was used to measure regional gray matter volume, and resting-state functional MRI, which was used to measure three different levels of functional characteristics, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and regional functional connectivity strength (RFCS). For each metric, we computed the values of ninety regions of interest derived from a prior atlas, which were then further trained using a multi-classifier based on four maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis base classifiers. The performance of this method was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Applying the M3 approach to the dataset containing 16 AD patients and 22 healthy controls led to a classification accuracy of 89.47% with a sensitivity of 87.50% and a specificity of 90.91%. Further analysis revealed that the most discriminative features for classification are predominantly involved in several default-mode (medial frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus), occipital (fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle occipital gyrus) and subcortical (amygdale and pallidum of lenticular nucleus) regions. Thus, the M3 method shows promising classification performance by incorporating information from different imaging modalities and different functional properties, and it has the potential to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation of AD.

422,420,"Medical imaging has shown that, during early development, the brain undergoes more changes in size, shape and appearance than at any other time in life. A better understanding of brain development requires a spatio-temporal atlas that characterizes the dynamic changes during this period. In this paper we present an approach for constructing a 4D atlas of the developing brain, between 28 and 44 weeks post-menstrual age at time of scan, using T1 and T2 weighted MR images from 204 premature neonates. The method used for the creation of the average 4D atlas utilizes non-rigid registration between all pairs of images to eliminate bias in the atlas toward any of the original images. In addition, kernel regression is used to produce age-dependent anatomical templates. A novelty in our approach is the use of a time-varying kernel width, to overcome the variations in the distribution of subjects at different ages. This leads to an atlas that retains a consistent level of detail at every time-point. Comparisons between the resulting atlas and atlases constructed using affine and non-rigid registration are presented. The resulting 4D atlas has greater anatomic definition than currently available 4D atlases created using various affine and non-rigid registration approaches, an important factor in improving registrations between the atlas and individual subjects. Also, the resulting 4D atlas can serve as a good representative of the population of interest as it reflects both global and local changes.

Yet it remains a major challenge to unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in humans, we show that sleep spindles play a key role in the reactivation of memory-related neocortical representations. On separate days, participants either learned face-scene associations or performed a visuomotor control task. Spindle-coupled reactivation of brain regions representing the specific task stimuli was traced during subsequent NonREM sleep with EEG-informed fMRI. Relative to the control task, learning face-scene associations triggered a stronger combined activation of neocortical and hippocampal regions during subsequent sleep. Notably, reactivation did not only occur in temporal synchrony with spindle events but was tuned by ongoing variations in spindle amplitude. These learning-related increases in spindle-coupled neocortical activity were topographically specific because reactivation was restricted to the face- and scene-selective visual cortical areas previously activated during pre-sleep learning. Spindle-coupled hippocampal activation was stronger the better the participant had performed at prior learning.

424,422,"Facial emotions express our internal states and are fundamental in social interactions. Here we explore whether the repetition of unattended facial emotions builds up a predictive representation of frequently encountered emotions in the visual system. Participants (n = 24) were presented peripherally with facial stimuli expressing emotions while they performed a visual detection task presented in the center of the visual field. Facial stimuli consisted of four faces of different identity, but expressed the same emotion (happy or fearful). Facial stimuli were presented in blocks of oddball sequence (standard emotion: p = 0.9, deviant emotion: p = 0.1). Event-related potentials (ERPs) to the same emotions were compared when the emotions were deviant and standard, respectively. We found visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) responses to unattended deviant emotions in the 170-360 ms post-stimulus range over bilateral occipito-temporal sites. Our results demonstrate that information about the emotional content of unattended faces presented at the periphery of the visual field is rapidly processed and stored in a predictive memory representation by the visual system. We also found evidence that differential processing of deviant fearful faces starts already at 70-120 ms after stimulus onset. This finding shows a 'negativity bias' under unattended conditions. Differential processing of fearful deviants were more pronounced in the right hemisphere in the 195-275 ms and 360-390 ms intervals, whereas processing of happy deviants evoked larger differential response in the left hemisphere in the 360-390 ms range, indicating differential hemispheric specialization for automatic processing of positive and negative affect.

We found that the asymmetry is limited to the anterior hippocampus (hemisphere x region interaction: F(1,109) = 42.6, p<.001). Anterior hippocampal volume was correlated strongly with the volumes of all four cortical lobes. In contrast, posterior hippocampal volume was correlated strongly only with occipital lobe volume, moderately with the parietal and temporal lobe volumes and not with the frontal lobe volume. The degree of R>L anterior hippocampal volume asymmetry predicted performance on a measure of basic cognitive abilities. This provides evidence for regional specificity and functional implications of the well-known hemispheric asymmetry of hippocampal volume.

427,425,"Neuro-imaging studies have shown altered, yet often inconsistent, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We investigated both serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 drug-naive dogs with compulsive behaviour, as a potential model for human OCD. Single photon emission computed tomography was used with I-123-R91150 and I-123-FP-CIT, in combination with Tc-99m-ECD brain perfusion co-registration, to measure the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor, dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) availability. Fifteen normally behaving dogs were used as reference group. Significantly lower 5-HT2A receptor radioligand availability in frontal and temporal cortices (bilateral) was observed. Further, in 78% of the compulsive dogs abnormal DAT ratios in left and right striatum were demonstrated. Interestingly, both increased and decreased DAT ratios were observed. Finally, significantly lower subcortical perfusion and (hypo) thalamic SERF availability were observed in the compulsive dogs. This study provides evidence for imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in the pathophysiology of compulsions in dogs. The similarities with the altered neurotransmission in human OCD provide construct validity for this non-induced, natural canine model, suggesting its usefulness for future investigations of the pathophysiology of human OCD as well as the effectiveness of psychopharmacological interventions.

427,425,"Neuro-imaging studies have shown altered, yet often inconsistent, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We investigated both serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 drug-naive dogs with compulsive behaviour, as a potential model for human OCD. Single photon emission computed tomography was used with I-123-R91150 and I-123-FP-CIT, in combination with Tc-99m-ECD brain perfusion co-registration, to measure the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor, dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) availability. Fifteen normally behaving dogs were used as reference group. Significantly lower 5-HT2A receptor radioligand availability in frontal and temporal cortices (bilateral) was observed. Further, in 78% of the compulsive dogs abnormal DAT ratios in left and right striatum were demonstrated. Interestingly, both increased and decreased DAT ratios were observed. Finally, significantly lower subcortical perfusion and (hypo) thalamic SERF availability were observed in the compulsive dogs. This study provides evidence for imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in the pathophysiology of compulsions in dogs. The similarities with the altered neurotransmission in human OCD provide construct validity for this non-induced, natural canine model, suggesting its usefulness for future investigations of the pathophysiology of human OCD as well as the effectiveness of psychopharmacological interventions.

428,426,"Researchers employing Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) imaging have consistently indentified old normal control (oNC) subjects with elevated tracer uptake, suggesting the presence of beta-amyloid deposition in these individuals. However, a consensus regarding the level at which PIB reveals a biologically meaningful signal does not exist (ie. an appropriate cutoff value for PIB positivity remains unclear). In this exploratory study, we sought to investigate the range of PIB distribution volume ratio (DVR) values present in our oNC cohort (N = 75, age range = 58-97). oNC subjects were classified based on global PIB index values (average DVR across prefrontal, parietal, lateral temporal and cingulate cortices) by employing two approaches: (1) an iterative outlier approach that revealed a cutoff value of 1.16 (IO-cutoff) and (2) an approach using data from a sample of young normal control subjects (N = 11, age range = 20-30) that yielded a cutoff value of 1.08 (yNC-cutoff). oNC subjects falling above the IO-cutoff had values similar to AD subjects (""PIB+"", 15%). Subjects falling between the 2 cutoffs were considered to have ambiguous PIB status (""Ambig"", 20%) and the remaining oNC were considered ""PIB-"" (65%). Additional measures capturing focal DVR magnitude and extent of elevated DVR values were consistent with the classification scheme using PIB index values, and revealed evidence for elevated DVR values in a subset of PIB- oNC subjects. Furthermore, there were a greater proportion of ambiguously elevated values compared to low values, and these elevated values were present in regions known to show amyloid deposition. The analyses presented in this study, in conjunction with recently published pathological data, suggest a biological relevance of slight PIB elevations in aging. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

429,427,"Region of Interest (ROI) longitudinal studies have detected progressive gray matter (GM) volume reductions in patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FESZ). However, there are only a few longitudinal voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies, and these have been limited in ability to detect relationships between volume loss and symptoms, perhaps because of methodologic issues. Nor have previous studies compared and validated VBM results with manual Region of Interest (ROI) analysis. In the present VBM study, high-dimensional warping and individualized baseline-rescan templates were used to evaluate longitudinal volume changes within subjects and compared with longitudinal manual ROI analysis on the same subjects. VBM evaluated thirty-three FESZ and thirty-six matched healthy control subjects (HC) at baseline (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally evaluated 21 FESZ and 23 HC after an average of 1.5 years from baseline scans. Correlation analyses detected the relationship between changes in regional GM volumes in FESZ and clinical symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, as well as cognitive function as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination. At baseline, patients with FESZ had significantly smaller GM volume compared to HC in some regions including the left superior temporal gyrus (STG). On rescan after 1.5 years, patients showed significant GM volume reductions compared with HC in the left STG including Heschl's gyrus, and in widespread brain neocortical regions of frontal, parietal, and limbic regions including the cingulate gyrus. FESZ showed an association of positive symptoms and volume loss in temporal (especially STG) and frontal regions, and negative symptoms and volume loss in STG and frontal regions. Worse cognitive function was linked to widespread volume reduction, in frontal, temporal and parietal regions. The validation VBM analyses showed results similar to our previous ROI findings for STG and cingulate gyrus. We conclude FESZ show widespread, progressive GM volume reductions in many brain regions. Importantly, these reductions are directly associated with a worse clinical course. Congruence with ROI analyses suggests the promise of this longitudinal VBM methodology.

430,428,"Schizophrenia is characterized by lowered efficiency in distributed information processing, as indicated by research that identified a disrupted small-world functional network. However, whether the dysconnection manifested by the disrupted small-world functional network is reflected in underlying anatomical disruption in schizophrenia remains unresolved. This study examined the topological properties of human brain anatomical networks derived from diffusion tensor imaging in patients with schizophrenia and in healthy controls. We constructed the weighted brain anatomical network for each of 79 schizophrenia patients and for 96 age and gender matched healthy subjects using diffusion tensor tractography and calculated the topological properties of the networks using a graph theoretical method. The topological properties of the patients' anatomical networks were altered, in that global efficiency decreased but local efficiency remained unchanged. The deleterious effects of schizophrenia on network performance appear to be localized as reduced regional efficiency in hubs such as the frontal associative cortices, the paralimbic/limbic regions and a subcortical structure (the left putamen). Additionally, scores on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale correlated negatively with efficient network properties in schizophrenia. These findings suggest that complex brain network analysis may potentially be used to detect an imaging biomarker for schizophrenia. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

431,429,"Chemical exchange between water and labile protons from amino-acids, proteins and other molecules can be exploited to provide tissue contrast with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Using an off-resonance Spin-Locking (SL) scheme for signal preparation is advantageous because the image contrast can be tuned to specific exchange rates by adjusting SL pulse parameters. While the amide-proton transfer (APT) contrast is obtained optimally with steady-state preparation, using a low power and long irradiation pulse, image contrast from the faster amine-water proton exchange (APEX) is optimized in the transient state with a higher power and a shorter SL pulse. Our phantom experiments show that the APEX contrast is sensitive to protein and amino acid concentration, as well as pH. In vivo 9.4-T SL MRI data of rat brains with irradiation parameters optimized to slow exchange rates have a sharp peak at 3.5 ppm and also broad peak at -2 to -5 ppm, inducing negative contrast in APT-weighted images, while the APEX image has large positive signal resulting from a weighted summation of many different amine-groups. Brain ischemia induced by cardiac arrest decreases pure APT signal from similar to 1.7% to similar to 0%, and increases the APEX signal from similar to 8% to similar to 16%. In the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, the APEX signal shows different spatial and temporal patterns with large inter-animal variations compared to APT and water diffusion maps. Because of the similarity between the chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and SL techniques, APEX contrast can also be obtained by a CEST approach using similar irradiation parameters.

We build this model using multiple layers, corresponding to cortical lamina in the real cortical manifold. These layers correspond to the populations considered in classical (Jansen and Rit) neural mass models.

433,431,"The central question of the relationship between structure and function in the human brain is still not well understood. In order to investigate this fundamental relationship we create functional probabilistic maps from a large set of mapping experiments and compare the location of functionally localised regions across subjects using different whole-brain alignment schemes. To avoid the major problems associated with meta-analysis approaches, all subjects are scanned using the same paradigms, the same scanner and the same analysis pipeline. We show that an advanced, curvature driven cortex based alignment (CBA) scheme largely removes macro-anatomical variability across subjects. Remaining variability in the observed spatial location of functional regions, thus, reflects the ""true"" functional variability, i.e. the quantified variability is a good estimator of the underlying structural-functional correspondence. After localising 13 widely studied functional areas, we found a large variability in the degree to which functional areas respect macro-anatomical boundaries across the cortex. Some areas, such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) are strongly bound to a macro-anatomical location. Fusiform face area (FFA) on the other hand, varies in its location along the length of the fusiform gyrus even though the gyri themselves are well aligned across subjects. Language areas were found to vary greatly across subjects whilst a high degree of overlap was observed in sensory and motor areas. The observed differences in functional variability for different specialised areas suggest that a more complete estimation of the structure-function relationship across the whole cortex requires further empirical studies with an expanded test battery.

Ninety-six subjects identified threat-related objects concealed in naturalistic virtual surroundings used in real-world training. A variety of brain networks were found using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected at different stages of learning, with two of these networks focused in right inferior frontal and right parietal cortex.

This difference in performance increased to a factor of two after a one-hour delay. A dose response effect of current strength on learning was also found. Taken together, these brain imaging and stimulation studies suggest that right frontal and parietal cortex are involved in learning to identify concealed objects in naturalistic surroundings.

Relative to individuals with the common epsilon 3/epsilon 3 genotype, carriers of the epsilon 4 allele are at increased risk of developing AD, while carriers of the epsilon 2 allele appear to be protected against the disease. However, we recently reported that in a sample of cognitively healthy adults, both epsilon 4 and epsilon 2 carriers showed nearly identical changes in the pattern of fMRI activity during memory and non-memory tasks, relative to epsilon 3 homozygotes. These findings suggest that the effects of APOE on brain function are not tightly linked to the effects of this gene on AD risk. Here we test the hypothesis that APOE has an intrinsic effect on the brain's functional networks. Resting-state fMRI was used to compare the pattern of functional connectivity of a variety of resting-state networks between 77 cognitively healthy participants aged 32 to 55 with different APOE genotypes (23 epsilon 2/epsilon 3, 20 epsilon 3/epsilon 3, 26 epsilon 3/epsilon 4, and 8 epsilon 4/epsilon 4).

In this fMRI study we examined the neural networks involved in social exclusion and subsequent fairness considerations across adolescent development. Participants from 3 age groups (10-12, 14-16 and 19-21 year olds) participated in the study and performed two tasks; first, participants played Cyberball to induce feelings of social inclusion and exclusion, followed by a Dictator game in which participants were asked to divide coins between themselves and the players who previously included or excluded them. Results revealed a network of regions associated with social exclusion, which involve the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), subgenual ACC and the lateral PFC, as well as the insula and the dorsal ACC. Although social exclusion generated strong distress for all age groups, 10-12 year olds showed increased activity in the subgenual ACC in the exclusion game, which has been associated in previous studies with negative affective processing. Results of the Dictator game revealed that all age groups selectively punished the excluders by making lower offers. These offers were associated with activation in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the lateral PFC. Age comparisons revealed that adults showed additional activity in the insula and dorsal ACC when making offers to the excluders. The results are discussed in the light of recent findings on neural networks involved in social exclusion and the development of social brain regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we have applied a specific attentional task to simply measure the performance of the participants with different levels of meditation experience, rather than evaluating meditation practice per se or task performance during meditation. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of regular meditators and non-meditators during an fMRI adapted Stroop Word-Colour Task (SWCT), which requires attention and impulse control, using a block design paradigm. We selected 20 right-handed regular meditators and 19 non-meditators matched for age, years of education and gender. Participants had to choose the colour (red, blue or green) of single words presented visually in three conditions: congruent, neutral and incongruent. Non-meditators showed greater activity than meditators in the right medial frontal, middle temporal, precentral and postcentral gyri and the lentiform nucleus during the incongruent conditions. No regions were more activated in meditators relative to non-meditators in the same comparison. Non-meditators showed an increased pattern of brain activation relative to regular meditators under the same behavioural performance level. This suggests that meditation training improves efficiency, possibly via improved sustained attention and impulse control. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, some normal individuals do not experience the illusion, reporting that the stimulus sounds the same with or without visual input. Converging evidence suggests that the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) is critical for audiovisual integration during speech perception. We used blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) to measure brain activity as McGurk perceivers and non-perceivers were presented with congruent audiovisual syllables, McGurk audiovisual syllables, and non-McGurk incongruent syllables. The inferior frontal gyrus showed an effect of stimulus condition (greater responses for incongruent stimuli) but not susceptibility group, while the left auditory cortex showed an effect of susceptibility group (greater response in susceptible individuals) but not stimulus condition. Only one brain region, the left STS, showed a significant effect of both susceptibility and stimulus condition. The amplitude of the response in the left STS was significantly correlated with the likelihood of perceiving the McGurk effect: a weak STS response meant that a subject was less likely to perceive the McGurk effect, while a strong response meant that a subject was more likely to perceive it. These results suggest that the left STS is a key locus for interindividual differences in speech perception. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

440,438,"Recent genetic and proteomic studies demonstrate that clusterin/apolipoprotein-J is associated with risk, pathology, and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our main aim was to examine associations between plasma clusterin concentration and longitudinal changes in brain volume in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A secondary objective was to examine associations between peripheral concentration of clusterin and its concentration in the brain within regions that undergo neuropathological changes in AD. Non-demented individuals (N=139; mean baseline age 70.5 years) received annual volumetric MRI (912 MRI scans in total) over a mean six-year interval. Sixteen participants (92 MRI scans in total) were diagnosed during the course of the study with amnestic MCI. Clusterin concentration was assayed by ELISA in plasma samples collected within a year of the baseline MRI. Mixed effects regression models investigated whether plasma clusterin concentration was associated with rates of brain atrophy for control and MCI groups and whether these associations differed between groups. In a separate autopsy sample of individuals with AD (N = 17) and healthy controls (N = 4), we examined the association between antemortem clusterin concentration in plasma and postmortem levels in the superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus and cerebellum. The associations of plasma clusterin concentration with rates of change in brain volume were significantly different between MCI and control groups in several volumes including whole brain, ventricular CSF, temporal gray matter as well as parahippocampal, superior temporal and cingulate gyri. Within the MCI but not control group, higher baseline concentration of plasma clusterin was associated with slower rates of brain atrophy in these regions. In the combined autopsy sample of AD and control cases, representing a range of severity in AD pathology, we observed a significant association between clusterin concentration in the plasma and that in the superior temporal gyrus. Our findings suggest that clusterin, a plasma protein with roles in amyloid clearance, complement inhibition and apoptosis, is associated with rate of brain atrophy in MCI. Furthermore, peripheral concentration of clusterin also appears to reflect its concentration within brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology. These findings in combination suggest an influence of this multi-functional protein on early stages of progression in AD pathology.

441,439,"One of our highest evolved functions as human beings is our capacity to switch between multiple tasks effectively. A body of research has identified a distributed frontoparietal network of brain regions which contribute to task switching. However, relatively less is known about whether some brain regions may contribute to switching in a domain-general manner while others may be more preferential for different kinds of switching. To explore this issue, we conducted three meta-analyses focusing on different types of task switching frequently used in the literature (perceptual, response, and context switching), and created a conjunction map of these distinct switch types. A total of 36 switching studies with 562 activation coordinates were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation method. Common areas associated with switching across switch type included the inferior frontal junction and posterior parietal cortex. In contrast, domain-preferential activation was observed for perceptual switching in the dorsal portion of the premotor cortex and for context switching in frontopolar cortex. Our results suggest that some regions within the frontoparietal network contribute to domain-general switching processes while others contribute to more domain-preferential processes, according to the type of task switch performed.

442,440,"Recent reports demonstrate the anti-correlated behaviors between the default (DF) and the dorsal attention (DA) networks. We aimed to investigate the roles of the frontal parietal control (FPC) network in regulating the two anti-correlated networks through three experimental conditions, including resting, continuous self-paced/attended sequential finger tapping (FT), and natural movie watching (MW), respectively. The two goal-directed tasks were chosen to engage either one of the two competing networksFT for DA whereas MW for default. We hypothesized that FPC will selectively augment/suppress either network depending on how the task targets the specific network; FPC will positively correlate with the target network, but negatively correlate with the network anti-correlated with the target network. We further hypothesized that significant causal links from FPC to both DA and DF are present during all three experimental conditions, supporting the initiative regulating role of FPC over the two opposing systems. Consistent with our hypotheses, FPC exhibited a significantly higher positive correlation with DA (P = 0.0095) whereas significantly more negative correlation with default (P = 0.0025) during FT when compared to resting. Completely opposite to that observed during FT, the FPC was significantly anti-correlated with DA (P = 2.1e-6) whereas positively correlated with default (P = 0.0035) during MW. Furthermore, extensive causal links from FPC to both DA and DF were observed across all three experimental states.

443,441,"Objectives: To investigate the functionstructure relationship of white matter within different stages of Huntington's disease (HD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Experimental design: From the TRACK-HD study, an early stage HD group and a premanifest gene carrier group (PMGC) were age-matched to two healthy control groups; all underwent 3-T MRI scanning of the brain. Region of interest (ROI) segmentation of the corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and sensorimotor cortex was applied, and the apparent fiber pathways of these regions were analyzed. Functional measures of motor, oculomotor, cognition, and behavior were correlated to DTI measures. Principle observations: In PMGC versus controls, higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was seen in white matter pathways of the sensorimotor cortex (P < 0.01) and in the ROI of corpus callosum (P < 0.017). In early HD, fiber tract analysis showed higher ADC in pathways of the corpus callosum, thalamus, sensorimotor, and prefrontal region (P < 0.01). ROI analysis showed higher diffusivity in the corpus callosum and caudate nucleus (P < 0.017). Motor, oculomotor, cognition, and probability of onset within 2 and 5 years, correlated well with ADC measures of the corpus callosum (P < 0.01 P < 0.005), sensorimotor (P < 0.01 P < 0.005), and prefrontal region (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Disturbances in the white matter connections of the sensorimotor cortex can be demonstrated not only in manifest HD but also in premanifest gene carriers. Connectivity measures are well related to clinical functioning. DTI measures can be regarded as a potential biomarker for HD, due to their ability to objectify changes in brain structures and their role within brain networks. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

444,442,We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate dysfunction in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders and psychopathic traits during a moral judgment task. Fourteen adolescents with psychopathic traits and 14 healthy controls were assessed using fMRI while they categorized illegal and legal behaviors in a moral judgment implicit association task. fMRI data were then analyzed using random-effects analysis of variance and functional connectivity. Youths with psychopathic traits showed reduced amygdala activity when making judgments about legal actions and reduced functional connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during task performance. These results suggest that psychopathic traits are associated with amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction. This dysfunction may relate to previous findings of disrupted moral judgment in this population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As cognitive control deficits may influence the success of treatment for addiction, we sought to help clarify the neural correlates of this deficit. MA-dependent (n = 10, abstinent 4-7 days) and control subjects (n = 18) performed a color-word Stroop task, which requires cognitive control, during functional MRI (fMRI). The task included a condition in which participants were required to respond to one stimulus dimension while ignoring another conflicting dimension, and another condition without conflict. We compared the groups on performance and neural activation in the two conditions. MA-dependent subjects made more errors and responded more slowly than controls. Controlling for response times in the incongruent condition, voxel-wise mixed effects analyses (whole-brain corrected) demonstrated that MA-dependent subjects had less activation than control subjects in the right inferior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor cortex/anterior cingulate gyrus and the anterior insular cortex during the incongruent condition only. MA-dependent subjects did not exhibit greater activation in any brain region in either of the Stroop conditions.

446,444,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) detects white matter damage in neuro-psychiatric disorders, but data on reliability of DTI measures across more than two scanners are still missing. In this study we assessed multicenter reproducibility of DTI acquisitions based on a physical phantom as well as brain scans across 16 scanners. In addition, we performed DTI scans in a group of 26 patients with clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 12 healthy elderly controls at one single center. We determined the variability of fractional anisotropy (FA) measures using manually placed regions of interest as well as automated tract based spatial statistics and deformation based analysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) of FA was 6.9% for the physical phantom data. The mean CV across the multicenter brain scans was 14% for tract based statistics, and 29% for deformation based analysis. The degree of variation was higher in less organized fiber tracts. Our findings suggest that a clinical and physical phantom study involving more than two scanners is indispensable to detect potential sources of bias and to reliably estimate effect size in multicenter diagnostic trials using DTI.

447,445,"White matter (WM) has been shown to be affected in elderly patients with major depressive disorders (MDD). There is only limited evidence of WM structural abnormalities in nongeriatric MDD patients. This study investigates WM microstructural integrity in nongeriatric MDD patients recruited as part of the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression clinical trial and establishes the validity of diffusion tensor imaging measures for the investigation of depression. Baseline diffusion tensor imaging data from 29 nongeriatric MDD participants (11 with melancholia) and 39 healthy control participants were used in this analysis. We performed tract-based spatial statistics analyses to evaluate WM microstructural integrity (1) between all healthy controls and all MDD participants, (2) between melancholic and nonmelancholic MDD participants, and (3) between each subgroup (melancholic and nonmelancholic) and controls. Significant WM integrity deficits were seen only for the melancholic MDD participants compared with controls. Compared with controls, melancholic participants showed an average reduction of 7.8% in fractional anisotropy over WM regions associated with the limbic system, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamic projection fibers, corpus callosum, and other association fibers. These fractional anisotropy deficits were also associated with decreased axial and increased radial diffusivity in these WM regions, suggesting a pattern of decreased myelination or other degeneration change. Our findings of WM structural abnormalities associated with the limbic system, the frontal cortex, and the thalamus support the prevailing theory of limbic-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-thalamic dysfunction in depression. Our results also suggest that these deficits are most prominent in the melancholic subtype of MDD. Hum Brain Mapp 32:2161-2171, 2011.

448,446,"Over the last two decades, neuroimaging methods have identified a variety of taste-responsive brain regions. Their precise location, however, remains in dispute. For example, taste stimulation activates areas throughout the insula and overlying operculum, but identification of subregions has been inconsistent. Furthermore, literature reviews and summaries of gustatory brain activations tend to reiterate rather than resolve this ambiguity. Here, we used a new meta-analytic method [activation likelihood estimation (ALE)] to obtain a probability map of the location of gustatory brain activation across 15 studies. The map of activation likelihood values can also serve as a source of independent coordinates for future region-of-interest analyses. We observed significant cortical activation probabilities in: bilateral anterior insula and overlying frontal operculum, bilateral mid dorsal insula and overlying Rolandic operculum, and bilateral posterior insula/parietal operculum/postcentral gyrus, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), right medial OFC, pre-genual anterior cingulate cortex (prACC) and right mediodorsal thalamus. This analysis confirms the involvement of multiple cortical areas within insula and overlying operculum in gustatory processing and provides a functional ""tastemap"" which can be used as an inclusive mask in the data analyses of future studies. In light of this new analysis, we discuss human central processing of gustatory stimuli and identify topics where increased research effort is warranted. Hum Brain Mapp 32:2256-2266, 2011.

451,449,"Despite numerous studies on the role of medial temporal lobe structures in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the magnitude and clinical significance of amygdala atrophy have been relatively sparsely investigated. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare the level of amygdala atrophy to that of the hippocampus in very mild and mild AD subjects in two large samples (Sample 1 n = 90; Sample 2 n = 174). Using a series of linear regression analyses, we investigated whether amygdala atrophy is related to global cognitive functioning (Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes: CDR-SB: Mini Mental State Examination: MMSE) and neuropsychiatric status. Results indicated that amygdala atrophy was comparable to hippocampal atrophy in both samples. MMSE and CDR-SB were strongly related to amygdala atrophy, with amygdala atrophy predicting MMSE scores as well as hippocampal atrophy, but predicting CDR-SB scores less robustly. Amygdala atrophy was related to aberrant motor behavior, with potential relationships to anxiety and irritability. These results suggest that the magnitude of amygdala atrophy is comparable to that of the hippocampus in the earliest clinical stages of AD, and is related to global illness severity. There also appear to be specific relationships between the level of amygdala atrophy and neuropsychiatric symptoms that deserve further investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We analyzed the resting connectivity patterns of the posterior cingulate cortex. Deconvolution was used to evaluate the correlation of resting-state connectivity scores with the white-matter hyperintensities burden.

453,451,"The European Union AddNeuroMed program and the US-based Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are two large multi-center initiatives designed to collect and validate biomarker data for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both initiatives use the same MRI data acquisition scheme. The current study aims to compare and combine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the two study cohorts using an automated image analysis pipeline and a multivariate data analysis approach. We hypothesized that the two cohorts would show similar patterns of atrophy, despite demographic differences and could therefore be combined. MRI scans were analyzed from a total of 1074 subjects (AD = 295, MCI = 444 and controls = 335) using Freesurfer, an automated segmentation scheme which generates regional volume and regional cortical thickness measures which were subsequently used for multivariate analysis (orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS)). OPLS models were created for the individual cohorts and for the combined cohort to discriminate between AD patients and controls. The ADNI cohort was used as a replication dataset to validate the model created for the AddNeuroMed cohort and vice versa. The combined cohort model was used to predict conversion to AD at baseline of MCI subjects at 1 year follow-up. The AddNeuroMed, the ADNI and the combined cohort showed similar patterns of atrophy and the predictive power was similar (between 80 and 90%). The combined model also showed potential in predicting conversion from MCI to AD, resulting in 71% of the MCI converters (MCI-c) from both cohorts classified as AD-like and 60% of the stable MCI subjects (MCI-s) classified as control-like.

454,452,"In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), knowledge of the distribution of the induced electric field is fundamental for a better understanding of the position and extent of the stimulated brain region. However, the different tissue types and the varying fibre orientation in the brain tissue result in an inhomogeneous and anisotropic conductivity distribution and distort the electric field in a non-trivial way. Here, the field induced by a figure-8 coil is characterized in detail using finite element calculations and a geometrically accurate model of an individual head combined with high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging for conductivity mapping. It is demonstrated that the field strength is significantly enhanced when the currents run approximately perpendicular to the local gyral orientation. Importantly, the spatial distribution of this effect differs distinctly between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM): While the field in GM is selectively enhanced at the gyral crowns and lips, high field strengths can still occur rather deep in WM. Taking the anisotropy of brain tissue into account tends to further boost this effect in WM. but not in GM. Spatial variations in the WM anisotropy affect the local field strength in a systematic way and result in localized increases of up to 40% (on average similar to 7% for coil orientations perpendicular to the underlying gyri).

We suggest that these effects might create hot spots in WM that might contribute to the excitation of WM structures by TMS. However, our results also demonstrate the necessity of using realistic nerve models in the future to allow for more definitive conclusions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

455,453,"The human inferior parietal lobule (IPL) is a multimodal brain region, subdivided in several cytoarchitectonic areas which are involved in neural networks related to spatial attention, language, and higher motor processing. Tracer studies in macaques revealed differential connectivity patterns of IPL areas as the respective structural basis. Evidence for comparable differential fibre tracts of human IPL is lacking. Here. anatomical connectivity of five cytoarchitectonic human IPL areas to 64 cortical targets was investigated using probabilistic tractography. Connection likelihood was assessed by evaluating the number of traces between seed and target against the distribution of traces from that seed to voxels in the same distance as the target. The main fibre tract pattern shifted gradually from rostral to caudal IPL: Rostral areas were predominantly connected to somatosensory and superior parietal areas while caudal areas more strongly connected with auditory, anterior temporal and higher visual cortices. All IPL areas were strongly connected with inferior frontal, insular and posterior temporal areas. These results showed striking similarities with connectivity patterns in macaques, providing further evidence for possible homologies between these two species. This shift in fibre tract pattern supports a differential functional involvement of rostra! (higher motor functions) and caudal IPL (spatial attention). with probable overlapping language involvement. The differential functional involvement of IPL areas was further supported by hemispheric asymmetries of connection patterns which showed left-right differences especially with regard to connections to sensorimotor, inferior frontal and temporal areas.

456,454,"This paper is about the fitting or inversion of dynamic causal models (DCMs) of fMRI time series. It tries to establish the validity of stochastic DCMs that accommodate random fluctuations in hidden neuronal and physiological states. We compare and contrast deterministic and stochastic DCMs, which do and do not ignore random fluctuations or noise on hidden states. We then compare stochastic DCMs, which do and do not ignore conditional dependence between hidden states and model parameters (generalised filtering and dynamic expectation maximisation, respectively). We first characterise state-noise by comparing the log evidence of models with different a priori assumptions about its amplitude, form and smoothness. Face validity of the inversion scheme is then established using data simulated with and without state-noise to ensure that DCM can identify the parameters and model that generated the data. Finally, we address construct validity using real data from an fMRI study of internet addiction. Our analyses suggest the following. (i) The inversion of stochastic causal models is feasible, given typical fMRI data. (ii) State-noise has nontrivial amplitude and smoothness. (iii) Stochastic DCM has face validity, in the sense that Bayesian model comparison can distinguish between data that have been generated with high and low levels of physiological noise and model inversion provides veridical estimates of effective connectivity. (iv) Relaxing conditional independence assumptions can have greater construct validity, in terms of revealing group differences not disclosed by variational schemes. Finally, we note that the ability to model endogenous or random fluctuations on hidden neuronal (and physiological) states provides a new and possibly more plausible perspective on how regionally specific signals in fMRI are generated.

457,455,"Exact timing is essential for functional MRI data analysis. Datasets are commonly measured using repeated 20 imaging methods, resulting in a temporal offset between slices. To compensate for this timing difference, slice-timing correction (i.e. temporal data interpolation) has been used as an fMRI pre-processing step for more than fifteen years. However, there has been an ongoing debate about the effectiveness and applicability of this method. This paper presents the first elaborated analysis of the impact of the slice-timing effect on simulated data for different fMRI paradigms and measurement parameters, taking into account data noise and smoothing effects. Here we show, depending on repetition time and paradigm design, slice-timing effects can significantly impair fMRI results and slice-timing correction methods can successfully compensate for these effects and therefore increase the robustness of the data analysis.

Previous studies have suggested that the abnormal brain activity may happen not only during performance of self-initiated movements but also in the before movement (baseline or resting) state. In the current study, we investigated the functional connectivity of brain networks in the resting state in PD. We chose the rostral supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) as ""seed"" regions, because the pre-SMA is important in motor preparation, whereas the M1 is critical in motor execution. FMRIs were acquired in 18 patients and 18 matched controls. We found that in the resting state, the pattern of connectivity with both the pre-SMA or the M1 was changed in PD. Connectivity with the pre-SMA in patients with PD compared to normal subjects was increased connectivity to the right M1 and decreased to the left putamen, right insula, right premotor cortex, and left inferior parietal lobule. We only found stronger connectivity in the M1 with its own local region in patients with PD compared to controls. Our findings demonstrate that the interactions of brain networks are abnormal in PD in the resting state. There are more connectivity changes of networks related to motor preparation and initiation than to networks of motor execution in PD. We postulate that these disrupted connections indicate a lack of readiness for movement and may be partly responsible for difficulty in initiating movements in PD. Hum Brain Mapp 32:1443-1457, 2011.

461,458,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can up- and down-regulate cortical excitability depending on current direction, however our abilities to measure brain-tissue effects of the stimulation and its after-effects have been limited so far. We used regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a surrogate measure of brain activity, to examine regional brain-tissue and brain-network effects during and after tDCS. We varied the polarity (anodal and cathodal) as well as the current strength (0.8 to 2.0 mA) of the stimulation. Fourteen healthy subjects were randomized into receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation (two subjects received both, one week apart) while undergoing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) in the MRI scanner with an alternating off-on sampling paradigm. The stimulating, MRI-compatible electrode was placed over the right motor region and the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital region. SPM5 was used to process and extract the rCBF data using a 10 mm spherical volume of interest (VOI) placed in the motor cortex directly underneath the stimulating scalp electrode. Anodal stimulation induced a large increase (17.1%) in rCBF during stimulation, which retumed to baseline after the current was turned off, but exhibited an increase in rCBF again in the post-stimulation period. Cathodal stimulation induced a smaller increase (5.6%) during stimulation, a significant decrease compared to baseline (-6.5%) after cessation, and a continued decrease in the post-stimulation period. These changes in rCBF were all significant when compared to the pre-stimulation baseline or to a control region. Furthermore, for anodal stimulation, there was a significant correlation between current strength and the increase in rCBF in the on-period relative to the pre-stimulation baseline. The differential rCBF after-effects of anodal (increase in resting state rCBF) and cathodal (decrease in resting state rCBF) tDCS support findings of behavioral and cognitive aftereffects after cathodal and anodal tDCS. We also show that tDCS not only modulates activity in the brain region directly underlying the stimulating electrode but also in a network of brain regions that are functionally related to the stimulated area.

462,459,"Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a clinically feasible extension of diffusion tensor imaging that probes restricted water diffusion in biological tissues using magnetic resonance imaging. Here we provide a physically meaningful interpretation of DKI metrics in white matter regions consisting of more or less parallel aligned fiber bundles by modeling the tissue as two non-exchanging compartments, the intra-axonal space and extra-axonal space. For the b-values typically used in DKI, the diffusion in each compartment is assumed lobe anisotropic Gaussian and characterized by a diffusion tensor. The principal parameters of interest for the model include the intra- and extra-axonal diffusion tensors, the axonal water fraction and the tortuosity of the extra-axonal space. A key feature is that these can be determined directly from the diffusion metrics conventionally obtained with DKI. For three healthy young adults, the model parameters are estimated from the DKI metrics and shown to be consistent with literature values. In addition, as a partial validation of this DKI-based approach, we demonstrate good agreement between the DKI-derived axonal water fraction and the slow diffusion water fraction obtained from standard biexponential fitting to high b-value diffusion data. Combining the proposed WM model with DKI provides a convenient method for the clinical assessment of white matter in health and disease and could potentially provide important information on neurodegenerative disorders.

463,460,"Calibrated blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging, a technique used to measure changes in cerebral O-2 metabolism, depends on an accurate model of how the BOLD signal is affected by the mismatch between changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of O-2 (CMRO2). However, other factors such as the cerebral blood volume (CBV) distribution at rest and with activation also affect the BOLD signal. The Davis model originally proposed for calibrated BOLD studies (Davis et al., 1998) is widely used because of its simplicity, but it assumes CBV changes are uniformly distributed across vascular compartments, neglects intravascular signal changes, and ignores blood-tissue signal exchange effects as CBV increases and supplants tissue volume. More recent studies suggest that venous CBV changes are smaller than arterial changes, and that intravascular signal changes and CBV exchange effects can bias estimated CMRO2. In this paper, recent experimental results for the relationship between deoxyhemoglobin and BOLD signal changes are integrated in order to simulate the BOLD signal in detail by expanding a previous model to include a tissue compartment and three blood compartments rather than only the venous blood compartment. The simulated data were then used to test the accuracy of the Davis model of calibrated BOLD, demonstrating that the errors in estimated CMRO2 responses across the typical CBF-CMRO2 coupling range are modest despite the simplicity of the assumptions underlying the original derivation of the model. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the model can be improved by abandoning the original physical meaning of the two parameters alpha and beta and treating them as adjustable parameters that capture several physical effects. For a 3 Tesla field and a dominant arterial volume change with activation, the accuracy of the Davis model is improved with new values of alpha = 0.14 and beta = 0.91. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

464,461,"We present here the most comprehensive analysis to date of neuroaesthetic processing by reporting the results of voxel-based meta-analyses of 93 neuroimaging studies of positive-valence aesthetic appraisal across four sensory modalities. The results demonstrate that the most concordant area of activation across all four modalities is the right anterior insula, an area typically associated with visceral perception, especially of negative valence (disgust, pain, etc.). We argue that aesthetic processing is, at its core, the appraisal of the valence of perceived objects. This appraisal is in no way limited to artworks but is instead applicable to all types of perceived objects. Therefore, one way to naturalize aesthetics is to argue that such a system evolved first for the appraisal of objects of survival advantage, such as food sources, and was later co-opted in humans for the experience of artworks for the satisfaction of social needs.

467,464,"Very little is currently known about the cerebral characteristics that underlie the complex processes of meditation as only a limited number of studies have addressed this topic. Research exploring structural connectivity in meditation practitioners is particularly rare. We thus acquired diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of high angular and spatial resolution and used atlas-based tract mapping methods to investigate white matter fiber characteristics in a well-matched sample of long-term meditators and controls (n = 54). A broad field mapping approach estimated the fractional anisotropy (FA) for twenty different fiber tracts (i.e., nine tracts in each hemisphere and two inter-hemispheric tracts) that were subsequently used as dependent measures. Results showed pronounced structural connectivity in meditators compared to controls throughout the entire brain within major projection pathways, commissural pathways, and association pathways. The largest group differences were observed within the corticospinal tract, the temporal component of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus. While cross-sectional studies represent a good starting point for elucidating possible links between meditation and white matter fiber characteristics, longitudinal studies will be necessary to determine the relative contribution of nature and nurture to enhanced structural connectivity in long-term meditators.

468,465,"There is mounting evidence that mindfulness meditation is beneficial for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, yet little is known regarding the neural mechanisms through which mindfulness modulates emotional responses. Thus, a central objective of this functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness on the neural responses to emotionally laden stimuli. Another major goal of this study was to examine the impact of the extent of mindfulness training on the brain mechanisms supporting the processing of emotional stimuli. Twelve experienced (with over 1000 h of practice) and 10 beginner meditators were scanned as they viewed negative, positive, and neutral pictures in a mindful state and a non-mindful state of awareness. Results indicated that the Mindful condition attenuated emotional intensity perceived from pictures, while brain imaging data suggested that this effect was achieved through distinct neural mechanisms for each group of participants. For experienced meditators compared with beginners, mindfulness induced a deactivation of default mode network areas (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) across all valence categories and did not influence responses in brain regions involved in emotional reactivity during emotional processing. On the other hand, for beginners relative to experienced meditators, mindfulness induced a down-regulation of the left amygdala during emotional processing. These findings suggest that the long-term practice of mindfulness leads to emotional stability by promoting acceptance of emotional states and enhanced present-moment awareness, rather than by eliciting control over low-level affective cerebral systems from higher-order cortical brain regions. These results have implications for affect-related psychological disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

469,466,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research suggests that the ventral striatum (VS)/nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and broader mesocorticolimbic dopamine system mediate aspects of reward processing from expectation of reward to pleasantness experienced upon reward attainment. In parallel, research utilizing event-related potentials (ERP) indicates that the feedback negativity (FN) is sensitive to reward vs. non-reward feedback and outcome expectation. The FN has been source localized to the mPFC and dorsal striatum, and converging evidence suggests that the FN reflects reward processing in the mesocorticolimbic system. However, the extent to which ERP and fMRI measures of reward processing are correlated has yet to be explored within the same individuals. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the convergence between fMRI (i.e., VS and mPFC) and ERP (i.e., FN) measures of reward processing in forty-two participants who completed counterbalanced fMRI and ERP sessions while performing the same monetary gambling task. For the Win>Loss comparison, fMRI activation in the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit including the VS and mPFC was positively correlated with the FN. Here, we demonstrate that monetary gains activate the VS, mPFC, caudate, amygdala, and orbital frontal cortex, enhance the FN ERP component within 300 ms post feedback, and that these measures are related. Thus, fMRI and ERP measures provide complementary information about mesocorticolimbic activity during reward processing, which may be useful in assessing pathological reward sensitivity.

470,467,"Cognitive abilities such as Theory of Mind (ToM), and more generally mentalizing competences, are central to human sociality. Neuroimaging has associated these abilities with specific brain regions including temporoparietal junction, superior temporal sulcus, frontal pole, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Previous studies have shown both that mentalizing competence, indexed as the ability to correctly understand others' belief states, is associated with social network size and that social group size is correlated with frontal lobe volume across primate species (the social brain hypothesis). Given this, we predicted that both mentalizing competences and the number of social relationships a person can maintain simultaneously will be a function of gray matter volume in these regions associated with conventional Theory of Mind. We used voxel-based morphometry of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) to test this hypothesis in humans. Specifically, we regressed individuals' mentalizing competences and social network sizes against gray matter volume. This revealed that gray matter volume in bilateral posterior frontal pole and left temporoparietal junction and superior temporal sucus varies parametrically with mentalizing competence. Furthermore, gray matter volume in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral portion of medial frontal gyrus, varied parametrically with both mentalizing competence and social network size, demonstrating a shared neural basis for these very different facets of sociality. These findings provide the first fine-grained anatomical support for the social brain hypothesis. As such, they have important implications for our understanding of the constraints limiting social cognition and social network size in humans, as well as for our understanding of how such abilities evolved across primates.

471,468,"Treatment-refractory depression (TRD) represents a large proportion of the depressive population, yet has seldom been investigated using advanced imaging techniques. To characterize brain dysfunction in TRD, we performed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) on 22 TRD patients, along with 26 matched healthy subjects and 22 patients who were depressed but not treatment-refractory (NDD) as comparison groups. Results were analyzed using a data-driven approach known as Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) analysis which measures the synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signal oscillations within spatially neighboring voxels. Relative to healthy controls, both depressed groups showed high ReHo primarily within temporo-limbic structures, and more widespread low ReHo in frontal, parietal, posterior fusiform cortices, and caudate. TRD patients showed more cerebral regions with altered ReHo than did NDD. Moderate but significant correlations between the altered regional ReHo and measures of clinical severity were observed in some identified clusters. These findings shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TRD and demonstrate the feasibility of using ReHo as a research and clinical tool to monitor persistent cerebral dysfunction in depression, although further work is necessary to compare different measures of brain function to elucidate the neural substrates of these ReHo abnormalities.

472,469,"Learning to read in alphabetic orthographies starts with learning a script code consisting of letter-speech sound pairs. Although children know which letters belong to which speech sounds within months, it takes much longer to automatically integrate them into newly constructed audiovisual objects. This extended learning process corresponds with observations that reliable letter and word specific activations in the fusiform cortex also occur relatively late in reading development. The present review discusses electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies of the nature and mechanisms involved in letter-speech sound integration in normal and dyslexic readers. It is demonstrated that letter-speech sound associations do not develop in parallel with visual letter recognition but immediately work in concert to form orthographic-phonological bonds which remain active even in experienced reading. Effective letter-speech sound integration may be necessary for reliable letter recognition to develop. In contrast, it is this basic integration of letters and speech sounds which poses an immediate problem for beginning dyslexic readers, and remains problematic in adult dyslexic readers. It is hypothesized that a specific orthographic-phonological binding deficit may not only act as a proximal cause for reading deficits in dyslexia, but may also explain the notorious lack of reading fluency. Finally, it is suggested that similar integrated audiovisual representations may also exist for larger grain-sizes in the same posterior occipitotemporal/inferoparietal network as identified for orthographic-phonological integration of letters and speech sounds.

473,470,"Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a specific learning disability that affects the acquisition of mathematical skills in children with normal intelligence and age-appropriate school education (prevalence 3-6%). One essential step in the development of mathematical understanding is the formation and automated access to a spatial representation of numbers. Many children with DD show a deficient development of such a mental number line. The present study aimed to develop a computer-based training program to improve the construction and access to the mental number line. Sixteen children with DD aged 8-10 years and 16 matched control children completed the 5-week computer training. All children played the game 15 min a day for 5 days a week. The efficiency of the training was evaluated by means of neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a number line task. In general, children with and without DD showed a benefit from the training indicated by (a) improved spatial representation of numbers and (b) the number of correctly solved arithmetical problems. Regarding group differences in brain activation, children with DD showed less activation in bilateral parietal regions, which reflects neuronal dysfunction in pivotal regions for number processing. Both groups showed reduced recruitment of relevant brain regions for number processing after the training which can be attributed to automatization of cognitive processes necessary for mathematical reasoning. Moreover, results point to a partial remediation of deficient brain activation in dyscalculics after consolidation of acquired and refined number representation. To conclude, the present study represents the first attempt to evaluate a custom-designed training program in a group of dyscalculic children and results indicate that the training leads to an improved spatial representation of the mental number line and a modulation of neural activation, which both facilitate processing of numerical tasks.

In this paper, we aimed to clarify differences between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia by combining fMRI (collected during an auditory oddball task) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. We proposed a fusion method, ""multimodal CCA+ joint ICA"", which increases flexibility in statistical assumptions beyond existing approaches and can achieve higher estimation accuracy. The data collected from 164 participants (62 healthy controls, 54 schizophrenia and 48 bipolar) were extracted into ""features"" (contrast maps for fMRI and fractional anisotropy (FA) for DTI) and analyzed in multiple facets to investigate the group differences for each pair-wised groups and each modality. Specifically, both patient groups shared significant dysfunction in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus, as well as reduced white matter (WM) integrity in anterior thalamic radiation and uncinate fasciculus. Schizophrenia and bipolar subjects were separated by functional differences in medial frontal and visual cortex, as well as WM tracts associated with occipital and frontal lobes. Both patients and controls showed similar spatial distributions in motor and parietal regions, but exhibited significant variations in temporal lobe. Furthermore, there were different group trends for age effects on loading parameters in motor cortex and multiple WM regions, suggesting that brain dysfunction and WM disruptions occurred in identified regions for both disorders. Most importantly, we can visualize an underlying function structure network by evaluating the joint components with strong links between DTI and fMRI.

475,472,"Relational aggression such as social rejection is common within school peer groups. Converging evidence suggests that adolescent females are particularly sensitive to social rejection. We used a novel fMRI adaptation of the Cyberball social rejection paradigm to investigate the neural response to social rejection in 19 mid-adolescent (aged 14-16) and 16 adult female participants. Across all participants, social exclusion (relative to inclusion) elicited a response in bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) extending into ventral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex; and the left ventrolateral PFC (vIPFC); regions that have been associated in previous studies with social evaluation, negative affective processing, and affect regulation respectively. However, the exclusion-related response in right vIPFC, a region associated in previous studies with the regulation of rejection-related distress, was attenuated in adolescents. Within mPFC, greater activation during exclusion vs. inclusion was associated with greater self-reported susceptibility to peer influence in adolescents but not in adults. This suggests that the brain's response to experimentally-induced social rejection relates to adolescent behaviour in real-world social interactions. We speculate about the potential implications of these findings for educational settings. In particular, functional development of affective circuitry during adolescence may influence social interaction within the school peer group. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Depressed subjects had significantly lower gray matter in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (standardized to cerebral parenchyma) after controlling for age and sex.

477,474,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe psychiatric condition of undetermined brain underpinnings, which involves profound emotion regulation deficits and interpersonal impairment. To elucidate biopsychological markers of the disorder, we performed two studies: i.) assessing empathy and social cognition and ii.) measuring the psychophysical properties and functional brain correlates of empathic functioning in a total of fifty-one affected patients and 50 age- and gender-matched controls. In the behavioral study we applied the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET), a new, ecologically valid measure to assess cognitive (i.e., social cognition) and emotional (i.e., empathic concern) empathy to a subset of participants. In the second study, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and skin conductance measurements were performed while participants took a scanner-adapted version of the MET. Patients with BPD showed impairments in cognitive and emotional empathy. Brain responses during cognitive empathy were significantly reduced in patients compared to controls in the left superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STS/STG), where this reduction was associated with levels of intrusive symptomatology in the BPD group. During emotional empathy, patients with BPD exhibited greater brain activity than controls in the right middle insular cortex, a response that was associated with skin conductance responses in the patients. Results indicate that altered functioning of the STS/STG and insula represents pathophysiological mediators for reduced empathy in BPD, with an important role for intrusive symptomatology and levels of arousal. The findings thus support a conceptualization of BPD as involving deficits in both inferring others' mental states and being emotionally attuned to another person. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

To increase the sensitivity, higher field strengths are often employed, since they provide an increased image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, as image SNR increases, the relative contribution of physiological noise to the total time series noise will be greater compared to that from thermal noise. At 7 T, we studied how the physiological noise contribution can be best reduced for EPI time series acquired at three different spatial resolutions (1.1 mm x 1.1 mm x 1.8 mm, 2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm and 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). Applying optimal physiological noise correction methods improved temporal SNR (tSNR) and increased the numbers of significantly activated voxels in fMRI visual activation studies for all sets of acquisition parameters. The most dramatic results were achieved for the lowest spatial resolution, an acquisition parameter combination commonly used in cognitive neuroimaging which requires high functional sensitivity and temporal resolution (i.e. 3 mm isotropic resolution and whole brain image repetition time of 2 s).

While there is a relatively mature literature on post mortem diffusion imaging of animals, human brains have proven more challenging due to their incompatibility with high-performance scanners. This study presents a method for post mortem diffusion imaging of whole, human brains using a clinical 3-Tesla scanner with a 3D segmented EPI spin-echo sequence. Results in eleven brains at 0.94 x 0.94 x 0.94 mm resolution are presented, and in a single brain at 0.73 x 0.73 x 0.73 mm resolution. Region-of-interest analysis of diffusion tensor parameters indicate that these properties are altered compared to in vivo (reduced diffusivity and anisotropy), with significant dependence on post mortem interval (time from death to fixation). Despite these alterations, diffusion tractography of several major tracts is successfully demonstrated at both resolutions. We also report novel findings of cortical anisotropy and partial volume effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

482,479,"Brain alterations are known to be associated with anorexia nervosa (AN) and tend to be distributed across brain structures, with only a few reports describing focal damage. Magnetic resonance images of 21 anorexic patients with different disease duration and 27 control subjects were acquired and compared using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Patients had a significant reduction of total white matter (WM) volume and focal gray matter (GM) atrophy in cerebellum, hypothalamus, caudate nucleus and frontal, parietal and temporal areas. The cerebellum was more affected in patients with longer disease duration, whereas the hypothalamic alterations were more pronounced in patients with shorter food restriction. A correlation with body mass index (BMI) and GM was found in the hypothalamus. Our data demonstrate a diffuse reduction of WM together with focal areas of GM atrophy in AN. The finding of a hypothalamic focal atrophy points to hormonal dysfunction and opens the possibility for a central dysregulation of homeostasis. The involvement of temporoparietal areas could account for body image distortion. Finally, the cerebellar GM atrophy confirms previous findings and seems to be a late consequence of AN that could play a role in the chronic phase of the disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

483,480,"The cingulate cortex is a structurally heterogeneous brain region involved in emotional, cognitive and motor tasks. With the aim of identifying which behavioral domains are associated with the activation of the cingulate cortex, we performed a structure based-meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which assesses statistical significant convergence of neuroimaging studies using the BrainMap database. To map the meta-analytic coactivation maps of the cingulate cortex (MACM), we subdivided the parenchyma along the rostro-caudal axis in 12 bilateral equispaced ROIs. ROIs were not chosen According to previously suggested subdivisions, as to obtain a completely data-driven result. Studies were included with one or more activation coordinates in at least one of the 12 pre-defined ROIs. The meta-analytic connectivity profile and behavioral domains profiles were identified for each ROI. Cluster analysis was then performed on the MACM and behavioral domains to group together ROIs with similar profiles. The results showed that the cingulate cortex can be divided in three clusters according to the MACM parcellation and in four according to the behavioral domain-based parcellation. In addition, a behavioral-domain based meta-analysis was conducted and the spatial consistency of functional connectivity patterns across different domain-related ALE results was evaluated by computing probabilistic maps. These maps identified some portions of the cingulate cortex as involved in several tasks. Our results showed the existence of a more specific functional characterization of some portions of the cingulate cortex but also a great multifunctionality of others. By analyzing a large number of studies, structure based meta-analysis can greatly contribute to new insights in the functional significance of brain activations and in the role of specific brain areas in behavior.

484,481,"Patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often demonstrate impaired interictal attention, even with control of their seizures. No previous study has investigated the brain networks involved in this impairment. We used the continuous performance task (CPT) of attentional vigilance and the repetitive tapping task (RTT), a control motor task, to examine interictal attention in 26 children with CAE and 22 matched healthy controls. Each subject underwent simultaneous 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging-electroencephalography (fMRI-EEG) and CPT/RTT testing. Areas of activation on fMRI during the CPT task were correlated with behavioral performance and used as seed regions for resting functional connectivity analysis. All behavioral measures reflecting inattention were significantly higher in patients. Correlation analysis revealed that impairment on all measures of inattention on the CPT task was associated with decreased medial frontal cortex (MFC) activation during CPT. In addition, analysis of resting functional connectivity revealed an overall decrease within an 'attention network' in patients relative to controls. Patients demonstrated significantly impaired connectivity between the right anterior insula/frontal operculum (In/FO) and MFC relative to controls. Our results suggest that there is impaired function in an attention network comprising anterior In/FO and MFC in patients with CAE.

485,482,"Drug-related stimuli, through conditioning, are thought to acquire incentive motivational properties that code possible reward availability and elicit an attentional bias, possibly through increased ""bottom-up"" neural processing. The processes underlying this attentional bias are considered important in the maintenance of addiction, and crucially, in relapse among substance users attempting to remain abstinent. Equally, impaired ""top-down"" cognitive control may impair the ability to restrain ""bottom-up"" pre-potent behaviours, such as drug use, following exposure to drug-related stimuli. Two experiments sought to identify the neural loci of bottom-up/top-down processing during fMRI. Experiment 1 utilised an attentional bias paradigm to examine the behavioural and neural responses to neutral, emotionally evocative and smoking-related cues in control (n = 13), ex-smoking (n = 10 - abstinent > 12 months) and smoking (n = 13 - mean > 6.5 years of use) groups. Experiment 2 used a go/no-go paradigm to examine the neural correlates of motor response inhibition and error monitoring in the same sample. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that, across conditions, current smokers had significantly less neural activity in cortical but significantly more activity in subcortical areas compared to both controls and ex-smokers. Ex-smokers exhibited more neural activity than both control and smoker groups in prefrontal cortical regions. Similarly. Experiment 2 revealed that smokers had reduced neural activity in prefrontal cortical regions during motor response inhibition compared to controls while ex-smokers demonstrated greater neural activity in prefrontal cortical regions compared to both controls and smokers during error monitoring. The results reveal cortical and subcortical differences between current smokers and controls and a general pattern of increased prefrontal cortical activity in ex-smokers. These findings may suggest that elevated topdown control might be an important characteristic of successful abstinence in individuals formerly dependent on nicotine. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

487,484,"The executive control of voluntary action involves not only choosing from a range of possible actions but also the inhibition of responses as circumstances demand. Recent studies have demonstrated that many clinical populations, such as people with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, exhibit difficulties in inhibitory control. One prefrontal area that has been particularly associated with inhibitory control is the pre-supplementary motor area (Pre-SMA). Here we applied non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over Pre-SMA to test its role in this behavior. tDCS allows for current to be applied in two directions to selectively excite or suppress the neural activity of Pre-SMA. Our results showed that anodal tDCS improved efficiency of inhibitory control. Conversely, cathodal tDCS showed a tendency towards impaired inhibitory control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of non-invasive intervention tDCS altering subjects' inhibitory control. These results further our understanding of the neural bases of inhibitory control and suggest a possible therapeutic intervention method for clinical populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

488,485,"The current study examined the neural correlates associated with local and global inhibitory processes used by bilinguals to resolve interference between competing responses. Two groups of participants completed both blocked and mixed picture naming tasks while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). One group first named a set of pictures in L1, and then named the same pictures in L2. The other group first named pictures in L2, and then in L1. After the blocked naming tasks, both groups performed a mixed language naming task (i.e., naming pictures in either language according to a cue). The comparison between the blocked and mixed naming tasks, collapsed across groups, was defined as the local switching effect, while the comparison between blocked naming in each language was defined as the global switching effect. Distinct patterns of neural activation were found for local inhibition as compared to global inhibition in bilingual word production. Specifically, the results suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) play important roles in local inhibition, while the dorsal left frontal gyrus and parietal cortex are important for global inhibition.

489,486,"Synchronized low-frequency BOLD fluctuations are observed in dissociable large-scale, distributed networks with functional specialization. Two such networks, referred to as the task-positive network (TPN) and the task-negative network (TNN) because they tend to be active or inactive during cognitively demanding tasks, show reproducible anticorrelation of resting BOLD fluctuations after removal of the global brain signal. Because global signal regression mandates that anticorrelated regions to a given seed region must exist, it is unclear whether such anticorrelations are an artifact of global regression or an intrinsic property of neural activity. In this study, we demonstrate from simulated data that spurious anticorrelations are introduced during global regression for any two networks as a linear function of their size. Using actual resting state data, we also show that both the TPN and TNN become anticorrelated with the orbits when soft tissues are included in the global regression algorithm. Finally, we propose a technique using phase-shifted soft tissue regression (PSTCor) that allows improved correction of global physiological artifacts without global regression that shows improved anatomic specificity to global regression but does not show significant network anticorrelations. These results imply that observed anticorrelations between TNN and TPN may be largely or entirely artifactual in the resting state. These results also imply that differences in network anticorrelations attributed to pathophysiological or behavioral states may be due to differences in network size or recruitment rather than actual anticorrelations.

Abnormal myelination leads to a wide range of neurological diseases and developmental disorders. Non-invasive imaging of myelin content is of great clinical importance. The present work demonstrated that loss of myelin in the central nervous system of the shiverer mouse results in a dramatic reduction of magnetic susceptibility in white matter axons. The reduction resulted in a near extinction of susceptibility contrast between gray and white matter. Quantitative magnetic susceptibility imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were conducted on a group of control and shiverer mice at 9.4 T. We measured the resonance frequency distribution of the whole brain for each mouse. Magnetic susceptibility maps were computed and compared between the two groups. It was shown that the susceptibility contrast between gray and white matter was reduced by 96% in the shiverer compared to the controls. Diffusion measurements further confirmed intact fiber pathways in the shiverer mice, ruling out the possibility of axonal injury and its potential contribution to the altered susceptibility. As an autosomal recessive mutation, shiverer is characterized by an almost total lack of central nervous system myelin. Our data provide new evidences indicating that myelin is the predominant source of susceptibility differences between deep gray and white matter observed in magnetic resonance imaging.

491,488,"Despite recent advances in non-invasive brain mapping imaging, the resectability of a given area in a patient harboring a WHO grade II glioma cannot be predicted preoperatively with high reliability, due to mechanisms of functional reorganization. Therefore, intraoperative mapping by direct electrical stimulation remains the gold standard for detection and preservation of eloquent areas during gliorna surgery, because it enables to perform on-line anatomo-functional correlations. To study potentials and limitations of brain plasticity, we gathered 58 postoperative MRI of patients operated on for a WHO grade II glioma under direct electrical cortico-subcortical stimulation. Postoperative images were registered on the MNI template to construct an atlas of functional resectability for which each voxel represents the probability to observe residual non-resectable tumor, that is, non-compensable area. The resulting atlas offers a rigorous framework to identify areas with high plastic potential (i.e. with probabilities of residual tumor close to 0), with low compensatory capabilities (i.e. probabilities of residual tumor close to 1) and with intermediate level of resectability (probability around 0.5). The resulting atlas highlights the utmost importance of preserving a core of connectivity through the main associative pathways, namely, it supports the existence of a ""minimal common brain"" among patients.

Separate meta-analyses of 9 studies with children (age means: 9-11 years) and of 9 studies with adults (age means: 18-30 years) and statistical comparison of these meta-analytic maps did find support for a dysfunction of a left ventral OT region in both children and adults. The findings on a possible predominance of a left TP dysfunction in children were inconclusive. Contrary to expectation, underactivation in superior temporal regions was only found for adults, but not for children. For children, underactivation was found in bilateral inferior parietal regions, but this abnormality was no longer present when foci identified by higher dyslexic task-negative activation (i.e., deactivation in response to reading compared to baseline) were excluded.

494,491,"Over the last 25 years, ""mindblindness"" (deficits in representing mental states) has been one of the primary explanations behind the hallmark social-communication difficulties in autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, highlighting neural systems responsible for mindblindness and their relation to variation in social impairments has remained elusive. In this study we show that one of the neural systems responsible for mindblindness in ASC and its relation to social impairments is the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). Twenty-nine adult males with ASC and 33 age and IQ-matched Controls were scanned with fMRI while making reflective mentalizing or physical judgments about themselves or another person. Regions of interest within mentalizing circuitry were examined for between-group differences in activation during mentalizing about self and other and correlations with social symptom severity. RTPJ was the only mentalizing region that responded atypically in ASC. In Controls. RTPJ was selectively more responsive to mentalizing than physical judgments. This selectivity for mentalizing was not apparent in ASC and generalized across both self and other. Selectivity of RTPJ for mentalizing was also associated wills the degree of reciprocal social impairment in ASC. These results lend support to the idea that RTPJ is one important neural system behind mindblindness in ASC. Understanding the contribution of RTPJ in conjunction with other neural systems responsible for other component processes involved in social cognition will be illuminating in fully explaining the hallmark social-communication difficulties of autism.

Although the exact origin of these mTBI-related disorders is not known, they may be the consequence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Here, we investigated whether MRI at the subacute stage can detect lesions that are associated with poor functional outcome in mTBI by using anatomical images (T-1) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty-three patients with mTBI were investigated and compared with 23 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent an MRI investigation and clinical tests between 7 and 28 days (D15) and between 3 and 4 months (M3) after injury. Patients were divided in two groups of poor outcome (PO) and good outcome (GO), based on their complaints at M3. Groupwise differences in gray matter partial volume between PO patients, GO patients and controls were analyzed using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) from T-1 data at D15. Differences in microstructural architecture were investigated using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and the diffusion images obtained from DTI data at D15. Permutation-based non-parametric testing was used to assess cluster significance at p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. Twelve GO patients and 11 PO patients were identified on the basis of their complaints. In PO patients, gray matter partial volume was significantly lower in several cortical and subcortical regions compared with controls, but did not differ from that of GO patients. No difference in diffusion variables was found between GO and controls. PO patients showed significantly higher mean diffusivity values than both controls and GO patients in the corpus callosum, the right anterior thalamic radiations and the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally. In conclusion, PO patients differed from GO patients by the presence of diffusion changes in long association white matter fiber tracts but not by gray matter partial volume.

Groupwise differences in gray matter partial volume between PO patients, GO patients and controls were analyzed using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) from T-1 data at D15. Differences in microstructural architecture were investigated using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and the diffusion images obtained from DTI data at D15. Permutation-based non-parametric testing was used to assess cluster significance at p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. Twelve GO patients and 11 PO patients were identified on the basis of their complaints. In PO patients, gray matter partial volume was significantly lower in several cortical and subcortical regions compared with controls, but did not differ from that of GO patients. No difference in diffusion variables was found between GO and controls. PO patients showed significantly higher mean diffusivity values than both controls and GO patients in the corpus callosum, the right anterior thalamic radiations and the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally. In conclusion, PO patients differed from GO patients by the presence of diffusion changes in long association white matter fiber tracts but not by gray matter partial volume. These results suggest that DTI at the subacute stage may be a predictive marker of poor outcome in mTBI. Hum Brain Mapp 32:999-1011, 2011.

497,494,"An important question that confronts current research in affective neuroscience as well as in the treatment of emotional disorders is whether it is possible to determine the emotional state of a person based on the measurement of brain activity alone. Here, we first show that an online support vector machine (SVM) can be built to recognize two discrete emotional states, such as happiness and disgust from fMRI signals, in healthy individuals instructed to recall emotionally salient episodes from their lives. We report the first application of real-time head motion correction, spatial smoothing and feature selection based on a new method called Effect mapping. The classifier also showed robust prediction rates in decoding three discrete emotional states (happiness, disgust and sadness) in an extended group of participants. Subjective reports ascertained that participants performed emotion imagery and that the online classifier decoded emotions and not arbitrary states of the brain. Offline whole brain classification as well as region-of-interest classification in 24 brain areas previously implicated in emotion processing revealed that the frontal cortex was critically involved in emotion induction by imagery. We also demonstrate an fMRI-BCI based on real-time classification of BOLD signals from multiple brain regions, for each repetition time (TR) of scanning, providing visual feedback of emotional states to the participant for potential applications in the clinical treatment of dysfunctional affect.

498,495,"Working memory (WM) for auditory information has been thought of as a unitary system, but whether WM for verbal and tonal information relies on the same or different functional neuroarchitectures has remained unknown. This fMRI study examines verbal and tonal WM in both nonmusicians (who are trained in speech, but not in music) and highly trained musicians (who are trained in both domains). The data show that core structures of WM are involved in both tonal and verbal WM (Broca's area, premotor cortex, pre-SMA/SMA, left insular cortex, inferior parietal lobe), although with significantly different structural weightings, in both nonmusicians and musicians. Additionally, musicians activated specific subcomponents only during verbal (right insular cortex) or only during tonal WM (right globus pallidus, right caudate nucleus, and left cerebellum). These results reveal the existence of two WM systems in musicians: A phonological loop supporting rehearsal of phonological information, and a tonal loop supporting rehearsal of tonal information. Differences between groups for tonal WM, and between verbal and tonal WM within musicians, were mainly related to structures involved in controlling, programming and planning of actions, thus presumably reflecting differences in action-related sensorimotor coding of verbal and tonal information.

To optimize the usefulness for neonatal and pediatric care, systematic research, based on quantitative image analysis and functional correlation, is required. Normalization-based image analysis is one of the most effective methods for image quantification and statistical comparison. However, the application of this methodology to neonatal brain MRI scans is rare. Some of the difficulties are the rapid changes in T1 and T2 contrasts and the lack of contrast between brain structures, which prohibits accurate cross-subject image registration.

In this paper, we report the development of neonatal brain atlases with detailed anatomic information derived from DTI and co-registered anatomical MRI. Combined with a diffeomorphic transformation, we were able to normalize neonatal brain images to the atlas space and three-dimensionally parcellate images into 122 regions. The accuracy of the normalization was comparable to the reliability of human raters. This method was then applied to babies of 37-53 post-conceptional weeks to characterize developmental changes of the white matter, which indicated a posterior-to-anterior and a central-to-peripheral direction of maturation.

500,497,"The hippocampus is involved at the onset of the neuropathological pathways leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk of AD. Hippocampal volume has been shown to predict which MCI subjects will convert to AD. Our aim in the present study was to produce a fully automated prognostic procedure, scalable to high throughput clinical and research applications, for the prediction of MCI conversion to AD using 3D hippocampal morphology. We used an automated analysis for the extraction and mapping of the hippocampus from structural magnetic resonance scans to extract 3D hippocampal shape morphology, and we then applied machine learning classification to predict conversion from MCI to AD. We investigated the accuracy of prediction in 103 MCI subjects (mean age 74.1 years) from the longitudinal AddNeuroMed study. Our model correctly predicted MCI conversion to dementia within a year at an accuracy of 80% (sensitivity 77%, specificity 80%), a performance which is competitive with previous predictive models dependent on manual measurements. Categorization of MCI subjects based on hippocampal morphology revealed more rapid cognitive deterioration in MMSE scores (p<0.01) and CERAD verbal memory (p<0.01) in those subjects who were predicted to develop dementia relative to those predicted to remain stable. The pattern of atrophy associated with increased risk of conversion demonstrated initial degeneration in the anterior part of the cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampal subregion. We conclude that automated shape analysis generates sensitive measurements of early neurodegeneration which predates the onset of dementia and thus provides a prognostic biomarker for conversion of MCI to AD.

501,498,"Normal aging is accompanied by various cognitive functional declines. Recent studies have revealed disruptions in the coordination of large-scale functional brain networks such as the default mode network in advanced aging. However, organizational alterations of the structural brain network at the system level in aging are still poorly understood. Here, using cortical thickness, we investigated the modular organization of the cortical structural networks in 102 young and 97 normal aging adults. Brain networks for both cohorts displayed a modular organization overlapping with functional domains such as executive and auditory/language processing. However, compared with the modular organisation of young adults, the aging group demonstrated a significantly reduced modularity that might be indicative of reduced functional segregation in the aging brain. More importantly, the aging brain network exhibited reduced intra-/inter-module connectivity in modules corresponding to the executive function and the default mode network of young adults, which might be associated with the decline of cognitive functions in aging. Finally, we observed age-associated alterations in the regional characterization in terms of their intra/inter-module connectivity. Our results indicate that aging is associated with an altered modular organization in the structural brain networks and provide new evidence for disrupted integrity in the large-scale brain networks that underlie cognition.

502,499,"The ability to detect neuronal activity emanating from deep brain structures such as the hippocampus using magnetoencephalography has been debated in the literature. While a significant number of recent publications reported activations from deep brain structures, others reported their inability to detect such activity even when other detection modalities confirmed its presence. In this article, we relied on realistic simulations to show that both sides of this debate are correct and that these findings are reconcilable. We show that the ability to detect such activations in evoked responses depends on the signal strength, the amount of brain noise background, the experimental design parameters, and the methodology used to detect them. Furthermore, we show that small signal strengths require contrasts with control conditions to be detected, particularly in the presence of strong brain noise backgrounds. We focus on one localization technique, the adaptive spatial filter (beamformer), and examine its strengths and weaknesses in reconstructing hippocampal activations, in the presence of other strong brain sources such as visual activations, and compare the performance of the vector and scalar beamformers under such conditions. We show that although a weight-normalized beamformer combined with a multisphere head model is not biased in the presence of uncorrelated random noise, it can be significantly biased in the presence of correlated brain noise. Furthermore, we show that the vector beamformer performs significantly better than the scalar under such conditions. We corroborate our findings empirically using real data and demonstrate our ability to detect and localize such sources. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 812-827, 2011.

We applied fcMRI to determine if Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training is effective in altering intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Healthy women were randomly assigned to participate in an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training course or an 8-week waiting period. After 8 weeks, fMRI data (1.5 T) was acquired while subjects rested with eyes closed, with the instruction to pay attention to the sounds of the scanner environment. Group independent component analysis was performed to investigate training-related changes in functional connectivity. Significant MBSR-related differences in functional connectivity were found mainly in auditory/salience and medial visual networks. Relative to findings in the control group, MBSR subjects showed (1) increased functional connectivity within auditory and visual networks, (2) increased functional connectivity between auditory cortex and areas associated with attentional and self-referential processes, (3) stronger anticorrelation between auditory and visual cortex, and (4) stronger anticorrelation between visual cortex and areas associated with attentional and self-referential processes. These findings suggest that 8 weeks of mindfulness meditation training alters intrinsic functional connectivity in ways that may reflect a more consistent attentional focus, enhanced sensory processing, and reflective awareness of sensory experience.

504,501,"The Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) is part of the left ventral visual stream that underlies the invariant identification of visual words. It remains debated whether this region is truly selective for words relative to common objects; why this particular part of the visual system is reproducibly engaged in reading; and whether reading expertise also relies on perceptual learning within earlier visual areas. In this fMRI study we matched written words and line-drawings of objects in luminance, contour length and number of features. We then compared them to control images made by scrambling procedures that kept local features intact. Greater responses to written words than to objects were found not only in the VWFA, but also in areas V1/V2 and V3v/V4. Furthermore, by contrasting stimuli reduced either to line junctions (vertices) or to line midsegments, we showed that the VWFA partially overlaps with regions of ventral visual cortex particularly sensitive to the presence of line junctions that are useful for object recognition. Our results indicate that preferential processing of written words can be observed at multiple levels of the visual system. It is possible that responses in early visual areas might be due to some remaining differences between words and controls not eliminated in the present stimuli. However, our results concur with recent comparisons of literates and illiterates and suggest that these early visual activations reflect the effects of perceptual learning under pressure for fast, parallel processing that is more prominent in reading than other visual cognitive processes.

505,502,"Male bonnet monkeys (Macaca radiata) were subjected to the variable foraging demand (VFD) early stress paradigm as infants, MRI scans were completed an average of 4 years later, and behavioral assessments of anxiety and ex-vivo corpus callosum (CC) measurements were made when animals were fully matured. VFD rearing was associated with smaller CC size, CC measurements were found to correlate with fearful behavior in adulthood, and ex-vivo CC assessments showed high consistency with earlier MRI measures. Region of interest (ROI) hippocampus and whole brain voxel-based morphometry assessments were also completed and VFD rearing was associated with reduced hippocampus and inferior and middle temporal gyri volumes. The animals were also characterized according to serotonin transporter genotype (5-HTTLPR), and the effect of genotype on imaging parameters was explored. The current findings highlight the importance of future research to better understand the effects of stress on brain development in multiple regions, including the corpus callosum, hippocampus, and other regions involved in emotion processing.

506,503,"Despite significant advances in the treatment of major depression, there is a high degree of variability in how patients respond to treatment. Approximately 70% of patients show some improvement following standard antidepressant treatment and are classified as having non-refractory depressive disorder (NDD), while the remaining 30% of patients do not respond to treatment and are classified as having refractory depressive disorder (RDD). At present, there are no objective, neurological markers which can be used to identify individuals with depression and predict clinical outcome. We therefore examined the diagnostic and prognostic potential of pre-treatment structural neuroanatomy using support vector machine (SVM). Sixty-one drug-naive adults suffering from depression and 42 healthy volunteers were scanned using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). Patients then received standard antidepressant medication (either tricyclic, typical serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor or typical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Based on clinical outcome, we selected two groups of RDD (n = 23) and NDD (n = 23) patients matched for age, sex and pre-treatment severity of depression. Diagnostic accuracy of gray matter was 67.39% for RDD (p = 0.01) and 76.09% for NDD (p<0.001), while diagnostic accuracy of white matter was 58.70% for RDD (p = 0.13) and 84.65% for NDD (p<0.001). SVM applied to gray matter correctly distinguished between RDD and NDD patients with an accuracy of 69.57% (p = 0.006); in contrast, SVM applied to white matter predicted clinical outcome with an accuracy of 65.22% (p = 0.02). These results indicate that both gray and white matter have diagnostic and prognostic potential in major depression and may provide an initial step towards the use of biological markers to inform clinical treatment. Future studies will benefit from the integration of structural neuroimaging with other imaging modalities as well as genetic, clinical and cognitive information.

507,504,"Amyloid plaques are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The visualization of amyloid plaques in the brain is important to monitor AD progression and to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Our group has developed several contrast agents to detect amyloid plaques in vivo using magnetic resonance microimaging (mu MRI) in AD transgenic mice, where we used intra-carotid mannitol to enhance blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. In the present study, we used ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles, chemically coupled with A beta 1-42 peptide to detect amyloid deposition along with mannitol for in vivo mu MRI by femoral intravenous injection. A 3D gradient multi-echo sequence was used for imaging with a 100 mu m isotropic resolution. The amyloid plaques detected by T2*-weighted mu MRI were confirmed with matched histological sections. Furthermore, two different quantitative analyses were used. The region of interest-based quantitative measurement of T2* values showed contrast-injected APP/PS1 mice had significantly reduced T2* values compared to wild-type mice. In addition, the scans were examined with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for comparison of contrast-injected AD transgenic and wild-type mice. The regional differences seen in VBM comparing USPIO-A beta 1-42 injected APP/PS1 and wild-type mice correlated with the amyloid plaque distribution histologically, contrasting with no differences between the two groups of mice without contrast agent injection in regions of the brain with amyloid deposition. Our results demonstrated that both approaches were able to identify the differences between AD transgenic mice and wildtype mice, after injected with USPIO-A beta 1-42.

508,505,"In near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of human cerebral hemodynamics, detection of stimulus-related responses is confounded by the presence of unrelated trends in both the brain and the overlying scalp. A proposed strategy for reducing hemodynamic noise has been to record ""scalp only"" trends simultaneously via a second shorter-separation detector (similar to 5 mm rather than similar to 30 mm) and perform a subtraction (C-NIRS, for ""corrected near-infrared spectroscopy""). To compare the single- and dual-detector strategies, a 21-volunteer study of visual stimulation responses (6 stimulation blocks and 8 recording channels per measurement run) has been conducted. Activation-flagged channels were defined based upon (a) the significance (p-value) of the average rise in oxyhemoglobin concentration and (b) the average signal-to-noise over 6 stimulation epochs. At reasonable thresholds (p < 0.025, SNR > 1), the C-NIRS method increased the number of activation-flagged channels from 47 to 66, an increase of 40%, adding 24 channels and eliminating only 5. Of the 71 channels that were activation-flagged by at least one modality, the C-NIRS time series exhibited more significant oxyhemoglobin rise in 80% of such channels, and better signal-to-noise in 73%. In addition, single-subject C-NIRS stimulus responses were more consistent than NIRS over the six stimulation epochs, with significantly lower coefficients of variation in both amplitude and latency (i.e. time between stimulus onset and maximum hemoglobin rise). These results demonstrate that two-detector C-NIRS provides a straightforward way of (a) removing hemodynamic interference from NIRS data, (b) increasing the detection rate of cerebrally-unique responses, and (c) improving the quality of those recorded responses. Parallel insights regarding deoxyhemoglobin trends could not be drawn from this data set but should be attainable in future studies with higher signal to noise ratios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

510,507,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable people with paralysis to communicate with their environment. Motor imagery can be used to generate distinct patterns of cortical activation in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and thus control a BCI. To elucidate the cortical correlates of BCI control, users of a sensory motor rhythm (SMR)-BCI were classified according to their BCI control performance. In a second session these participants performed a motor imagery, motor observation and motor execution task in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. Group difference analysis between high and low aptitude BCI users revealed significantly higher activation of the supplementary motor areas (SMA) for the motor imagery and the motor observation tasks in high aptitude users. Low aptitude users showed no activation when observing movement. The number of activated voxels during motor observation was significantly correlated with accuracy in the EEG-BCI task (r = 0.53). Furthermore, the number of activated voxels in the right middle frontal gyrus, an area responsible for processing of movement observation, correlated (r = 0.72) with BCI-performance. This strong correlation highlights the importance of these areas for task monitoring and working memory as task goals have to be activated throughout the BCI session. The ability to regulate behavior and the brain through learning mechanisms involving imagery such as required to control a BCI constitutes the consequence of ideo-motor co-activation of motor brain systems during observation of movements.

510,507,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable people with paralysis to communicate with their environment. Motor imagery can be used to generate distinct patterns of cortical activation in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and thus control a BCI. To elucidate the cortical correlates of BCI control, users of a sensory motor rhythm (SMR)-BCI were classified according to their BCI control performance. In a second session these participants performed a motor imagery, motor observation and motor execution task in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. Group difference analysis between high and low aptitude BCI users revealed significantly higher activation of the supplementary motor areas (SMA) for the motor imagery and the motor observation tasks in high aptitude users. Low aptitude users showed no activation when observing movement. The number of activated voxels during motor observation was significantly correlated with accuracy in the EEG-BCI task (r = 0.53). Furthermore, the number of activated voxels in the right middle frontal gyrus, an area responsible for processing of movement observation, correlated (r = 0.72) with BCI-performance.

511,508,"Mental simulations are often focused on a goal in the future or a problem to be solved. Recent neuroimaging studies have associated mental simulations of the future with default network activity, but the simulations in these studies were not typically directed toward achieving a particular goal. Goal-directed simulation requires cognitive control to maintain information, make decisions, and coordinate abstract action sequences. Therefore, it should recruit not only the default network, but also executive regions. To investigate whether default network and executive regions can be coactive in the context of goal-directed simulation, we designed a problem-solving task in which participants simulated solving several specific problems in imaginary scenarios while in the MRI scanner. We analyzed brain activity during simulation relative to a semantic elaboration task and found that goal-directed simulation engaged core regions of the default network and executive dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. A functional connectivity analysis with posterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seeds revealed that activity in these regions was coupled throughout the goal-directed simulation period and associated with a distributed network of other default and executive regions, including medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal, and parietal regions.

Although in vivo neuroimaging captures spatial and temporal patterns of age-related changes of anatomy at the macroscopic scale, our knowledge of the underlying (patho)physiological processes at cellular and molecular levels is still limited. The aim of this study is to explore brain tissue properties in normal ageing using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alongside conventional morphological assessment. Using a whole-brain approach in a cohort of 26 adults, aged 18-85 years, we performed voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis and voxel-based quantification (VBQ) of diffusion tensor, magnetization transfer (MT), R1, and R2* relaxation parameters. We found age-related reductions in cortical and subcortical grey matter volume paralleled by changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), MT and R2*. The latter were regionally specific depending on their differential sensitivity to microscopic tissue properties. VBQ of white matter revealed distinct anatomical patterns of age-related change in microstructure. Widespread and profound reduction in MT contrasted with local FA decreases paralleled by MD increases. R1 reductions and R2* increases were observed to a smaller extent in overlapping occipito-parietal white matter regions. We interpret our findings, based on current biophysical models, as a fingerprint of age-dependent brain atrophy and underlying microstructural changes in myelin, iron deposits and water. The VBQ approach we present allows for systematic unbiased exploration of the interaction between imaging parameters and extends current methods for detection of neurodegenerative processes in the brain.

The clinical effectiveness of subthalamic nucleus (STN) high frequency stimulation indicates a crucial role of this nucleus within the affected motor networks in PD. Here we investigate alterations in the functional connectivity (FC) profile of the STN using resting state BOLD correlations on a voxel-by-voxel basis in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We compared early stage PD patients (n = 31) during the medication-off state with healthy controls (n = 44). The analysis revealed increased FC between the STN and cortical motor areas (BA 4 and 6) in PD patients in accordance with electrophysiological studies. Moreover. FC analysis of the primary motor cortex (M1) hand area revealed that the FC increase was primarily found in the STN area within the basal ganglia. These findings are in good agreement with recent experimental data, suggesting that an increased STN-motor cortex synchronicity mediated via the so called hyperdirect motor cortex-subthalamic pathway might play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of PD. An additional subgroup analysis was performed according to the presence (n = 16) or absence (n = 15) of tremor in patients. Compared to healthy controls tremor patients showed increased STN FC specifically in the hand area of M1 and the primary sensory cortex. In non-tremor patients, increased FC values were also found between the STN and midline cortical motor areas including the SMA.

514,511,"We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative to manual segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis that a large fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject, and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method. The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl et al., 2002); hippocampus segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion (Artaechevarria et al., 2009): brain extraction using BET (Smith, 2002): and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al., 2001). The wrapper method generates 72%, 14%, 29% and 21% fewer erroneously segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion as the host method, the average Dice overlap between reference segmentations and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction, white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

515,512,"Characterizing demyelination/degeneration of spinal pathways in traumatic spinal cord injured (SCI) patients is crucial for assessing the prognosis of functional rehabilitation. Novel techniques based on diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging provide sensitive and specific markers of white matter pathology. In this paper we combined for the first time high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI), MT imaging and atrophy measurements to evaluate the cervical spinal cord of fourteen SCI patients and age-matched controls. We used high in-plane resolution to delineate dorsal and ventrolateral pathways. Significant differences were detected between patients and controls in the normal-appearing white matter for fractional anisotropy (FA, p < 0.0001), axial diffusivity (p < 0.05), radial diffusivity (p < 0.05), generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA, p < 0.0001), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR, p < 0.0001) and cord area (p < 0.05). No significant difference was detected in mean diffusivity (p = 0.41), T1-weighted (p = 0.76) and 12-weighted (p = 0.09) signals. MRI metrics were remarkably well correlated with clinical disability (Pearson's correlations, FA: p < 0.01, GFA: p < 0.01, radial diffusivity: p = 0.01, MTR: p = 0.04 and atrophy: p < 0.01). Stepwise linear regressions showed that measures of MTR in the dorsal spinal cord predicted the sensory disability whereas measures of MTR in the ventrolateral spinal cord predicted the motor disability (ASIA score). However, diffusion metrics were not specific to the sensorimotor scores. Due to the specificity of axial and radial diffusivity and MT measurements, results suggest the detection of demyelination and degeneration in SCI patients.

516,513,"Complex network analyses of functional connectivity have consistently revealed non-random (modular, small-world, scale-free-like) behavior of hard-thresholded networks constructed from the right-tail of the similarity histogram. In the present study we determined network properties resulting from edges constrained to specific ranges across the full correlation histogram, in particular the left (negative-most) tail, and their dependence on the confound signal removal strategy employed. In the absence of global signal correction, left-tail networks comprised predominantly long range connections associated with weak correlations and were characterized by substantially reduced modularity and clustering, negative assortativity and gamma<1 Deconvolution of specific confound signals (white matter, CSF and motion) resulted in the most robust within-subject reproducibility of global network parameters (ICCs similar to 0.5). Global signal removal altered the network topology in the left tail, with the clustering coefficient and assortativity converging to zero. Networks constructed from the absolute value of the correlation coefficient were thus compromised following global signal removal since the different right-tail and left-tail topologies were mixed. These findings informed the construction of soft-thresholded networks, replacing the hard thresholding or binarization operation with a continuous mapping of all correlation values to edge weights, suppressing rather than removing weaker connections and avoiding issues related to network fragmentation. A power law adjacency function with beta = 12 yielded modular networks whose parameters agreed well with corresponding hard-thresholded values, that were reproducible in repeated sessions across many months and evidenced small-world-like and scale-free-like properties.

517,514,"Functional neuroimaging studies frequently demonstrated that stroke patients show bilateral activity in motor and premotor areas during movements of the paretic hand in contrast to a more lateralized activation observed in healthy subjects. Moreover, a few studies modeling functional or effective connectivity reported performance-related changes in the motor network after stroke. Here, we investigated the temporal evolution of intra- and interhemispheric (dys-) connectivity during motor recovery from the acute to the early chronic phase post-stroke. Twelve patients performed hand movements in an fMRI task in the acute (<= 72 hours) and subacute stage (2 weeks) post-stroke. A subgroup of 10 patients participated in a third assessment in the early chronic stage (3-6 months). Twelve healthy subjects served as reference for brain connectivity. Changes in effective connectivity within a bilateral network comprising M1, premotor cortex (PMC), and supplementary motor area (SMA) were estimated by dynamic causal modeling. Motor performance was assessed by the Action Research Arm Test and maximum grip force. Results showed reduced positive coupling of ipsilesional SMA and PMC with ipsilesional M1 in the acute stage. Coupling parameters among these areas increased with recovery and predicted a better outcome. Likewise, negative influences from ipsilesional areas to contralesional M1 were attenuated in the acute stage. In the subacute stage, contralesional M1 exerted a positive influence on ipsilesional M1. Negative influences from ipsilesional areas on contralesional M1 subsequently normalized, but patients with poorer outcome in the chronic stage now showed enhanced negative coupling from contralesional upon ipsilesional M1. These findings show that the reinstatement of effective connectivity in the ipsilesional hemisphere is an important feature of motor recovery after stroke. The shift of an early, supportive role of contralesional M1 into enhanced inhibitory coupling might indicate maladaptive processes which could be a target of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.

519,516,"Although interactivity is considered a fundamental principle of cognitive (and computational) models of reading, it has received far less attention in neural models of reading that instead focus on serial stages of feed-forward processing from visual input to orthographic processing to accessing the corresponding phonological and semantic information. In particular, the left ventral occipito-temporal (vOT) cortex is proposed to be the first stage where visual word recognition occurs prior to accessing nonvisual information such as semantics and phonology. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether there is evidence that activation in vOT is influenced top-down by the interaction of visual and nonvisual properties of the stimuli during visual word recognition tasks. Participants performed two different types of lexical decision tasks that focused on either visual or nonvisual properties of the word or word-like stimuli. The design allowed us to investigate how vOT activation during visual word recognition was influenced by a task change to the same stimuli and by a stimulus change during the same task. We found both stimulus- and task-driven modulation of vOT activation that can only be explained by top-down processing of nonvisual aspects of the task and stimuli. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that vOT acts as an interface linking visual form with nonvisual processing in both bottom up and top down directions. Such interactive processing at the neural level is in agreement with cognitive and computational models of reading but challenges some of the assumptions made by current neuro-anatomical models of reading.

Twenty subjects performed a speeded instructed choice task (a variant of the Simon task) designed to elicit response errors, and also underwent DTI scanning in a separate session.

After tDCS, EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting state followed by a working memory (n-back) task. Statistical non-parametric mapping showed reduced left frontal delta activity in the real tDCS condition. Specifically, a significant reduction of mean current densities (sLORETA) for the delta band was detected in the left subgenual PFC, the anterior cingulate and in the left medial frontal gyrus. Moreover, the effect was strongest for the first 5 min (p<0.01). The following n-back task revealed a positive impact of prefrontal tDCS on error rate, accuracy and reaction time.

In this work, we use pulsed arterial-spin labelling to quantify regional CBF in 86 cognitively and physically healthy adults, aged 23 to 88 years. Surface-based analyses were utilized to map regional decline in CBF and cortical thickness with advancing age, and to examine the spatial associations and dissociations between these metrics.

524,521,"Working memory (WM) is an essential component for human higher order cognitive activities. Creativity has been essential to the development of human civilization. Previous studies from different fields have suggested creativity and capacity of WM have opposing characteristics possibly in terms of diffuse attention. However, despite a number of functional imaging studies on creativity, how creativity relates to brain activity during WM has never been investigated. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated this issue using an n-back WM paradigm and a psychometric measure of creativity (a divergent thinking test). A multiple regression analysis revealed that individual creativity was significantly and positively correlated with brain activity in the precuneus during the 2-back task (WM task), but not during the non-WM 0-back task. As the precuneus shows deactivation during cognitive tasks, our findings show that reduced task induced deactivation (TID) in the precuneus is associated with higher creativity measured by divergent thinking. The precuneus is included in the default mode network, which is deactivated during cognitive tasks. The magnitude of TID in the default mode network is considered to reflect the reallocation of cognitive resources from networks irrelevant to the performance of the task. Thus, our findings may indicate that individual creativity, as measured by the divergent thinking test, is related to the inefficient reallocation of attention, congruent with the idea that diffuse attention is associated with individual creativity.

We hypothesized that structural subcortico-cortical connections may provide integral routes for communication between cortical resting state networks, and that changes in the integrity of these connections have a role in cognitive aging. We combined anatomical MRI, diffusion tensor MRI, and resting state fMRI in 100 healthy elderly to identify fiber bundles connecting cortical resting state networks to subcortical nuclei. In identified tracts, white matter fiber bundle integrity measures were compared to composite cognitive measures on executive function, processing speed, and memory performance. The integrity (FA values) in selected fiber bundles correlated strongly with cognitive measures on executive function and processing speed. Correlation was most pronounced between executive function and fiber bundles connecting the putamen to the dorsal attention network ( r = 0.73, p < 0.001).

526,523,"Aversive events are typically more debilitating when they occur unpredictably than predictably. Studies in humans and animals indicate that predictable and unpredictable aversive events can induce phasic and sustained fear, respectively. Research in rodents suggests that anatomically related but distinct neural circuits may mediate phasic and sustained fear. We explored this issue in humans by examining threat predictability in three virtual reality contexts, one in which electric shocks were predictably signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks occurred unpredictably but never paired with a cue, and a third in which no shocks were delivered. Evidence of threat-induced phasic and sustained fear was presented using fear ratings and skin conductance. Utilizing recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we were able to conduct whole-brain fMRI at relatively high spatial resolution and still have enough sensitivity to detect transient and sustained signal changes in the basal forebrain. We found that both predictable and unpredictable threat evoked transient activity in the dorsal amygdala, but that only unpredictable threat produced sustained activity in a forebrain region corresponding to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex. Consistent with animal models hypothesizing a role for the cortex in generating sustained fear, sustained signal increases to unpredictable threat were also found in anterior insula and a frontoparietal cortical network associated with hypervigilance. In addition, unpredictable threat led to transient activity in the ventral amygdala hippocampal area and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, as well as transient activation and subsequent deactivation of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, limbic structures that have been implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress responses. In line with basic findings in rodents, these results provide evidence that phasic and sustained fear in humans may manifest similar signs of distress, but appear to be associated with different patterns of neural activity in the human basal forebrain.

Resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded (14 channels) from 227 children twice at 5 and 7 years of age.

Repeated measures analysis of variance tested for time and gender effects. For all frequency bands mean SL decreased from 5 to 7 years. Clustering coefficient increased in the alpha band. Path length increased in all frequency bands. Mean normalized weight dispersion decreased in beta band. Girls showed higher synchronization for all frequency bands and a higher mean clustering in alpha and beta bands. The overall decrease in functional connectivity (SL) might reflect pruning of unused synapses and preservation of strong connections resulting in more cost-effective networks.

528,525,"People vary in their ability to learn new motor skills. We hypothesize that between-subject variability in brain structure and function can explain differences in learning. We use brain functional and structural MRI methods to characterize such neural correlates of individual variations in motor learning. Healthy subjects applied isometric grip force of varying magnitudes with their right hands cued visually to generate smoothly-varying pressures following a regular pattern. We tested whether individual variations in motor learning were associated with anatomically colocalized variations in magnitude of functional MRI (fMRI) signal or in MRI differences related to white and grey matter microstructure. We found that individual motor learning was correlated with greater functional activation in the prefrontal, premotor, and parietal cortices, as well as in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Structural MRI correlates were found in the premotor cortex [for fractional anisotropy (FA)] and in the cerebellum [for both grey matter density and FA]. The cerebellar microstructural differences were anatomically colocalized with fMRI correlates of learning. This study thus suggests that variations across the population in the function and structure of specific brain regions for motor control explain some of the individual differences in skill learning. This strengthens the notion that brain structure determines some limits to cognitive function even in a healthy population.

529,526,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulty in performing self-initiated movements. The neural mechanism of this deficiency remains unclear. In the current study, we used functional MRI (fMRI) and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) methods to investigate the changes in effective connectivity of the brain networks during performance of self-initiated movement in PD patients. Effective connectivity is defined as the influence one neuronal system exerts over another. fMRIs were acquired in 18 PD patients and in 18 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, when performing a self-initiated right hand tapping task. We chose the left primary motor cortex (M1), rostral supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), left premotor cortex (PMC), left putamen, and right cerebellum as index areas for PPI analysis. During the performance of self-initiated movement, connectivity between the putamen and M1, PMC, SMA, and cerebellum was decreased in PD patients compared to controls. In contrast, connections between the M1, pre-SMA, PMC, parietal cortex, and cerebellum were increased in PD patients compared to controls. In addition, the M1, pre-SMA, PMC, and cerebellum also had less connectivity with the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex in PD. In PD patients, the effective connectivity between the putamen and M1, PMC, SMA, and cerebellum negatively correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores; whereas the connectivity between the M1, pre-SMA, PMC, and cerebellum positively correlated with the UPDRS motor scores. Our findings demonstrate that the pattern of interactions of brain networks is disrupted in PD during performance of self-initiated movements. The striatum-cortical and striatum-cerebellar connections are weakened. In contrast, the connections between cortico-cerebellar motor regions are strengthened and may compensate for basal ganglia dysfunction. These altered interregional connections are more deviant when the disorder is more severe, and, therefore, our results give further insight into the explanation for the difficulty in performing self-initiated movements in PD.

530,527,"Introduction: Numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have addressed the question of morphological differences of the brain of men and women, reporting conflicting results regarding brain size and the ratio of gray and white matter. In the present study, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to delineate sex differences of brain white matter. Methods: We investigated brain microstructure in 25 male and 25 female healthy subjects using a 3 T MRI scanner. Whole-head DTI scans were analyzed without a-priori hypothesis using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) calculating maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD, a potential marker of glial alteration and changes in myelination) and axial diffusivity (AD, a potential marker of axonal changes). Results: DTI revealed regional microstructural differences between the brains of male and female subjects. Those were prominent in the thalamus, corpus callosum and cingulum. Men showed significantly (p<0.0001) higher values of fractional anisotropy and lower radial diffusivity in these areas, suggesting that the observed differences are mainly due to differences in myelination. Discussion: As a novel finding we showed widespread differences in thalamic microstructure that have not been described previously. Additionally, the present study confirmed earlier DTI studies focusing on sexual dimorphism in the corpus callosum and cingulum. All changes appear to be based on differences in myelination. The sex differences in thalamic microstructure call for further studies on the underlying cause and the behavioral correlates of this sexual dimorphism.

531,528,"Very low birth weight preterm (FT) children are at high risk for brain injury. Employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we tested the hypothesis that PT adolescents would demonstrate microstructural white matter disorganization relative to term controls at 16 years of age. Forty-four PT subjects (600-1250 g birth weight) without neonatal brain injury and 41 term controls were evaluated at age 16 years with DTI, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC), the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test Revised (PPVT), and the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP). PT subjects scored lower than term subjects on WISC full scale (p = 0.003), verbal (p = 0.043), and performance IQ tests (p = 0.001), as well as CTOPP phonological awareness (p = 0.004), but scored comparably to term subjects on PPVT and CTOPP Rapid Naming tests. PT subjects had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in multiple regions including bilateral uncinate fasciculi (left: p = 0.01; right: p = 0.004), bilateral external capsules (left: p<0.001; right: p<0.001), the splenium of the corpus callosum (p = 0.008), and white matter serving the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally (left: p<0.001; right: p = 0.011). FA values in both the left and right uncinate fasciculi correlated with PPVT scores (a semantic language task) in the PT subjects (left: r = 0.314, p = 0.038; right: r = 0.336, p = 0.026). FA values in the left and right arcuate fasciculi correlated with CTOPP Rapid Naming scores (a phonologic task) in the PT subjects (left: r = 0.424, p = 0.004; right: r = 0.301, p = 0.047). These data support for the first time that dual pathways underlying language function are present in PT adolescents. The striking bilateral dorsal correlations for the PT group suggest that prematurely born subjects rely more heavily on the right hemisphere than typically developing adults for performance of phonological language tasks. These findings may represent either a delay in maturation or the engagement of alternative neural pathways for language in the developing PT brain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

532,529,"Previous neuromorphometric investigations of major depressive disorder (MDD) have reported abnormalities in gray matter in several regions, although the results have been inconsistent across studies. Some discrepancies in the results across studies may reflect design limitations such as small sample sizes, whereas others may reflect biological variability that potentially manifests as differences in clinical course. For example, it remains unclear whether the abnormalities found in persistently depressed MDD subjects extend to or persist in patients who experience prolonged remission. The aim of the present study was to investigate gray matter (GM) differences in unmedicated, currently-depressed participants (dMDD) and unmedicated, currently-remitted (rMDD) participants with MDD compared to healthy controls (HC). The GM density and volume were compared across groups using voxel-based morphometry, a quantitative neuroanatomical technique, and high-resolution MRI images from 107 HC, 58 dMDD and 27 rMDD subjects. Relative to the HC group the dMDD group had reduced GM in the dorsal anterolateral (DALPFC), the dorsomedial (DMPFC) and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Relative to the rMDD group the dMDD group showed reduced GM in the DALPFC, the VLPFC, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the precuneus and the inferior parietal lobule. No regions were identified in which the rMDD group showed significantly lower GM compared to the HC group after p-values were corrected for the number of comparisons performed. In unmedicated patients in the depressed phase of MOD, we found evidence of morphometric abnormalities in DALPFC and in medial prefrontal cortical regions belonging to the visceromotor network. These findings, along with the absence of GM abnormalities in the remitted sample imply a possible link between greater GM tissue and better clinical outcome. Consistent with other neuroimaging and post-mortem neuropathological studies of MDD, we also found evidence of decreased white matter in patients with dMDD and rMDD.

In addition, we observed that an exponentially truncated power law fits the topological distribution for the degree of total incoming and outgoing connectivity.

534,531,"The brain's energy economy excessively favors intrinsic, spontaneous neural activity over extrinsic, evoked activity, presumably to maintain its internal organization. Emerging hypotheses capable of explaining such an investment posit that the brain's intrinsic functional architecture encodes a blueprint for its repertoire of responses to the external world. Yet, there is little evidence directly linking intrinsic and extrinsic activity in the brain. Here we relate differences among individuals in the magnitude of task-evoked activity during performance of an Eriksen flanker task, to spontaneous oscillatory phenomena observed during rest Specifically, we focused on the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations (LFO, 0.01-0.1 Hz) present in the BOLD signal. LFO amplitude measures obtained during rest successfully predicted the magnitude of task-evoked activity in a variety of regions that were all activated during performance of the flanker task In these regions, higher LFO amplitude at rest predicted higher task-evoked activity. LFO amplitude measures obtained during rest were also found to have robust predictive value for behavior. In midline cingulate regions, LFO amplitudes predicted not only the speed and consistency of performance but also the magnitude of the behavioral congruency effect embedded in the flanker task. These results support the emerging hypothesis that the brain's repertoire of responses to the external world are represented and updated in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture.

535,532,"Coherent behavior depends on attentional control that detects and resolves conflict between opposing actions. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging study tested the hypothesis that emotion triggers attentional control to speed up conflict processing in particularly salient situations. Therefore, we presented emotionally negative and neutral words in a version of the flanker task. In response to conflict, we found activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and of the amygdala for emotional stimuli. When emotion and conflict coincided, a region in the ventral ACC was activated, which resulted in faster conflict processing in reaction times. Emotion also increased functional connectivity between the ventral ACC and activation of the dorsal ACC and the amygdala in conflict trials. These data suggest that the ventral ACC integrates emotion and conflict and prioritizes the processing of conflict in emotional trials. This adaptive mechanism ensures rapid detection and resolution of conflict in potentially threatening situations signaled by emotional stimuli. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 198-208, 2011.

In this study, we asked what systems are activated for early-stage romantic love in Easterners, specifically Chinese participants? Are these activations affected by individual differences within a cultural context of Traditionality and Modernity? Also, are these brain activations correlated with later satisfaction in the relationship? In Beijing, we used the same procedure used by Aron et al. (Aron et al. [2005]: J Neurophysiol 94: 327-337). The stimuli for 18 Chinese participants were a picture of the face of their beloved, the face of a familiar acquaintance, and a countback task. We found significant activations specific to the beloved in the reward and motivation systems, particularly, the ventral tegmental area and the caudate. The mid-orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum were also activated, whereas amygdala, medial orbitofrontal, and medial accumbens activity were decreased relative to the familiar acquaintance. Self-reported Traditionality and Modernity scores were each positively correlated with activity in the nucleus accumbens, although in different regions and sides of the brain. Activity in the subgenual area and the superior frontal gyrus was associated with higher relationship happiness at 18-month follow-up. Our results show that midbrain dopamine-rich reward/motivation systems were activated by early-stage romantic love in Chinese participants, as found by other studies.

This study, using a multimodal imaging approach, aims to assess in vivo the functional and structural integrity of regions and regional networks linked with motor, cognitive and psychiatric function.

Findings were correlated with disease-burden and UHDRS scores. Atrophy was detected in sensorimotor striatum (SMST), substantia nigra, orbitofrontal and anterior prefrontal cortex in the premanifest HD. D2/D3 receptor binding was reduced and microglial activation increased in SMST and associative striatum (AST), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the amygdala and the hypothalamus. In symptomatic HD cases this extended to involve atrophy in globus pallidus, limbic striatum, the red nuclei, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula.

In premanifest HD, increased levels of microglial activation in the AST and in the regional network associated with cognitive function correlated with p5 HD onset.

538,535,"Preterm birth with very low birth weight (VLBW, <= 1500 g) is connected to reduced white matter (WM) integrity in childhood and adolescence. These changes in WM are correlated to motor, sensory and neuropsychological impairments. CNS myelination continues into the early twenties, but the consequences of this for WM integrity in VLBWs have not been explored. DTI and tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) was carried out to test for voxelwise differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), eigenvalues and mean diffusivity (MD) between a preterm VLBW group (n =49) and a control group born at term (n = 59) at 18-22 years of age. TBSS was also used to explore the relationship between perinatal clinical data and general cognitive ability (total IQ), respectively, and the DTI metrics (FA and MD), with gender and age as a confounder. In the VLBW group several major WM tracts particularly in the posterior region had significantly reduced FA caused by an increase in the two lowest eigenvalues. MD was significantly increased in the VLBWs in 50% of the same regions as the FA changes, but encompassing also more peripheral WM. In the VLBW group, FA was found to correlate positively with birth weight and negatively with number of days in intensive care and on mechanical ventilator, particularly in the corpus callosum. FA was found to correlate positively with total IQ in the young preterm adults. In the controls there was no correlation between FA and total IQ. Our results indicate that the neurologic sequelae of preterm birth with VLBW are a lifelong condition inducing structural and functional impairments also in adulthood in VLBW survivors. The greatest risk of having reduced WM integrity in adulthood was found in the most immature VLBW neonates requiring mechanical ventilation and long-term intensive care. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

540,537,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often a prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is frequently considered to be a good target for early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions of AD. Recent emergence of reliable network characterization techniques has made it possible to understand neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level. Accordingly, we propose an effective network-based multivariate classification algorithm, using a collection of measures derived from white matter (WM) connectivity networks, to accurately identify MCI patients from normal controls. An enriched description of WM connections, utilizing six physiological parameters, i.e., fiber count, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and principal diffusivities(lambda(1), lambda(2), and lambda(3)). results in six connectivity networks for each subject to account for the connection topology and the biophysical properties of the connections. Upon parcellating the brain into 90 regions-of-interest (ROIs), these properties can be quantified for each pair of regions with common traversing fibers. For building an MCI classifier, clustering coefficient of each ROI in relation to the remaining ROIs is extracted as feature for classification. These features are then ranked according to their Pearson correlation with respect to the clinical labels, and are further sieved to select the most discriminant subset of features using an SVM-based feature selection algorithm. Finally, support vector machines (SVMs) are trained using the selected subset of features. Classification accuracy was evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation to ensure generalization of performance. The classification accuracy given by our enriched description of WM connections is 88.9%, which is an increase of at least 14.8% from that using simple WM connectivity description with any single physiological parameter. A cross-validation estimation of the generalization performance shows an area of 0.929 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating excellent diagnostic power. It was also found, based on the selected features, that portions of the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, parietal lobe and insula regions provided the most discriminant features for classification, in line with results reported in previous studies. Our MCI classification framework, especially the enriched description of WM connections, allows accurate early detection of brain abnormalities, which is of paramount importance for treatment management of potential AD patients.

541,538,"Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that human brain networks have economic small-world topology and modular organization, enabling efficient information transfer among brain regions. However, it remains largely unknown how the small-world topology and modular organization of human brain networks emerge and develop. Using longitudinal MRI data of 28 healthy pediatric subjects, collected at their ages of 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years, we analyzed development patterns of brain anatomical networks derived from morphological correlations of brain regional volumes. The results show that the brain network of 1-month-olds has the characteristically economic small-world topology and nonrandom modular organization. The network's cost efficiency increases with the brain development to 1 year and 2 years, so does the modularity, providing supportive evidence for the hypothesis that the small-world topology and the modular organization of brain networks are established during early brain development to support rapid synchronization and information transfer with minimal rewiring cost, as well as to balance between local processing and global integration of information.

Here, we demonstrate that the hydroxyl protons on MI exhibit chemical exchange with bulk water and saturation of these protons leads to reduction in bulk water signal through a mechanism known as chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST). The hydroxyl proton exchange rate (k = 600 s(-1)) is determined to be in the slow to intermediate exchange regime on the NMR time scale (chemical shift (Delta omega)>k), suggesting that the CEST effect of MI (MICEST) can be imaged at high fields such as 71 (Delta omega =1.2 x 10(3) rad/s) and 9.41 (Delta omega = 1.6 x 10(3) rad/s). Using optimized imaging parameters, concentration dependent broad CEST asymmetry between similar to 0.2 and 1.5 ppm with a peak at similar to 0.6 ppm from bulk water was observed. Further, it is demonstrated that MICEST detection is feasible in the human brain at ultra high fields (7 T) without exceeding the allowed limits on radiofrequency specific absorption rate. Results from healthy human volunteers (N = 5) showed significantly higher (p = 0.03) MICEST effect from white matter (5.2 +/- 0.5%) compared to gray matter (4.3 +/- 0.5%). The mean coefficient of variations for intra-subject MICEST contrast in WM and GM were 0.49 and 0.58 respectively. Potential overlap of CEST signals from other brain metabolites with the observed MICEST map is discussed. This noninvasive approach potentially opens the way to image MI in vivo and to monitor its alteration in many disease conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

543,540,"In recent years, neuroimaging studies have increasingly been acquiring multiple modalities of data and searching for task-or disease-related changes in each modality separately. A major challenge in analysis is to find systematic approaches for fusing these differing data types together to automatically find patterns of related changes across multiple modalities, when they exist. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular unsupervised learning method that can be used to find the modes of variation in neuroimaging data across a group of subjects. When multimodal data is acquired for the subjects, ICA is typically performed separately on each modality, leading to incompatible decompositions across modalities. Using a modular Bayesian framework, we develop a novel ""Linked ICA"" model for simultaneously modelling and discovering common features across multiple modalities, which can potentially have completely different units, signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, voxel counts, spatial smoothnesses and intensity distributions. Furthermore, this general model can be configured to allow tensor ICA or spatially-concatenated ICA decompositions, or a combination of both at the same time. Linked ICA automatically determines the optimal weighting of each modality, and also can detect single-modality structured components when present. This is a fully probabilistic approach, implemented using Variational Bayes. We evaluate the method on simulated multimodal data sets, as well as on a real data set of Alzheimer's patients and age-matched controls that combines two very different types of structural MRI data: morphological data (grey matter density) and diffusion data (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and tensor mode).

544,541,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that alters cortical excitability and activity in a polarity-dependent way. Stimulation for a few minutes has been shown to induce plastic alterations of cortical excitability and to improve cognitive performance. These effects might be related to stimulation-induced alterations of functional cortical network connectivity. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortical network function by functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis of the BOLD fMRI spontaneous activity. fMRI resting-state datasets were acquired immediately before and after 10-min bipolar tDCS during rest, with the anode placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathode over the contralateral frontopolar cortex. For each dataset, grey matter voxel-based synchronization matrices were calculated and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. Nodal connectivity degree and minimum path length maps were calculated and compared before and after tDCS. Nodal minimum path lengths significantly increased in the left somatomotor (SM1) cortex after anodal tDCS, which means that the number of direct functional connections from the left SM1 to topologically distant grey matter voxels significantly decreased. In contrast, functional coupling between premotor and superior parietal areas with the left SM1 significantly increased. Additionally, the nodal connectivity degree in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) area as well as in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right DLPFC) significantly increased. In summary, we provide initial support that tDCS-induced neuroplastic alterations might be related to functional connectivity changes in the human brain.

545,542,"Developmental dyslexia is a severe reading disorder, which is characterized by dysfluent reading and impaired automaticity of visual word processing. Adults with dyslexia show functional deficits in several brain regions including the so-called ""Visual Word Form Area"" (VWFA), which is implicated in visual word processing and located within the larger left occipitotemporal VWF-System. The present study examines functional connections of the left occipitotemporal VWF-System with other major language areas in children with dyslexia. Functional connectivity MRI was used to assess connectivity of the VWF-System in 18 children with dyslexia and 24 age-matched controls (age 9.7-12.5 years) using five neighboring left occipitotemporal regions of interest (ROIs) during a continuous reading task requiring phonological and orthographic processing. First, the results revealed a focal origin of connectivity from the VWF-System, in that mainly the VWFA was functionally connected with typical left frontal and parietal language areas in control children. Adjacent posterior and anterior VWF-System ROIs did not show such connectivity, confirming the special role that the VWFA plays in word processing. Second, we detected a significant disruption of functional connectivity between the VWFA and left inferior frontal and left inferior parietal language areas in the children with dyslexia. The current findings add to our understanding of dyslexia by showing that functional disconnection of the left occipitotemporal system is limited to the small VWFA region crucial for automatic visual word processing, and emerges early during reading acquisition in children with dyslexia, along with deficits in orthographic and phonological processing of visual word forms.

546,543,"Alterations of connectivity are central to the systems-level pathophysiology of schizophrenia. One of the best-established genome-wide significant risk variants for this highly heritable disorder, the rs1344706 single nucleotide polymorphism in ZNF804A, was recently shown to modulate connectivity in healthy carriers during working memory (WM) in a pattern mirroring that which was found in overt disease. However, it was unclear whether this finding is specific to WM or if it is present regardless of cognitive state. Therefore, we examined genotype effects on connectivity in healthy carriers during rest and an emotion processing task without WM component. 111 healthy German subjects performed a battery of functional imaging tasks. Functional connectivity with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during rest and an implicit emotion recognition task was determined using the seed voxel method and compared to results during WM. During rest and during the emotional task, a pattern of reduced interhemispheric prefrontal connectivity with increasing number of rs1344706 risk alleles could be seen that was close to identical to that during WM, suggesting a state-independent influence of the genetic variant on interhemispheric processing, possibly through structural effects. By contrast, the abnormal prefronto-hippocampal connectivity was only seen during the WM task, indicating a degree of task specificity in agreement with prior results in patients with schizophrenia. Our findings confirm a key role for disturbed functional connectivity in the genetic risk architecture of schizophrenia and identify cognitive state-dependent and independent components with regard to WM function.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate a sample of Anorexia Nervosa restrictive type (AN-r) adolescent patients in the early stages of the illness, using VBM in order to characterize morphometric gray matter (GM) changes. Participants were 16 AN-r female patients (with no other psychiatric disorders) whose AN-r had been in progress for less than 12 months and 16 age-matched healthy female subjects. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were preprocessed according to the optimized VBM method, and statistically analyzed. The analyses revealed a significant global GM decrease in the AN-r patients; furthermore, a significant region-specific decrease in GM volume was found bilaterally in the middle cingulate cortex, the precuneus, and the inferior and superior parietal lobules. The significant early GM decrease in the aforementioned regions in AN-r adolescent patients suggests that there might be a region-specific GM vulnerability that could play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Given that these regions are also involved in the manipulation of mental images and the mental representation of the self, this might explain the presence of a distorted body image in these patients.

This functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study sought to determine if the poor performance of MJ Users was related to differences in brain activity while evaluating wins and losses during the strategy development phase of the IGT. MJ Users (16) and Controls (16) performed a modified IGT in an MRI scanner. Performance was tracked and functional activity in response to early wins and losses was examined. While the MJ Users continued to perform poorly at the end of the task, there was no difference in group performance during the initial strategy development phase. During this phase, before the emergence of behavioral differences, Controls exhibited significantly greater activity in response to losses in the anterior cingulate cortex, medial frontal cortex, precuneus, superior parietal lobe, occipital lobe and cerebellum as compared to MJ Users. Furthermore, in Controls, but not MJ Users, the functional response to losses in the anterior cingulate cortex, ventral medial prefrontal cortex and rostral prefrontal cortex positively correlated with performance over time. These data suggest Mj Users are less sensitive to negative feedback during strategy development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We evaluated brain morphological changes in patients with OSA and their relationship to neuropsychological and oximetric data. Sixteen patients affected by moderate-severe OSA (age: 55.8 +/- 6.7 years, 13 males) and fourteen control subjects (age: 57.6 +/- 5.1 years, 9 males) underwent 3.0 Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing evaluating short- and long-term memory, executive functions, language, attention, praxia and non-verbal learning. Volumetric segmentation of cortical and subcortical structures and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were performed. Patients and controls differed significantly in Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning test (immediate and delayed recall), Stroop test and Digit span backward scores. Volumes of cortical gray matter (GM), right hippocampus, right and left caudate were smaller in patients compared to controls, with also brain parenchymal fraction (a normalized measure of cerebral atrophy) approaching statistical significance. Differences remained significant after controlling for comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hypercholesterolemia). VBM analysis showed regions of decreased GM volume in right and left hippocampus and within more lateral temporal areas in patients with OSA. Our findings indicate that the significant cognitive impairment seen in patients with moderate-severe OSA is associated with brain tissue damage in regions involved in several cognitive tasks. We conclude that OSA can increase brain susceptibility to the effects of aging and other clinical and pathological occurrences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A new realization of this principle is presented. The method utilizes data acquired with high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), a measurement method that fulfills clinical requirements. For the first time among global reconstruction methods, the computation time is acceptable for a broad class of practical applications. The method does not involve any boundary conditions that prescribe the location of the ends of reconstructed fibers. This helps to minimize necessary user interaction and operator dependence. Results obtained in a physical phantom demonstrate a high reconstruction quality. In vivo results have been obtained in several volunteers.

553,550,"Background: Most neuroimaging studies of resting state networks have concentrated on functional connectivity (FC) based on instantaneous correlation in a single network. In this study we investigated both FC and effective connectivity (EC) based on Granger causality of four important networks at resting state derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging data - default mode network (DMN), hippocampal cortical memory network (HCMN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and fronto-parietal control network (FPCN). Methodology/principle findings: A method called correlation-purged Granger causality analysis was used, not only enabling the simultaneous evaluation of FC and EC of all networks using a single multivariate model, but also accounting for the interaction between them resulting from the smoothing of neuronal activity by hemodynamics. FC was visualized using a force-directed layout upon which causal interactions were overlaid. FC results revealed that DAN is very tightly coupled compared to the other networks while the DMN forms the backbone around which the other networks amalgamate. The pattern of bidirectional causal interactions indicates that posterior cingulate and posterior inferior parietal lobule of DMN act as major hubs. The pattern of unidirectional causal paths revealed that hippocampus and anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) receive major inputs, likely reflecting memory encoding/retrieval and cognitive integration, respectively. Major outputs emanating from anterior insula and middle temporal area, which are directed at aPFC, may carry information about interoceptive awareness and external environment, respectively, into aPFC for integration, supporting the hypothesis that aPFC-seeded FPCN acts as a control network. Conclusions/significance: Our findings indicate the following. First, regions whose activities are not synchronized interact via time-delayed causal influences. Second, the causal interactions are organized such that cingulo-parietal regions act as hubs. Finally, segregation of different resting state networks is not clear cut but only by soft boundaries.

554,551,"Signal transmission between different brain regions requires connecting fiber tracts, the structural basis of the human connectome. In contrast to animal brains, where a multitude of tract tracing methods can be used, magnetic resonance (MR)-based diffusion imaging is presently the only promising approach to study fiber tracts between specific human brain regions. However, this procedure has various inherent restrictions caused by its relatively low spatial resolution. Here, we introduce 3D-polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) to map the three-dimensional course of fiber tracts in the human brain with a resolution at a submillimeter scale based on a voxel size of 100 pm isotropic or less. 3D-PLI demonstrates nerve fibers by utilizing their intrinsic birefringence of myelin sheaths surrounding axons. This optical method enables the demonstration of 3D fiber orientations in serial microtome sections of entire human brains. Examples for the feasibility of this novel approach are given here. 3D-PLI enables the study of brain regions of intense fiber crossing in unprecedented detail, and provides an independent evaluation of fiber tracts derived from diffusion imaging data.

555,552,"Most studies involving spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD signal extract connectivity patterns that show relationships between brain areas that are maintained over the length of the scanning session. In this study, however, we examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the BOLD fluctuations to identify common patterns of propagation within a scan. A novel pattern finding algorithm was developed for detecting repeated spatiotemporal patterns in BOLD fMRI data. The algorithm was applied to high temporal resolution T2*-weighted multislice images obtained from rats and humans in the absence of any task or stimulation. In rats, the primary pattern consisted of waves of high signal intensity, propagating in a lateral to medial direction across the cortex, replicating our previous findings (Majeed et al., 2009a). These waves were observed primarily in sensorimotor cortex, but also extended to visual and parietal association areas. A secondary pattern, confined to subcortical regions consisted of an initial increase and subsequent decrease in signal intensity in the caudate-putamen. In humans, the most common spatiotemporal pattern consisted of an alteration between activation of areas comprising the ""default-mode"" (e.g., posterior cingulate and anterior medial prefrontal cortices) and the ""task-positive"" (e.g., superior parietal and premotor cortices) networks. Signal propagation from focal starting points was also observed. The pattern finding algorithm was shown to be reasonably insensitive to the variation in user-defined parameters, and the results were consistent within and between subjects. This novel approach for probing the spontaneous network activity of the brain has implications for the interpretation of conventional functional connectivity studies, and may increase the amount of information that can be obtained from neuroimaging data.

556,553,"We have used multivariate data analysis, more specifically orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS) analysis, to discriminate between Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly control subjects combining both regional and global magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric measures. In this study, 117 AD patients, 122 MCI patients and 112 control subjects (from the AddNeuroMed study) were included. High-resolution sagittal 3D MP-RAGE datasets were acquired from each subject. Automated regional segmentation and manual outlining of the hippocampus were performed for each image. Altogether this yielded volumes of 24 different anatomically defined structures which were used for OPLS analysis. 17 randomly selected AD patients, 12 randomly selected control subjects and the 22 MCI subjects who converted to AD at 1-year follow up were excluded from the initial OPLS analysis to provide a small external test set for model validation. Comparing AD with controls we found a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 90% using hippocampal measures alone. Combining both global and regional measures resulted in a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 94%. This increase in sensitivity and specificity resulted in an increase of the positive likelihood ratio from 9 to 15. From the external test set, the model predicted 82% of the AD patients and 83% of the control subjects correctly. Finally, 73% of the MCI subjects which converted to AD at 1 year follow-up were shown to resemble AD patients more closely than controls. This method shows potential for distinguishing between different patient groups. Combining the different MRI measures together resulted in a significantly better classification than using them separately. OPLS also shows potential for predicting conversion from MCI to AD.

557,554,"The circuit changes that mediate parkinsonian tremor, while likely differing from those underlying akinesia and rigidity, are not precisely known. In this study, to identify a specific metabolic brain network associated with this disease manifestation, we used FDG PET to scan nine tremor dominant Parkinson's disease (PD) patients at baseline and during ventral intermediate (Vim) thalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS). Ordinal trends canonical variates analysis (OrT/CVA) was performed on the within-subject scan data to detect a significant spatial covariance pattern with consistent changes in subject expression during stimulation-mediated tremor suppression. The metabolic pattern was characterized by covarying increases in the activity of the cerebellum/dentate nucleus and primary motor cortex, and, to a less degree, the caudate/putamen. Vim stimulation resulted in consistent reductions in pattern expression (p<0.005, permutation test). In the absence of stimulation, pattern expression values (subject scores) correlated significantly (r = 0.85, p<0.02) with concurrent accelerometric measurements of tremor amplitude. To validate this spatial covariance pattern as an objective network biomarker of PD tremor, we prospectively quantified its expression on an individual subject basis in independent PD populations. The resulting subject scores for this PD tremor-related pattern (PDTP) were found to exhibit: (1) excellent test retest reproducibility (p<0.0001); (2) significant correlation with independent clinical ratings of tremor (r = 0.54, p<0.001) but not akinesia-rigidity; and (3) significant elevations (p<0.02) in tremor dominant relative to atremulous PD patients. Following validation, we assessed the natural history of PDTP expression in early stage patients scanned longitudinally with FDG PET over a 4-year interval. Significant increases in PDTP expression (p<0.01) were evident in this cohort over time; rate of progression, however, was slower than for the PD-related aldnesia/rigidity pattern (PDRP). We also determined whether PDTP expression is modulated by interventions specifically directed at parkinsonian tremor. While Vim DBS was associated with changes in PDTP (p<0.001) but not PDRP expression, subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS reduced the activity of both networks (p<0.05). PDTP expression was suppressed more by Vim than by STN stimulation (p<0.05). These findings suggest that parkinsonian tremor is mediated by a distinct metabolic network involving primarily cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways. Indeed, effective treatment of this symptom is associated with significant reduction in PDTP expression. Quantification of treatment-mediated changes in both PDTP and PDRP scores can provide an objective means of evaluating the differential effects of novel antiparkinsonian interventions on the different motor features of the disorder.

558,555,"Temporal discounting (TD) matures with age, alongside other markers of increased impulse control, and coherent, self-regulated behaviour. Discounting paradigms quantify the ability to refrain from preference of immediate rewards, in favour of delayed, larger rewards. As such, they measure temporal foresight and the ability to delay gratification, functions that develop slowly into adulthood. We investigated the neural maturation that accompanies the previously observed age-related behavioural changes in discounting, from early adolescence into mid-adulthood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of a hypothetical discounting task with monetary rewards delayed in the week to year range. We show that age-related reductions in choice impulsivity were associated with changes in activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum (VS), insula, inferior temporal gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex. Limbic frontostriatal activation changes were specifically associated with age-dependent reductions in impulsive choice, as part of a more extensive network of brain areas showing age-related changes in activation, including dorsolateral PFC, inferior parietal cortex, and subcortical areas. The maturational pattern of functional connectivity included strengthening in activation coupling between ventromedial and dorsolateral PFC, parietal and insular cortices during selection of delayed alternatives, and between vmPFC and VS during selection of immediate alternatives. We conclude that maturational mechanisms within limbic frontostriatal circuitry underlie the observed post-pubertal reductions in impulsive choice with increasing age, and that this effect is dependent on increased activation coherence within a network of areas associated with discounting behaviour and inter-temporal decision-making.

Much less is known about body postures or about the processing of dynamic images. We undertook a systematic comparison of the neurofunctional network dedicated to processing facial and bodily expressions. Two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments investigated whether areas involved in processing social signals are activated differently by threatening signals (fear and anger) from facial or bodily expressions. The amygdala (AMG) was more active for facial than for bodily expressions. Body stimuli triggered higher activation than face stimuli in a number of areas. These were the cuneus, fusiform gyrus (FG), extrastriate body area (EBA), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior parietal lobule (SPL), primary somatosensory cortex (SI), as well as the thalamus. Emotion-specific effects were found in TPJ and FG for bodies and faces alike. EBA and superior temporal sulcus (STS) were more activated by threatening bodies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

562,559,"Based upon previous reports of alterations in white matter integrity and gray matter density in smokers, we examined these markers in a large, well-matched sample of smokers and non-smokers. We further investigated the effect of heavy cigarette exposure by using pack-years and the effects of two relatively stable, highly heritable traits in smokers (Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FIND), a measure of severity of nicotine dependence and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), a stable personality trait related to smoking). Forty-eight nicotine-dependent subjects and 48 matched controls were included in the analyses, with smokers also subdivided into high/low dependence and high/low pack-years smokers. White matter integrity (fractional anisotropy (FA)) and gray matter density (voxel-based morphometry (VBM)) were measured and compared across groups. Gray matter density was lower in left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in high pack-years smokers and was inversely related to pack-years. In contrast, left insular cortex gray matter density was higher in smokers and associated with TAS-20 total score and with difficulty-identifying-feelings factor. Further, the most highly dependent smokers showed lower prefrontal FA, which was negatively correlated with FEND. There was no correlation between pack-years and FIND in our smoker population. These data suggest chronic tobacco use is correlated with prefrontal gray matter damage, while differences in insula gray matter and PFC white matter appear to reflect stable and heritable differences between smokers and non-smokers.

The latency, amplitude and scalp topography of such responses are considered a reflection of cortico-cortical connectivity and functional state. The aim of the present study is to better characterize the neuronal circuits underlying motor cortex connectivity as well as the mechanisms regulating its balance between inhibition and facilitation by means of EEG navigated-ppTMS coregistration. Methods: Sub-threshold and supra-threshold single and ppTMS of the left primary motor cortex were carried out during a multi-channel EEG recording on 8 healthy volunteers; the between-pulse intervals used in the paired pulse trials were 3 (for SICI) and 11 ms (for ICF). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the opposite hand were simultaneously recorded. Results: Single and ppTMS induced EEG responses characterized by a sequence of negative deflections peaking at approximately 7, 18, 44, 100 and 280 ms alternated with positive peaks at approximately 13, 30, 60 and 190 ms post-TMS. Moreover, ppTMS modulated both EEG evoked activity and MEPs. Amplitude variability of EEG responses was correlated with and therefore might partially explain amplitude variability of MEPs.

564,561,"The vegetative (VS) and minimally conscious (MCS) states are currently distinguished on the basis of exhibited behaviour rather than underlying pathology. Although previous histopathological studies have documented different degrees of diffuse axonal injury as well as damage to the thalami and brainstem regions in VS and MCS, these differences have not been assessed in vivo, and therefore, do not provide a measurable pathological marker to aid clinical diagnosis. Currently, the diagnostic decision-making process is highly subjective and prone to error. Indeed, previous work has suggested that up to 43% of patients in this group may be misdiagnosed. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the neuropathology of 25 vegetative and minimally conscious patients in vivo and to identify measures that could potentially distinguish the patients in these two groups. Mean diffusivity (MD) maps of the subcortical white matter, brainstem and thalami were generated. The MCS and VS patients differed significantly in subcortical white matter and thalamic regions, but appeared not to differ in the brainstem. Moreover, the DTI results predicted scores on the Coma Recovery Scale (p<0.001) and successfully classified the patients in to their appropriate diagnostic categories with an accuracy of 95%. The results suggest that this method may provide an objective and highly accurate method for classifying these challenging patient populations and may therefore complement the behavioural assessment to inform the diagnostic decision making process.

567,564,"Error detection and behavioral adjustment are core components of cognitive control. Numerous studies have focused on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a critical locus of this executive function. Our previous work showed greater activation in the dorsal ACC and subcortical structures during error detection, and activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during post-error slowing (PES) in a stop signal task (SST). However, the extent of error-related cortical or subcortical activation across subjects was not correlated with VLPFC activity during PES. So then, what causes VLPFC activation during PES? To address this question, we employed Granger causality mapping (GCM) and identified regions that Granger caused VLPFC activation in 54 adults performing the SST during fMRI. These brain regions, including the supplementary motor area (SMA), cerebellum, a pontine region, and medial thalamus, represent potential targets responding to errors in a way that could influence VLPFC activation. In confirmation of this hypothesis, the error-related activity of these regions correlated with VLPFC activation during PES, with the cerebellum showing the strongest association. The finding that cerebellar activation Granger causes prefrontal activity during behavioral adjustment supports a cerebellar function in cognitive control. Furthermore, multivariate GCA described the ""flow of information"" across these brain regions. Through connectivity with the thalamus and SMA, the cerebellum mediates error and post-error processing in accord with known anatomical projections. Taken together, these new findings highlight the role of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway in an executive function that has heretofore largely been ascribed to the anterior cingulate-prefrontal cortical circuit.

568,565,"The last decade has seen considerable discussion regarding a theoretical account of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) function with particular focus on the anterior cingulate cortex. The proposed theories have included conflict detection, error likelihood prediction, volatility monitoring, and several distinct theories of error detection. Arguments for and against particular theories often treat mPFC as functionally homogeneous, or at least nearly so, despite some evidence for distinct functional subregions. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to simultaneously contrast multiple effects of error, conflict, and task-switching that have been individually construed in support of various theories. We found overlapping yet functionally distinct subregions of mPFC, with activations related to dominant error, conflict, and task-switching effects successively found along a rostral-ventral to caudal-dorsal gradient within medial prefrontal cortex. Activations in the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) were strongly correlated with the unexpectedness of outcomes suggesting a role in outcome prediction and preparing control systems to deal with anticipated outcomes. The results as a whole support a resolution of some ongoing debates in that distinct theories may each pertain to corresponding distinct yet overlapping subregions of mPFC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here we test the hypothesis that APOE influences brain aging by comparing healthy epsilon 4-carriers and non-carriers, using the same imaging protocol in distinct groups of younger and older healthy volunteers. A cross-sectional factorial design was used to examine the effects of age and APOE genotype, and their interaction, on fMRI activation during an encoding memory task. The younger (N=36; age range 20-35; 18 epsilon 4-carriers) and older (35 middle-age/elderly; age range 50-78 years; 15 epsilon 4-carriers) healthy volunteers taking part in the study were cognitively normal. We found a significant interaction between age and epsilon 4-status in the hippocampi, frontal pole, subcortical nuclei, middle temporal gyri and cerebellum, such that aging was associated with decreased activity in e4-carriers and increased activity in non-carriers. Reduced cerebral blood flow was found in the older epsilon 4-carriers relative to older non-carriers despite preserved grey matter volume. Overactivity of brain function in young epsilon 4-carriers is disproportionately reduced with advancing age even before the onset of measurable memory impairment. The APOE genotype determines age-related changes in brain function that may reflect the increased vulnerability of epsilon 4-carriers to late-life pathology or cognitive decline.

570,567,"Recent evidence suggests that a rapid, automatic face detection system is supported by subcortical structures including the amygdala, pulvinar, and superior colliculus. Early-emerging abnormalities in these structures may be related to reduced social orienting in children with autism, and subsequently, to aberrant development of cortical circuits involved in face processing. Our objective was to determine whether functional abnormalities in the subcortical face processing system are present in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) during supraliminal fearful face processing. Participants included twenty-eight individuals with ASD and 25 controls group-matched on age, IQ and behavioral performance. The ASD group met diagnostic criteria on the ADI-R, ADOS-G, and DSM-IV. Both the ASD and control groups showed significant activation in bilateral fusiform gyri. The control group exhibited additional significant responses in the right amygdala, right pulvinar, and bilateral superior colliculi. In the direct group comparison, the controls showed significantly greater activation in the left amygdala, bilateral fusiform gyrus, right pulvinar, and bilateral superior colliculi. No brain region showed significantly greater activation in the ASD group compared to the controls. Thus, basic rapid face identification mechanisms appear to be functional in ASD. However, individuals with ASD failed to engage the subcortical brain regions involved in face detection and automatic emotional face processing, suggesting a core mechanism for impaired socioemotional processing in ASD. Neural abnormalities in this system may contribute to early-emerging deficits in social orienting and attention, the putative precursors to abnormalities in social cognition and cortical face processing specialization.

571,568,"Nanotechnology is the design and assembly of submicroscopic devices called nanoparticles, which are 1-100 nm in diameter. Nanomedicine is the application of nanotechnology for the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. Disease-specific receptors on the surface of cells provide useful targets for nanoparticles. Because nanoparticles can be engineered from components that (1) recognize disease at the cellular level, (2) are visible on imaging studies, and (3) deliver therapeutic compounds, nanotechnology is well suited for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of diseases. Nanotechnology will enable earlier detection and treatment of diseases that are best treated in their initial stages, such as cancer. Advances in nanotechnology will also spur the discovery of new methods for delivery of therapeutic compounds, including genes and proteins, to diseased tissue. A myriad of nanostructured drugs with effective site-targeting can be developed by combining a diverse selection of targeting, diagnostic, and therapeutic components. Incorporating immune target specificity with nanostructures introduces a new type of treatment modality, nano-immunochemotherapy, for patients with cancer. In this review, we will discuss the development and potential applications of nanoscale platforms in medical diagnosis and treatment. To impact the care of patients with neurological diseases, advances in nanotechnology will require accelerated translation to the fields of brain mapping, CNS imaging, and nanoneurosurgery. Advances in nanoplatform, nano-imaging, and nano-drug delivery will drive the future development of nanomedicine, personalized medicine, and targeted therapy. We believe that the formation of a science, technology, medicine law-healthcare policy (STML) hub/center, which encourages collaboration among universities, medical centers, US government, industry, patient advocacy groups, charitable foundations, and philanthropists, could significantly facilitate such advancements and contribute to the translation of nanotechnology across medical disciplines.

Current visualization of A beta plaques in brains of live patients and animal models is limited in specificity and resolution. The retina as an extension of the brain presents an appealing target for a live, noninvasive optical imaging of AD if disease pathology is manifested there. We identified retinal A beta plaques in postmortem eyes from AD patients (n = 8) and in suspected early stage cases (n=5), consistent with brain pathology and clinical reports; plaques were undetectable in age-matched non-AD individuals (n = 5). In APP(SWE)/PS1(Delta E9) transgenic mice (AD-Tg; n = 18) but not in non-Tg wt mice (n = 10), retinal A beta plaques were detected following systemic administration of curcumin, a safe plaque-labeling fluorochrome. Moreover, retinal plaques were detectable earlier than in the brain and accumulated with disease progression. An immune-based therapy effective in reducing brain plaques, significantly reduced retinal A beta plaque burden in immunized versus non-immunized AD mice (n = 4 mice per group). In live AD-Tg mice (n = 24), systemic administration of curcumin allowed noninvasive optical imaging of retinal A beta plaques in vivo with high resolution and specificity; plaques were undetectable in non-Tg wt mice (n = 11). Our discovery of A beta specific plaques in retinas from AD patients, and the ability to noninvasively detect individual retinal plaques in live AD mice establish the basis for developing high-resolution optical imaging for early AD diagnosis, prognosis assessment and response to therapies.

Blast exposure is among the most common causes of concussion in OEF-OIF warriors. Although the mechanism is unknown, major depressive disorder (MDD) after head injury is common. The purpose of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the structural and functional neural correlates of MDD in OEF-OIF combat veterans with a self-reported history of blast-related concussion. We hypothesized that subjects in the MDD group (i.e., individuals with a history of blast-related concussion who were experiencing current MDD) relative to individuals in the non-MDD group (i.e., individuals with a history of blast-related concussion but no current or lifetime history of MDD) would show amygdala hyperactivity and disruption of white matter tracts connecting prefrontal and limbic brain regions. To test these hypotheses, 11 MDD and 11 non-MDD individuals underwent DTI and performed a validated emotional face matching task during fMRI. MDD relative to non-MDD individuals showed greater activity during fear matching trials in the amygdala and other emotion processing structures, lower activity during fear matching trials in emotional control structures such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in several white matter tracts including the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Greater depressive symptom severity correlated negatively with FA in the SLF.

574,571,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) potentially induced by blast waves from detonations result in significant diagnostic problems. It may be assumed that several mechanisms contribute to the injury. This study is an attempt to characterize the presumed components of the blast induced TBI. Our experimental models include a blast tube in which an anesthetized rat can be exposed to controlled detonations of explosives that result in a pressure wave with a magnitude between 130 and 260 kPa. In this model, the animal is fixed with a metal net to avoid head acceleration forces. The second model is a controlled penetration of a 2 mm thick needle. In the third model the animal is subjected to a high-speed sagittal rotation angular acceleration. Immunohistochemical labeling for amyloid precursor protein revealed signs of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in the penetration and rotation models. Signs of punctuate inflammation were observed after focal and rotation injury. Exposure in the blast tube did not induce DAI or detectable cell death, but functional changes. Affymetrix Gene arrays showed changes in the expression in a large number of gene families including cell death, inflammation and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus after both acceleration and penetration injuries. Exposure to the primary blast wave induced limited shifts in gene expression in the hippocampus. The most interesting findings were a downregulation of genes involved in neurogenesis and synaptic transmission. These experiments indicate that rotational acceleration may be a critical factor for DAI and other acute changes after blast TBI. The further exploration of the mechanisms of blast TBI will have to include a search for long-term effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

575,572,"Non-impact blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) appears to be present in soldiers returning from deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. Although mTBI typically results in cognitive deficits that last less than a month, there is evidence that disrupted coordination of brain activity can persist for at least several months following injury (Thatcher et al., 1989, 2001). In the present study we examined whether neural communication may be affected in soldiers months after blast-related mTBI, and whether coordination of neural function is associated with underlying white matter integrity. The investigation included an application of a new time-frequency based method for measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) phase synchronization (Aviyente et al., 2010) as well as fractional anisotropy measures of axonal tracts derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nine soldiers who incurred a blast-related mTBI during deployments to Afghanistan or Iraq were compared with eight demographically similar control subjects. Despite an absence of cognitive deficits, the blast-related mTBI group exhibited diminished EEG phase synchrony of lateral frontal sites with contralateral frontal brain regions suggesting diminished interhemispheric coordination of brain activity as a result of blast injury. For blast injured (i.e., blast-related mTBI) soldiers we found that EEG phase synchrony was associated with the structural integrity of white matter tracts of the frontal lobe (left anterior thalamic radiations and the forceps minor including the anterior corpus callosum). Analyses revealed that diminished EEG phase synchrony was not the consequence of combat-stress symptoms (e. g., post-traumatic stress and depression) and commonly prescribed medications.

577,574,"Abnormal interactions between areas of the brain have been pointed as possible causes for schizophrenia. However, the nature of these disturbances and the anatomical location of the regions involved are still unclear. Here, we describe a method to estimate maps of net levels of connectivity in the resting brain, and we apply it to look for differential patterns of connectivity in schizophrenia. This method uses partial coherences as a basic measure of covariability, and it minimises the effect of major physiological noise. When overall (net) connectivity maps of a sample of 40 patients with schizophrenia were compared with the maps from a matched sample of 40 controls, a single area of abnormality was found. It is an area of patient hyper-connectivity and is located frontally, in medial and orbital structures, clearly overlapping the anterior node of the default mode network (DMN). When this area is used as a region of interest in a second-level analysis, it shows functional hyper-connections with several cortical and subcortical structures. Interestingly, the most significant abnormality is found with the caudate, which has a bilateral pattern of abnormality, pointing to a possible DMN-striatum deviant relation in schizophrenia. However, hyper-connectivity observed with other regions (right hippocampus and amygdala, and other cortical structures) suggests a more pervasive alteration of brain connectivity in this disease.

578,575,"Neural network breakdown is a key issue in neurodegenerative disease, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we investigated patterns of brain atrophy produced by defined molecular lesions in the two common forms of genetically mediated frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Nine patients with progranulin (GRN) mutations and eleven patients with microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutations had T1 MR brain imaging. Brain volumetry and grey and white matter voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were used to assess patterns of cross-sectional atrophy in the two groups. In a subset of patients with longitudinal MRI rates of whole-brain atrophy were derived using the brain-boundary-shift integral and a VBM-like analysis of voxel-wise longitudinal volume change was performed. The GRN mutation group showed asymmetrical atrophy whereas the MAPT group showed symmetrical atrophy. Brain volumes were smaller in the GRN group with a faster rate of whole-brain atrophy. VBM delineated a common anterior cingulate-prefrontal-insular pattern of atrophy in both disease groups. Additional disease-specific profiles of grey and white matter loss were identified on both cross-sectional and longitudinal imaging: GRN mutations were associated with asymmetrical inferior frontal, temporal and inferior parietal lobe grey matter atrophy and involvement of long intrahemispheric association white matter tracts, whereas MAPT mutations were associated with symmetrical anteromedial temporal lobe and orbitofrontal grey matter atrophy and fornix involvement. The findings suggest that the effects of GRN and MAPT mutations are expressed in partly overlapping but distinct anatomical networks that link specific molecular dysfunction with clinical phenotype.

We performed heritability, genetic correlation and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses for the whole-brain and 10 major cerebral WM tracts. Average measurements for fractional anisotropy (FA), radial (L-perpendicular to) and axial (L-parallel to) diffusivities served as quantitative traits. These analyses were done in 467 healthy individuals (182 males/285 females; average age 47.9 +/- 13.5 years; age range: 19-85 years), recruited from randomly-ascertained pedigrees of extended families. Significant heritability was observed for FA (h(2) = 0.52 +/- 0.11; p=10(-7)) and L-perpendicular to (h(2) = 0.37 +/- 0.14; p=0.001), while L-parallel to measurements were not significantly heritable (h(2)= 0.09 +/- 0.12; p = 0.20). Genetic correlation analysis indicated that the FA and L-perpendicular to shared 46% of the genetic variance. Tract-wise analysis revealed a regionally diverse pattern of genetic control, which was unrelated to ontogenic factors, such as tract-wise age-of-peak FA values and rates of age-related change in FA. QTL analysis indicated linkages for whole-brain average FA (LOD = 2.36) at the marker D15S816 on chromosome 15q25, and for L-perpendicular to (LOD = 2.24) near the marker D3S1754 on the chromosome 3q27. These sites have been reported to have significant co-inheritance with two psychiatric disorders (major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder) in which patients show characteristic alterations in cerebral WM.

Recent advances in neuroimaging and genetics have allowed collection of both highly detailed structural brain scans and genome-wide genotype information. This wealth of information presents a new opportunity to find the genes influencing brain structure. Here we explore the relation between 448,293 single nucleotide polymorphisms in each of 31,622 voxels of the entire brain across 740 elderly subjects (mean age +/- s.d.: 75.52 +/- 6.82 years; 438 male) including subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and healthy elderly controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used tensor-based morphometry to measure individual differences in brain structure at the voxel level relative to a study-specific template based on healthy elderly subjects. We then conducted a genome-wide association at each voxel to identify genetic variants of interest. By studying only the most associated variant at each voxel, we developed a novel method to address the multiple comparisons problem and computational burden associated with the unprecedented amount of data. No variant survived the strict significance criterion, but several genes worthy of further exploration were identified, including CSMD2 and CADPS2. These genes have high relevance to brain structure. This is the first voxelwise genome wide association study to our knowledge, and offers a novel method to discover genetic influences on brain structure. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As part of this work, a novel high-pass filtering methodology was introduced to remove background fields from field maps based on phase data The optimised methods were successfully applied to high-resolution (0 7 mm isotropic) whole-brain modulus and phase data acquired in vivo from five healthy male subjects, 25-30 years of age The multiple-orientation method yielded high quality susceptibility maps. out-performing the single-orientation methods Venous blood vessels as well as the substantia nigra and globus pallidus brain regions showed particularly high positive susceptibility offsets relative to surrounding tissue, consistent with high deoxyhemoglobin and non-heme iron content, respectively To compare the performance of the different methods, regions of interest were drawn in deep grey matter structures and in cortical grey and white matter The threshold-based approach was fast and simple to use, but underestimated susceptibility differences and showed significant artefacts due to noise amplification in difficult regions of k-space The regularised single-orientation method yielded contrast dependent on the choice of spatial priors, but demonstrated the potential to yield susceptibility maps of a similar quality to those calculated using data acquired at multiple orientations to the field.

We aimed to describe the impact of WMLs on white matter pathways in MD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer imaging. As a novel approach, we used DTI tractography to assess pathways intersected by WMLs. We examined 22 patients with late-onset MD and 22 age- and gender-matched controls. Parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were obtained to describe tissue integrity. The association between depression severity and the tract-specific localization of WMLs was analyzed on a voxel-by-voxel basis. We showed a significant positive association between depression severity and fiber tracts intersected by WMLs in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the right uncinate fasciculus. In both groups, WMLs had significantly lower FA and MTR, and higher ADC than both the tracts they intersected and the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). In turn, the tracts intersected by WMLs had significantly lower FA and higher ADC than the NAWM. In conclusion, depression severity correlates with the tract-specific localization of WMLs. WMLs have a pronounced effect on white matter integrity in the pathways they intersect. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

584,581,"Episodic memory is a core feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Impaired episodic memory in AD results from the dysfunction of an integrated network and involves both gray and white matter pathologies. We explored the neural correlates of episodic memory in AD, MCI and healthy aging by correlating a measure of episodic memory with hippocampal volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the cingulum and fornix. Episodic memory was associated with hippocampal volume and MD of the cingulum and fornix. In contrast, there were fewer significant associations between episodic memory and FA. These findings support a relationship between episodic memory and hippocampal circuitry, and suggest that MD is a more sensitive marker of decreased white matter integrity in the study of AD and MCI than FA. Furthermore, MD was significantly associated with hippocampal volume, indicating that white matter pathology is not completely independent of gray matter pathology. However, the pattern of diffusivity differences in AD and MCI implies a more complex pathology than simply Wallerian degeneration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

585,582,"A number of studies have investigated differences in neural correlates of abstract and concrete concepts with disagreement across results. A quantitative, coordinate-based meta-analysis combined data from 303 participants across 19 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies to identify the differences in neural representation of abstract and concrete concepts. Studies that reported peak activations in standard space in contrast of abstract > concrete or concrete > abstract concepts at a whole brain level in healthy adults were included in this meta-analysis. Multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) was performed to identify the proportion of activated contrasts weighted by sample size and analysis type (fixed or random effects). Meta-analysis results indicated consistent and meaningful differences in neural representation for abstract and concrete concepts. Abstract concepts elicit greater activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts, while concrete concepts elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus compared to abstract concepts. These results suggest greater engagement of the verbal system for processing of abstract concepts and greater engagement of the perceptual system for processing of concrete concepts, likely via mental imagery.

586,583,"A face-selective neural signal is reliably found in humans with functional MRI and event-related potential (ERP) measures, which provide complementary information about the spatial and temporal properties of the neural response. However, because most neuroimaging studies so far have studied ERP and fMRI face-selective markers separately, the relationship between them is still unknown. Here we simultaneously recorded fMRI and ERP responses to faces and chairs to examine the correlations across subjects between the magnitudes of fMRI and ERP face-selectivity measures. Findings show that the face-selective responses in the temporal lobe (i.e., fusiform gyrus-FFA) and superior temporal sulcus (fSTS), but not the face-selective response in the occipital cortex (OFA), were highly correlated with the face-selective N170 component. In contrast, the OFA was correlated with earlier ERPs at about 110 ms after stimulus-onset. Importantly, these correlations reveal a temporal dissociation between the face-selective area in the occipital lobe and face-selective areas in the temporal lobe. Despite the very different time-scale of the fMRI and EEG signals, our data show that a correlation analysis across subjects may be informative with respect to the latency in which different brain regions process information.

In this paper, we propose an automated approach for reconstruction of a large number of white matter tracts. In this approach, existing anatomical knowledge about tract trajectories (called the Template ROI Set or TRS) were stored in our DTI-based brain atlas with 130 three-dimensional anatomical segmentations, which were warped non-linearly to individual DTI data. We examined the degree of matching with manual results for selected fibers. We established 30 TRSs to reconstruct 30 prominent and previously well-described fibers.

589,586,"With sufficient image encoding, high-resolution fMRI studies are limited by the biological point-spread of the hemodynamic signal. The extent of this spread is determined by the local vascular distribution and by the spatial specificity of blood flow regulation, as well as by measurement parameters that (i) alter the relative sensitivity of the acquisition to activation-induced hemodynamic changes and (ii) determine the image contrast as a function of vessel size. In particular, large draining vessels on the cortical surface are a major contributor to both the BOLD signal change and to the spatial bias of the BOLD activation away from the site of neuronal activity. In this work, we introduce a laminar surface-based analysis method and study the relationship between spatial localization and activation strength as a function of laminar depth by acquiring 1 mm isotropic, single-shot EPI at 7 T and sampling the BOLD signal exclusively from the superficial, middle, or deep cortical laminae. We show that highly-accelerated EPI can limit image distortions to the point where a boundary-based registration algorithm accurately aligns the EPI data to the surface reconstruction. The spatial spread of the BOLD response tangential to the cortical surface was analyzed as a function of cortical depth using our surface-based analysis. Although sampling near the pial surface provided the highest signal strength, it also introduced the most spatial error. Thus, avoiding surface laminae improved spatial localization by about 40% at a cost of 36% in z-statistic, implying that optimal spatial resolution in functional imaging of the cortex can be achieved using anatomically-informed spatial sampling to avoid large pial vessels.

HC and AG labels, defined on the template are mapped through the inverse transformation to segment these structures on the subject's MRI. 2) We select the most similar MRI from the set of 80 labeled datasets to use as a template in the standard ANIMAL segmentation scheme. 3) We use label fusion techniques to combine segmentations from the 'n' most similar templates.

592,589,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has identified face- and body part-selective regions, as well as distributed activation patterns for object categories across human ventral temporal cortex (VTC), eliciting a debate regarding functional organization in VTC and neural coding of object categories. Using high-resolution fMRI, we illustrate that face- and limb-selective activations alternate in a series of largely nonoverlapping clusters in lateral VTC along the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), fusiform gyrus (FG), and occipito-temporal sulcus (OTS). Both general linear model (GLM) and multivoxel pattern (MVP) analyses show that face- and limb-selective activations minimally overlap and that this organization is consistent across experiments and days. We provide a reliable method to separate two face-selective clusters on the middle and posterior FG (mFus and pFus), and another on the IOG using their spatial relation to limb-selective activations and retinotopic areas hV4, VO-1/2, and hMT+. Furthermore, these activations show a gradient of increasing face selectivity and decreasing limb selectivity from the IOG to the mFus. Finally, MVP analyses indicate that there is differential information for faces in lateral VTC (containing weakly- and highly-selective voxels) relative to non-selective voxels in medial VTC. These findings suggest a sparsely-distributed organization where sparseness refers to the presence of several face- and limb-selective clusters in VTC, and distributed refers to the presence of different amounts of information in highly-, weakly-, and non-selective voxels. Consequently, theories of object recognition should consider the functional and spatial constraints of neural coding across a series of minimally overlapping category-selective clusters that are themselves distributed.

593,590,"Successful behavior requires a finely-tuned interplay of initiating and inhibiting motor programs to react effectively to constantly changing environmental demands. One particularly useful paradigm for investigating inhibitory motor control is the Stop-signal task, where already-initiated responses to Go-stimuli are to be inhibited upon the rapid subsequent presentation of a Stop-stimulus (yielding successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials). Despite the extensive use of this paradigm in functional neuroimaging, there is no consensus on which functional comparison to use to characterize response-inhibition-related brain activity. Here, we utilize conjunction analyses of successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials that are each contrasted against a reference condition. This conjunction approach identifies processes common to both Stop-trial types while excluding processes specific to either, thereby capitalizing on the presence of some response-inhibition-related activity in both conditions. Using this approach on fMRI data from human subjects, we identify a network of brain structures that was linked to both types of Stop-trials, including lateral-inferior frontal and medial frontal cortical areas and the caudate nucleus. In addition, comparisons with a reference condition matched for visual stimulation identified additional activity in the right inferior parietal cortex that may play a role in enhancing the processing of the Stop-stimuli. Finally, differences in stopping efficacy across subjects were associated with variations in activity in the left anterior insula. However, this region was also associated with general task accuracy (which furthermore correlated directly with stopping efficacy), suggesting that it might actually reflect a more general mechanism of performance control that supports response inhibition in a relatively nonspecific way.

594,591,"Although amygdala and frontal lobe functional abnormalities have been reported in patients with mood disorders, the literature regarding major depressive disorder (MDD) is inconsistent. Likely confounds include heterogeneity of patient samples, medication status, and analytic approach. This study evaluated the amygdala and frontal lobe activation in unmedicated MDD patients. Fifteen MDD patients and 15 matched healthy controls were scanned using fMRI during the performance of an emotional face task known to robustly activate the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whole-brain and region of interest analyses were performed, and correlations between clinical features and activation were examined. Significant amygdala and lateral PFC activation were seen within patient and control groups. In a between-group comparison, patients showed significantly reduced activation in the insula, temporal and occipital cortices. In MDD, the presence of anxiety symptoms was associated with decreased orbitofrontal activation. We found robust activation in both the MOD and control groups in fronto-limbic regions with no significant between-group differences using either analytic approach. The current study replicates previous research on unmedicated subjects showing no significant differences in amygdala function in depressed vs. control subjects with respect to simple tasks involving emotion observation.

(2) To determine if measurements of hippocampal subfields provide advantages over total hippocampal volume for differentiation between groups Methods. Ninety-one subjects (53 controls (mean age: 69 3 +/- 73), 20 MCI (mean age: 73.6 +/- 7 1), and 18 AD (mean age: 69 1 +/- 9.5) were studied with a high-resolution T2 weighted imaging sequence aimed at the hippocampus Entorhinal cortex (ERC), subiculum, CA1, CA1-CA2 transition zone (CA1-2), CA3 & dentate gyrus (CA3&DG) were manually marked in the anterior third of the hippocampal body. Hippocampal volume was obtained from the Freesurfer and manually edited Results Compared to controls, AD had smaller volumes of ERC, subiculum, CA1, CA1-2, and total hippocampal volumes. MCI had smaller CA1-2 volumes Discriminant analysis and power analysis showed that CA1-2 was superior to total hippocampal volume for distinction between controls and MCI Conclusion. The patterns of subfield atrophy in AD and MCI were consistent with patterns of neuronal cell loss/reduced synaptic density described by histopathology. These preliminary findings suggest that hippocampal subfield volumetry might be a better measure for diagnosis of early AD and for detection of other disease effects than measurement of total hippocampus Hum Brain Mapp 31 1339-1347, 2010 (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss.

597,594,"Speech production demands a number of integrated processing stages. The system must encode the speech motor programs that command movement trajectories of the articulators and monitor transient spatiotemporal variations in auditory and somatosensory feedback. Early models of this system proposed that independent neural regions perform specialized speech processes. As technology advanced, neuroimaging data revealed that the dynamic sensorimotor processes of speech require a distributed set of interacting neural regions. The DIVA (Directions into Velocities of Articulators) neurocomputational model elaborates on early theories, integrating existing data and contemporary ideologies, to provide a mechanistic account of acoustic, kinematic, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on speech acquisition and production. This large-scale neural network model is composed of several interconnected components whose cell activities and synaptic weight strengths are governed by differential equations. Cells in the model are associated with neuroanatomical substrates and have been mapped to locations in Montreal Neurological Institute stereotactic space, providing a means to compare simulated and empirical fMRI data. The DIVA model also provides a computational and neurophysiological framework within which to interpret and organize research on speech acquisition and production in fluent and dysfluent child and adult speakers. The purpose of this review article is to demonstrate how the DIVA model is used to motivate and guide functional imaging studies. We describe how model predictions are evaluated using voxel-based, region-of-interest-based parametric analyses and inter-regional effective connectivity modeling of fMRI data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

598,595,"In this work, we investigated the effect of the regional variability of the hemodynamic response on the sensitivity of Granger causality (GC) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to neuronal causal influences. We simulated fMRI data by convolving a standard canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) with local field potentials (LFPs) acquired from the macaque cortex and manipulated the causal influence and neuronal delays between the LFPs, the hemodynamic delays between the HRFs, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the sampling period (TR) to assess the effect of each of these factors on the detectability of the neuronal delays from GC analysis of fMRI. In our first bivariate implementation, we assumed the worst-case scenario of the hemodynamic delay being at the empirical upper limit of its normal physiological range and opposing the direction of neuronal delay. We found that, in the absence of HRF confounds, even tens of milliseconds of neuronal delays can be inferred from fMRI. However, in the presence of HRF delays which opposed neuronal delays, the minimum detectable neuronal delay was hundreds of milliseconds. In our second multivariate simulation, we mimicked the real situation more closely by using a multivariate network of four time series and assumed the hemodynamic and neuronal delays to be unknown and drawn from a uniform random distribution. The resulting accuracy of detecting the correct multivariate network from fMRI was well above chance and was up to 90% with faster sampling. Generically, under all conditions, faster sampling and low measurement noise improved the sensitivity of GC analysis of fMRI data to neuronal causality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

599,596,"Quantification of normal brain maturation is a crucial step in understanding developmental abnormalities in brain anatomy and function. The aim of this study was to develop atlas-based tools for time-dependent quantitative image analysis, and to characterize the anatomical changes that occur from 2 years of age to adulthood. We used large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping to register diffusion tensor images of normal participants into the common coordinates and used a pre-segmented atlas to segment the entire brain into 176 structures. Both voxel- and atlas-based analyses reported a structure that showed distinctive changes in terms of its volume and diffusivity measures. In the white matter, fractional anisotropy (FA) linearly increased with age in logarithmic scale, while diffusivity indices, such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and axial and radial diffusivity, decreased at a different rate in several regions. The average, variability, and the time course of each measured parameter are incorporated into the atlas, which can be used for automated detection of developmental abnormalities. As a demonstration of future application studies, the brainstem anatomy of cerebral palsy patients was evaluated and the altered anatomy was delineated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

600,597,"Brain asymmetry, or the structural and functional specialization of each brain hemisphere, has fascinated neuroscientists for over a century. Even so, genetic and environmental factors that influence brain asymmetry are largely unknown. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) now allows asymmetry to be studied at a microscopic scale by examining differences in fiber characteristics across hemispheres rather than differences in structure shapes and volumes. Here we analyzed 4 Tesla DTI scans from 374 healthy adults, including 60 monozygotic twin pairs, 45 same-sex dizygotic pairs, and 164 mixed-sex DZ twins and their siblings; mean age: 24.4 years +/- 1.9 SD). All DTI scans were nonlinearly aligned to a geometrically-symmetric, population-based image template. We computed voxel-wise maps of significant asymmetries (left/right differences) for common diffusion measures that reflect fiber integrity (fractional and geodesic anisotropy; FA, GA and mean diffusivity. MD). In quantitative genetic models computed from all same-sex twin pairs (N = 210 subjects), genetic factors accounted for 33% of the variance in asymmetry for the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, 37% for the anterior thalamic radiation, and 20% for the forceps major and uncinate fasciculus (all L>R). Shared environmental factors accounted for around 15% of the variance in asymmetry for the cortico-spinal tract (R>L) and about 10% for the forceps minor (L>R). Sex differences in asymmetry (men>women) were significant, and were greatest in regions with prominent FA asymmetries. These maps identify heritable DTI-derived features, and may empower genome-wide searches for genetic polymorphisms that influence brain asymmetry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

601,598,"Many components of resting-state (RS) FMRI show non-random structure that has little to do with neural connectivity but can covary over multiple brain structures. Some of these signals originate in physiology and others are hardware-related. One artifact discussed herein may be caused by defects in the receive coil array or the RF amplifiers powering it. During a scan, this artifact results in small image intensity shifts in parts of the brain imaged by the affected array components. These shifts introduce artifactual correlations in RS time series on the spatial scale of the coil's sensitivity profile, and can markedly bias RS connectivity results. We show that such a transient artifact can be substantially removed from RS time series by using locally formed regressors from white matter tissue. This is particularly important in arrays with larger numbers of coils, which may generate smaller artifact zones. In such a case, brain-wide average noise estimates would fail to capture the artifact. We also examine the anatomical structure of artifactual variance in RS FMRI time series, by identifying sources that contribute to these signals and where in the brain are they manifested. We consider current methods for reducing confounding sources (or noises) and their effects on connectivity maps, and offer an improved approach (ANATICOR) that can also reduce hardware artifacts.

To define brain mechanisms contributing to this therapeutic effect, we conducted a functional connectivity analysis of resting-state fMRI in 17 abstinent smokers following nicotine replacement in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. We found that individual differences in cognitive withdrawal symptom improvements after nicotine replacement were associated with increased inverse coupling between executive control and default mode brain networks. Furthermore, improvements in withdrawal symptoms were negatively correlated with altered functional connectivity within the default mode network, and with connectivity between the executive control network and regions implicated in reward processing. These findings demonstrate that nicotine administration in abstinent smokers modulates dynamic interactions between large-scale cognitive brain networks in the resting state. We specifically highlight the role of midline and prefrontal network regions in the neurocognitive response to nicotine pharmacotherapy and suggest that altered functional connectivity patterns of these networks reflect their engagement in reward and salience processing during smoking withdrawal.

In the context of an increased antisaccade error rate, ASD participants showed decreased functional connectivity of the FEF and dACC and decreased inhibition-related activation (based on the contrast of antisaccades and prosaccades) in both regions Decreased dACC activation correlated with a higher error rate in both groups, consistent with a role in top-down control. Within the ASD group, increased FEF activation and dACC/FEF functional connectivity were associated with more severe RRB These findings demonstrate functional abnormalities in a circuit critical for volitional ocular motor control in ASD that may contribute to deficient response inhibition and to RRB More generally, our findings suggest reduced cognitive control over behavior by the dACC in ASD (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved",Reduced cognitive control of response inhibition by the anterior cingulate cortex in autism spectrum disorders,2010,NEUROIMAGE,Article,20394829,['fMRI'],1.82,fMRI

Although many studies have shown anatomical and functional abnormalities in children and adolescents, studies with adult patients are rare. Nineteen adults with ADHD (11 ADHD, combined type; 8 ADHD, partially remitted) and 17 controls were included in this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Brain activation was investigated with a continuous performance test (CPT). Impaired activation of a fronto-striatal and a parietal attentional network was observed during the NoGo condition in ADHD subjects. Correlations of reduced activity of the caudate nuclei, the anterior cingulate cortex, and parietal cortical structures, as well as increased activity in the insular cortex, with inattention and impulsivity symptom scores were found. The activation patterns were similar to those known from children and adolescents with ADHD. In conclusion we found not only a widespread dysfunction of brain regions that are involved in cognitive processing in adults with ADHD compared with controls, but also correlations between symptom severity and dysfunction of neuronal systems across adult subjects with a history of ADHD in childhood but whose symptoms did (persistent ADHD) and did not (not persistent ADHD) qualify for a full diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood.

We then modeled the effect of placing a ""stimulating"" electrode with a saline-like conductivity over F3, and a similar ""reference"" electrode over a right supraorbital (RS) location, as well as the complements of these locations, to compare expectations derived from the simulation with experimental data also using these locations in terms of the presence or absence of subjective and objective effects. The sensitivity of the results to changes in conductivity values were examined by varying white matter conductivity over a factor of ten. Our simulations established that high current densities were found directly under the stimulating and reference electrodes, but values of the same order of magnitude occurred in other structures, and many areas of the brain that might be behaviorally active were also subjected to what may be substantial amounts of current. The modeling also suggests that more targeted stimulations might be achieved by different electrode topologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

608,605,"Machine learning and pattern recognition methods have been used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from individual MRI scans. Another application of such methods is to predict clinical scores from individual scans. Using relevance vector regression (RVR), we predicted individuals' performances on established tests from their MRI T1 weighted image in two independent data sets. From Mayo Clinic, 73 probable AD patients and 91 cognitively normal (CN) controls completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) within 3 months of their scan. Baseline MRI's from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) comprised the other data set: 113 AD, 351 MCI, and 122 CN subjects completed the MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subtest (ADAS-cog) and 39 AD, 92 MCI, and 32 CN ADNI subjects completed MMSE. ADAS-cog, and AVLT. Predicted and actual clinical scores were highly correlated for the MMSE, DRS, and ADAS-cog tests (P<0.0001). Training with one data set and testing with another demonstrated stability between data sets. DRS, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog correlated better than AVLT with whole brain grey matter changes associated with AD. This result underscores their utility for screening and tracking disease. RVR offers a novel way to measure interactions between structural changes and neuropsychological tests beyond that of univariate methods. In clinical practice, we envision using RVR to aid in diagnosis and predict clinical outcome. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

609,606,"A central evolutionary challenge for social groups is uniting a heterogeneous set of individuals towards common goals. One means by which social groups form and endure is by endowing group members with extraordinary prosocial proclivities, such as ingroup love, towards other group members. Here we examined the neural basis of extraordinary empathy and altruistic motivation in African-American and Caucasian-American individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results indicate that empathy for ingroup members is neurally distinct from empathy for humankind, more generally. People showed greater response within anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula when observing the suffering of others, but African-American individuals additionally recruit medial prefrontal cortex when observing the suffering of members of their own social group. Moreover, neural activity within medial prefrontal cortex in response to pain expressed by ingroup relative to outgroup members predicted greater empathy and altruistic motivation for one's ingroup, suggesting that neurocognitive processes associated with self identity underlie extraordinary empathy and altruistic motivation for members of one's own social group. Taken together, our findings reveal distinct neural mechanisms of empathy and altruistic motivation in an intergroup context and may serve as a foundation for future research investigating the neural bases of intergroup prosociality, more broadly construed.

This study assessed the effect of multicentre variability of MRI-based hippocampus and amygdala volumetry on the discrimination between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and on the association of morphological changes with ApoE4 genotype and cognition. We studied 113 patients with clinically probable AD and 150 patients with amnestic MCI using high-resolution MRI scans obtained at 12 clinical sites. We determined effect sizes of group discrimination and random effects linear models, considering multicentre variability. Hippocampus and amygdala volumes were significantly reduced in AD compared with MCI patients using data pooled across centres. Multicentre variability did not significantly affect the power to detect a volume difference between AD and MCI patients. Among cognitive measures, delayed recall of verbal and non-verbal material was significantly correlated with hippocampus and amygdala volumes. Amygdala and hippocampus volumes were not associated with ApoE4 genotype in AD or MCI. Our data indicate that multicentre acquisition of MRI data using manual volumetry is reliable and feasible for cross-sectional diagnostic studies, and they replicate essential findings from smaller scale monocentre studies.

However, experimenters face a number of methodological issues, and these issues are particularly pertinent when imaging children. This brief article discusses assessing task performance, strategies for dealing with group performance differences, controlling for movement, statistical power, proper atlas registration, and data analysis strategies. In addition, there will be discussion of two other topics that have important implications for interpreting fMRI data: the question of whether functional neuroanatomical differences between adults and children are the consequence of putative developmental neurovascular differences, and the issue of interpreting negative blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal change.

613,610,"Childhood psychiatric disorders are rarely static; rather they change over time and longitudinal studies are ideally suited to capture such dynamic processes. Using longitudinal data, insights can be gained into the nature of the perturbation away from the trajectory of typical development in childhood disorders. Thus, some disorders may reflect a delay in neurodevelopmental trajectories. Our studies in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest that cortical development is delayed with a rightward shift along the age axis in cortical trajectories, most prominent in prefrontal cortical regions. Other disorders may be characterized by differences in the velocity of trajectories: the basic shape of neurodevelopmental curves remains intact, but with disrupted tempo. Thus, childhood onset schizophrenia is associated with a marked increase during adolescence in the velocity of loss of cerebral gray matter. By contrast, in childhood autism there is an early acceleration of brain growth, which overshoots typical dimensions leading to transient cerebral enlargement. Finally, there may be more profound deviations from typical neurodevelopment, with a complete ""derailing"" of brain growth and a loss of the features which characterize typical brain development. An example is the almost complete silencing of white matter growth during adolescence of patients with childhood onset schizophrenia. Adopting a longitudinal perspective also readily lends itself to the understanding of the neural bases of differential clinical outcomes. Again taking ADHD as an example, we found that remission is associated with convergence to the template of typical development, whereas persistence is accompanied by progressive divergence away from typical trajectories.

614,611,"In a genome-wide association study of structural brain degeneration, we mapped the 3D profile of temporal lobe volume differences in 742 brain MRI scans of Alzheimer's disease patients, mildly impaired, and healthy elderly subjects. After searching 546,314 genomic markers, 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with bilateral temporal lobe volume (P<5 x 10(-7)). One SNP, rs10845840, is located in the GRIN2B gene which encodes the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor NR2B subunit. This protein involved in learning and memory, and excitotoxic cell death - has age-dependent prevalence in the synapse and is already a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. Risk alleles for lower temporal lobe volume at this SNP were significantly over-represented in AD and MCI subjects vs. controls (odds ratio = 1.273; P = 0.039) and were associated with mini-mental state exam scores (MMSE; t = 2.114; P=0.035) demonstrating a negative effect on global cognitive function. Voxelwise maps of genetic association of this SNP with regional brain volumes, revealed intense temporal lobe effects (FDR correction at q=0.05: critical P=0.0257).

616,613,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by specific and progressive reductions in fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl), some of which may precede the onset of symptoms. In this report, we describe twelve-month CMRgl declines in 69 probable AD patients, 154 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 79 cognitively normal controls (NCs) from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). We introduce the use of an empirically pre-defined statistical region-of-interest (sROI) to characterize CMRgl declines with optimal power and freedom from multiple comparisons, and we estimate the number of patients needed to characterize AD-slowing treatment effects in multi-center randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The AD and MCI groups each had significant twelve-month CMRgl declines bilaterally in posterior cingulate, medial and lateral parietal, medial and lateral temporal, frontal and occipital cortex, which were significantly greater than those in the NC group and correlated with measures of clinical decline. Using sROIs defined based on training sets of baseline and follow-up images to assess CMRgl declines in independent test sets from each patient group, we estimate the need for 66 AD patients or 217 MCI patients per treatment group to detect a 25% AD-slowing treatment effect in a twelve-month, multi-center RCT with 80% power and two-tailed alpha = 0.05, roughly one-tenth the number of the patients needed to study MCI patients using clinical endpoints.

617,614,"Spatial normalization of neuroimaging data is a standard step when assessing group effects. As a result of divergent analysis procedures due to different normalization algorithms or templates, not all published coordinates refer to the same neuroanatomical region. Specifically, the literature is populated with results in the form of MNI or Talairach coordinates, and their disparity can impede the comparison of results across different studies. This becomes particularly problematic in coordinate-based meta-analyses, wherein coordinate disparity should be corrected to reduce error and facilitate literature reviews. In this study, a quantitative comparison was performed on two corrections, the Brett transform (i.e., ""mni2tal""), and the Lancaster transform (i.e., ""icbm2tal""). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during a standard paired associates task indicated that the disparity between MNI and Talairach coordinates was better reduced via the Lancaster transform, as compared to the Brett transform. In addition, an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of the paired associates literature revealed that a higher degree of concordance was obtained when using the Lancaster transform in the form of fewer, smaller, and more intense clusters. Based on these results, we recommend that the Lancaster transform be adopted as the community standard for reducing disparity between results reported as MNI or Talairach coordinates, and suggest that future spatial normalization strategies be designed to minimize this variability in the literature.

618,615,"Multivariate pattern recognition methods are increasingly being used to identify multiregional brain activity patterns that collectively discriminate one cognitive condition or experimental group from another, using fMRI data. The performance of these methods is often limited because the number of regions considered in the analysis of fMRI data is large compared to the number of observations (trials or participants). Existing methods that aim to tackle this dimensionality problem are less than optimal because they either over-fit the data or are computationally intractable. Here, we describe a novel method based on logistic regression using a combination of L1 and L2 norm regularization that more accurately estimates discriminative brain regions across multiple conditions or groups. The L1 norm, computed using a fast estimation procedure, ensures a fast, sparse and generalizable solution; the L2 norm ensures that correlated brain regions are included in the resulting solution, a critical aspect of fMRI data analysis often overlooked by existing methods. We first evaluate the performance of our method on simulated data and then examine its effectiveness in discriminating between well-matched music and speech stimuli. We also compared our procedures with other methods which use either L1-norm regularization alone or support vector machine-based feature elimination. On simulated data, our methods performed significantly better than existing methods across a wide range of contrast-to-noise ratios and feature prevalence rates. On experimental fMRI data, our methods were more effective in selectively isolating a distributed fronto-temporal network that distinguished between brain regions known to be involved in speech and music processing. These findings suggest that our method is not only computationally efficient, but it also achieves the twin objectives of identifying relevant discriminative brain regions and accurately classifying fMRI data.

In order to separate their underlying neural and functional mechanisms, the current experiment manipulated both conflict and inhibition. To do so, the go/nogo and stop-signal tasks were merged into one paradigm. Conflict was manipulated by varying go-trial frequencies across blocks (75% vs. 25%). Motor inhibition was manipulated by using go, nogo and stop trials each representing a different load of inhibition. Event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as current density reconstructions (CDRs) of fifteen healthy participants were analyzed. Overall, infrequent trials evoked significantly more pronounced N200s than frequent trials. The P300 predominantly revealed significant variations between trial types (go, nogo, stop). Estimated source activations of the MCC and the IFC supported the ERP results; N200-related effects were revealed in both regions, whereas the condition-specific variations of the P300 were only observed in the IFC. The results indicate that the N200 primarily reflects conflict-related effects whereas the P300 predominantly represents motor inhibition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, despite literature that has proposed the importance of structural connectivity in the brain for creativity, the relationship between regional white matter integrity and creativity has never been directly investigated. In this study, we used diffusion tensor imaging and a behavioral creativity test of divergent thinking to investigate the relationship between creativity and structural connectivity. We examined associations between creativity and fractional anisotropy across the brain in healthy young adult (mean age, 21.7 years old; [SD]=1.44) men (n = 42) and women (n = 13). After controlling for age, sex, and score on Raven's advanced progressive matrices, a test for psychometric measures of intelligence, significant positive relationships between fractional anisotropy and individual creativity as measured by the divergent thinking test were observed in the white matter in or adjacent to the bilateral prefrontal cortices, the body of the corpus callosum, the bilateral basal ganglia, the bilateral temporo-parietal junction and the right inferior parietal lobule. As a whole, these findings indicate that integrated white matter tracts underlie creativity. These pathways involve the association cortices and the corpus callosum, which connect information in distant brain regions and underlie diverse cognitive functions that support creativity. Thus, our results are congruent with the ideas that creativity is associated with the integration of conceptually distant ideas held in different brain domains and architectures and that creativity is supported by diverse high-level cognitive functions, particularly those of the frontal lobe.

A recent evaluation of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods, as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than 16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels, registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following: 1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration; and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods using present resampling methods. From the results of this study, we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template.

626,623,"Automatic anatomical segmentation of magnetic resonance human brain images has been shown to be accurate and robust when based on multiple atlases that encompass the anatomical variability of the cohort of subjects. We observed that the method tends to fail when the segmentation target shows ventricular enlargement that is not captured by the atlas database. By incorporating tissue classification information into the image registration process, we aimed to increase the robustness of the method. For testing, subjects who participated in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Aging (OPTIMA) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were selected for ventriculomegaly. Segmentation quality was substantially improved in the ventricles and surrounding structures (9/9 successes on visual rating versus 4/9 successes using the baseline method). In addition, the modification resulted in a significant increase of segmentation accuracy in healthy subjects' brain images. Hippocampal segmentation results in a group of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were near identical with both approaches. The modified approach (MAPER, multiatlas propagation with enhanced registration) extends the applicability of multi-atlas based automatic whole-brain segmentation to subjects with ventriculomegaly, as seen in normal aging as well as in numerous neurodegenerative diseases.

627,624,"Functional MRI (MI) of default mode network (DMN) brain activity during resting state is gaining attention as a potential non-invasive biomarker to diagnose incipient Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to identify effects of normal aging on the DMN using different methods of fMRI processing and evaluation. Methods. fMRI was acquired in 17 young and 21 old healthy subjects and the data were analyzed with (a) volumes of interest (VOI)-based signal time course and (b) independent component analyses (ICA). In the first approach, the strength of DMN region inter-connectivity (as expressed with correlation coefficients) was of primary interest, the second method provided a measure of the magnitude of DMN co-activation. Results. The older subjects exhibited significantly lower DMN activity in the posterior cingulate (PCC, t-test P<.001) as well as a tendency to lower activity in all other DMN regions in comparison to the younger subjects. We found no significant effect of age on DMN inter-connectivity. Conclusion. Effects of normal aging such as loss of PCC co-activity could be detected by ICA, but not by signal time course correlation analyses of DMN inter-connectivity. This either indicates lower sensitivity of inter-connectivity measures to detect subtle DMN changes or indicate that ICA and time course analyses determine different properties of DMN co-activation. Our results, therefore, provide fundamental knowledge for a potential future use of functional MRI as biomarker for neurodegenerative dementias where diminished DMN activity needs to be reliably differentiated from that observed in health aging.

628,625,"Falkenstein et al. (1991) first described a negative wave occurring just after an erroneous response in choice Reaction time tasks (""Error Negativity""-Ne or ""Error Related Negativity""-ERN). Thanks to Laplacian transform of the data, Vidal et al. (2000, 2003a) described a wave on correct trials with similar topography and latency, although of smaller amplitude compared to the errors. A critical question is whether the Ne observed on errors and the negativity reported on correct trials reflect the same (modulated) activity, or whether they reflect completely different mechanisms. These two alternative possibilities were tested thanks to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and source localization. ICA results showed that the waves recorded on errors and correct trials can be accounted for by the same independent component, corresponding to a dipolar source located within the Rostral Cingulate Zone. Source localization on the raw data also confirmed a common generator for correct and error trials. These data suggest that the waves on errors and correct trials reflect the same brain activity, whose amplitude varies as a function of the correctness of the response. The implications of this result for cognitive control are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

629,626,"Sex differences in emotional responding have been repeatedly postulated but less consistently shown in empirical studies. Because emotional reactions are modulated by cognitive appraisal, sex differences in emotional responding might depend on differences in emotion regulation. In this study, we investigated sex differences in emotional reactivity and emotion regulation using a delayed cognitive reappraisal paradigm and measured whole-brain BOLD signal in 17 men and 16 women. During fMRI, participants were instructed to increase, decrease, or maintain their emotional reactions evoked by negative pictures in terms of cognitive reappraisal. We analyzed BOLD responses to aversive compared to neutral pictures in the initial viewing phase and the effect of cognitive reappraisal in the subsequent regulation phase. Women showed enhanced amygdala responding to aversive stimuli in the initial viewing phase, together with increased activity in small clusters within the prefrontal cortex and the temporal cortex. During cognitively decreasing emotional reactions, women recruited parts of the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to a lesser extent than men, while there was no sex effect on amygdala activity. In contrast, compared to women, men showed an increased recruitment of regulatory cortical areas during cognitively increasing initial emotional reactions, which was associated with an increase in amygdala activity. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed. Hum Brain Mapp 31:758-769, 2010.

630,627,"This article describes the SRI24 atlas, a new standard reference system of normal human brain anatomy, that was created using template-free population registration of high-resolution magnetic resonance images acquired at 3T in a group of 24 normal control subjects. The atlas comprises anatomical channels (T1, T2, and proton density weighted), diffusion-related channels (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, longitudinal diffusivity, mean diffusion-weighted image), tissue channels (CSF probability, gray matter probability, white matter probability, tissue labels), and two cortical parcellation maps. The SRI24 atlas enables multichannel atlas-to-subject image registration. It is uniquely versatile in that it is equally suited for the two fundamentally different atlas applications: label propagation and spatial normalization. Label propagation, herein demonstrated using diffusion tensor image fiber tracking, is enabled by the increased sharpness of the SRI24 atlas compared with other available atlases. Spatial normalization, herein demonstrated using data from a young old group comparison study, is enabled by its unbiased average population shape property. For both propagation and normalization, we also report the results of quantitative comparisons with seven other published atlases: Colin27, MNI152, ICBM452 (warp5 and air12), and LPBA40 (SPM5, FLIRT, AIR). Our results suggest that the SRI24 atlas, although based on 3T MR data, allows equally accurate spatial normalization of data acquired at 1.5T as the comparison atlases, all of which are based on 1.5T data. Furthermore, the SRI24 atlas is as suitable for label propagation as the comparison atlases and detailed enough to allow delineation of anatomical structures for this purpose directly in the atlas.

In this study the whole brain activation and deactivation pattern during real locomotion was investigated by [F-18]FDG-PET and compared to BOLD-signal changes during imagined locomotion in the same subjects using fMRI. Sixteen healthy subjects were scanned at locomotion and rest with [F-18]-FDG-PET. In the locomotion paradigm subjects walked at constant velocity for 10 min. Then [F-18]-FDG was injected intravenously while subjects continued walking for another 10 min. For comparison fMRI was performed in the same subjects during imagined walking. During real and imagined locomotion a basic locomotion network including activations in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, pontomesencephalic tegmentum, parahippocampal, fusiform and occipital gyri, and deactivations in the multisensory vestibular cortices (esp. superior temporal gyros, inferior parietal lobule) was shown. As a difference, the primary motor and somatosensory cortices were activated during real locomotion as distinct to the supplementary motor cortex and basal ganglia during imagined locomotion. Activations of the brainstem locomotor centers were more prominent in imagined locomotion. In conclusion, basic activation and deactivation patterns of real locomotion correspond to that of imagined locomotion. The differences may be due to distinct patterns of locomotion tested.

632,629,"Watching or imagining other people experiencing pain activates the central nervous system's pain matrix in the observer. Without emotion regulation skills, repeated exposure to the suffering of others in healthcare professionals may be associated with the adverse consequences of personal distress, burnout and compassion fatigue, which are detrimental to their wellbeing. Here, we recorded event-related potentials (ERP) from physicians and matched controls as they were presented with visual stimuli depicting body parts pricked by a needle (pain) or touched by a Q-tip (no-pain). The results showed early N110 differentiation between pain and no-pain over the frontal area as well as late P3 over the centro-parietal regions were observed in the control participants. In contrast, no such early and late ERP responses were detected in the physicians. Our results indicate that emotion regulation in physicians has very early effects, inhibiting the bottom-up processing of the perception of pain in others. It is suggested that physicians' down-regulation of the pain response dampens their negative arousal in response to the pain of others and thus may have many beneficial consequences including freeing up cognitive resources necessary for being of assistance.

633,630,"Neuropsychological studies of subjects with bipolar disorder suggest impairment of working memory not only in acute mood states, but also while subjects are euthymic. Using fMRI to probe working memory regions in bipolar subjects in different mood states, we sought to determine the functional neural basis for these impairments. Typical working memory areas in normal populations include dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9/46) and the posterior parietal cortex (BA40). We evaluated the activation in these regions using an n-back task in 42 bipolar subjects (13 manic, 15 euthymic and 14 depressed subjects) and 14 control subjects. While both control and bipolar subjects performed similarly on the task, bipolar subjects in all three mood states showed a significant reduction in activation in right BA9/46 and right BA40. Patients with bipolar disorder exhibit significantly attenuated neural activation in working memory circuits, independent of mood state. The reduction of neural activation may suggest a trait-related deficit. Subjects with bipolar disorder activated other additional frontal and temporal regions, perhaps as a compensatory mechanism, but this remains to be further explored. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

634,631,"In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate age-related changes in large-scale brain functional networks during memory encoding and recognition in 12 younger and 16 older adults. For each participant, functional brain networks were constructed by computing temporal correlation matrices of 90 brain regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. We found the age-related changes mainly in the long-range connections with widespread reductions associated with aging in the fronto-temporal and temporo-parietal regions, and a few age-related increases in the posterior parietal regions. Graph theoretical analysis revealed that the older adults had longer path lengths linking different regions in the functional brain networks as compared to the younger adults. Further analysis indicated that the increases in shortest path length in the networks were combined with the loss of long-range connections. Finally, we showed that for older adults, frontal areas played reduced roles in the network (reduced regional centrality), whereas several default-mode regions played increased roles relative to younger subjects (increased regional centrality). Together, our results suggest that normal aging is associated with disruption of large-scale brain systems during the performance of memory tasks, which provides novel insights into the understanding of age-related decline in multiple cognitive functions.

635,632,"A network of brain regions has been implicated in top-down attentional control, including left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The present experiment evaluated predictions of the cascade-of-control model (Banich, 2009), which predicts that during attentionally-demanding tasks, LDLPFC imposes a top-down attentional set which precedes late-stage selection performed by dACC. Furthermore, the cascade-of-control model argues that dACC must increase its activity to compensate when top-down control by LDLPFC is Poor. The present study tested these hypotheses using fMRI and dense-array ERP data collected from the same 80 participants in separate sessions. fMRI results guided ERP source modeling to characterize the time Course of activity in LDLPFC and dACC. As predicted, dACC activity subsequent to LDLPFC activity distinguished Congruent and incongruent conditions on the Stroop task. Furthermore, when LDLPFC activity was low, the level of dACC activity was related to performance outcome. These results demonstrate that dACC responds to attentional demand in a flexible manner that is dependent on the level of LDLPFC activity earlier in a trial.

636,633,"Risky decision-making is significantly affected by homeostatic states associated with different prior risk experiences, yet the neural mechanisms have not been well understood. Using functional MRI, we examined how gambling decisions and their underlying neural responses were modulated by prior risk experiences, with a focus on the insular cortex since it has been implicated in interoception, emotion and risky decision-making. Fourteen healthy young participants were scanned while performing a gambling task that was designed to simulate daily-life risk taking. Prior risk experience was manipulated by presenting participants with gambles that they were very likely to accept or gambles that they were unlikely to accept. A probe gamble, which was sensitive to individual's risk preference, was presented to examine the effect of prior risk experiences (Risk vs. Norisk) on subsequent risky decisions. Compared to passing on a gamble (Norisk), taking a gamble, especially winning a gamble (Riskwin), was associated with significantly stronger activation in the insular and dorsal medial prefrontal cortices. Decision making after Norisk was more risky and more likely to recruit activation of the insular and anterior cingulate cortices. This insular activity during decision making predicted the extent of risky decisions both within- and across-subjects, and was also correlated with an individual's personality trait of urgency. These findings suggest that the insula plays an important role in activating representations of homeostatic states associated with the experience of risk, which in turn exerts an influence on subsequent decisions.

We focused on neuronal correlates of risk assessment and reward processing. Participants had to decide whether to draw or not to draw a card in a high-risk or low-risk blackjack situation. We assumed PG would show differences in prefrontal and ventral striatal brain regions in comparison to OG during risk assessment and due to the winning or losing of money. Although both groups did not differ in behavioral data, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in PG and OG significantly differed in thalamic, inferior frontal, and superior temporal regions. Whereas PG demonstrated a consistent signal increase during high-risk situations and a decrease in low-risk situations, OG presented the opposite pattern. During reward processing as derived from contrasting winning vs. losing situations, both PG and OG groups showed an enhancement of ventral striatal and posterior cingulate activity. Furthermore, PG demonstrated a distinct fronto-parietal activation pattern which has been discussed to reflect a cue-induced addiction memory network which was triggered by gambling-related cues.

These subjects and 14 non-drug-using control subjects underwent fMRI while performing a working memory task with three levels of difficulty. CD subjects were then randomized to treatment studies. Results showed CD subjects had significantly lower (random effects, corrected for multiple comparisons) brain activation in caudate, putamen, cingulate gyrus, middle and superior frontal gyri, inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis and pars opercularis, precentral gyrus, and thalamus compared with non-drug-using controls.

Whilst automated methods to segment the hippocampus from magnetic resonance images are available, manual segmentation, in spite of being time-consuming and unsuitable for large samples, is still the standard. In order to study the validity of FreeSurfer's automated method, we compared hippocampal automated measures with manual tracing in a sample composed of healthy elderly (N=41), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (N=23), and AD (N=25) subjects. Percent volume overlap, percent volume difference, correlations, and Bland-Altman plots were studied. Automated measures were slightly larger than hand tracing ones (mean difference 10%). Percent volume overlap showed good results, but was far from perfect (78%). Manual and automated volume correlations were approximately 0.84 and the Bland-Altman analysis showed acceptable interchangeability of methods. Within-group analysis demonstrated that patient samples obtained smaller values in validity indexes than controls. Globally, FreeSurfer's automated hippocampal volumetry showed adequate validity when compared to manual tracing, with a tendency to overestimation. Nevertheless, the greater difference between automated and manual segmentation in atrophic brains suggests that studies in AD based on this software could be more likely to produce false negatives.

In this study, we combined quantitative frequency domain near infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS) measures of cerebral tissue oxygenation (StO(2)) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) with diffusion correlation spectroscopy (DCS) measures of a cerebral blood flow index (CBFix) to test the validity of the CBV-CBF relationship in premature neonates and to estimate cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO(2)) with or without the CBFix measurement. We measured 11 premature neonates (28-34 weeks gestational age) without known neurological issues, once a week from one to six weeks of age. In nine patients, cerebral blood velocities from the middle cerebral artery were collected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and compared with DCS values. Results show a steady decrease in StO(2) during the first six weeks of life while CBV remains stable, and a steady increase in CBFix. rCMRO(2) estimated from FD-NIRS remains constant but shows wide interindividual variability. rCMRO(2) calculated from FD-NIRS and DCS combined increased by 40% during the first six weeks of life with reduced interindividual variability.

641,638,"Changes in the default mode network (DMN) have been linked to multiple neurological disorders including schizophrenia. The anticorrelated relationship the DMN shares with task-related networks permits the quantification of this network both during task (task-induced deactivations: TID) and during periods of passive mental activity (extended rest). However, the effects of different methodologies (TID vs. extended rest) for quantifying the DMN in the same clinical population are currently not well understood. Moreover, several different analytic techniques, including independent component analyses (ICA) and seed-based correlation analyses, exist for examining functional connectivity during extended resting states. The current study compared both methodologies and analytic techniques in a group of patients with schizophrenia (SP) and matched healthy controls. Results indicated that TID analyses, ICA, and seed-based correlation all consistently identified the midline (anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus) and lateral parietal cortex as core regions of the DMN, as well as more variable involvement of temporal lobe structures. In addition, SP exhibited increased deactivation during task, as well as decreased functional connectivity with frontal regions and increased connectivity with posterior and subcortical areas during periods of extended rest. The increased posterior and reduced anterior connectivity may partially explain some of the cognitive dysfunction and clinical symptoms that are frequently associated with schizophrenia.

643,640,"Remission is the optimal outcome for major depressive disorder (MDD), but many patients do not improve appreciably despite treatment with medication. Treatment-resistant patients may experience deterioration in cognitive functions. Research has reported structural abnormalities in certain brain areas that may contribute to a poor clinical response. We hypothesize that there will be structural differences between patients able to achieve remission and those responding poorly to antidepressants. In the first voxel-based morphometric (VBM) study comparing remitting with non-remitting MDD, we investigated gray matter volume (GMV) differences between depressives to determine which structural abnormalities existed, and correlated these with diminished cognitive functioning. Of 44 adults with recurrent MDD, 19 had full remissions and 25 were non-remitters after a 6-week trial with antidepressant treatment. Remission was defined by 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores of <= 7 for at least 2 weeks. VBM and neuropsychological studies were conducted on all patients and 25 healthy controls. The patients who remitted revealed milder visual attention deficits than did controls. This correlated with reduced GMV in the left postcentral gyrus (Brodmann area. or BA, 3) and the bilateral medial/superior frontal gyrus (BA 6). The non-remitting patients had reduced GMV in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA 9), and impaired acoustic and visual attention associated with GMV differences in several cortical regions, thalamus and amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus. These findings indicated that patients whose MDD remitted were cognitively and morphologically different from non-remitters. Voxel-based structural deficits in the left DLPFC may characterize a subgroup of people with recurrent MDD who respond poorly to antidepressants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

644,641,"Ten percent of humans lack specific binding of [C-11]PBR28 to 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker for inflammation. ""Non-binders"" have not been reported using another TSPO radioligand, [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195, despite its use for more than two decades. This study asked two questions: (1) What is the cause of nonbinding to PBR28? and (2) Why has this phenomenon not been reported using [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195? Methods: Five binders and five non-binders received whole-body imaging with both [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 and [C-11]PBR28. In vitro binding was performed using leukocyte membranes from binders and non-binders and the tritiated versions of the ligand. Rhesus monkeys were imaged with [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 at baseline and after blockade of TSPOs. Results: Using [C-11]PBR28, uptake in all five organs with high densities of TSPO (lung, heart, brain, kidney, and spleen) was 50% to 75% lower in non-binders than in binders. In contrast, [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 distinguished binders and non-binders in only heart and lung. For the in vitro assay, [H-3]PBR28 had more than 10-fold lower affinity to TSPO in non-binders than in binders. The in vivo specific binding of [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 in monkey brain was similar to 80-fold lower than that reported for [C-11]PBR28. Conclusions: Based on binding of [H-3]PK 11195 to leukocyte membranes, both binders and non-binders express TSPO. Non-binding to PBR28 is caused by its low affinity for TSPO in non-binders. Non-binding may be differentially expressed in organs of the body. The relatively low in vivo specific binding of [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 may have obscured its detection of nonbinding in peripheral organs.

645,642,"The corpus callosum (CC) is the major conduit for information transfer between the cerebral hemispheres and plays an integral role in relaying sensory, motor and cognitive information between homologous cortical regions. The majority of fibers that make up the CC arise from large pyramidal neurons in layers III and V, which project contra-laterally. These neurons degenerate in Huntington's disease (HD) in a topographically and temporally selective way. Since any focus of cortical degeneration could be expected to secondarily deafferent homologous regions of cortex, we hypothesized that regionally selective cortical degeneration would be reflected in regionally selective degeneration of the CC. We used conventional T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and a modified corpus callosum segmentation scheme to examine the CC in healthy controls, huntingtin gene-carriers and symptomatic HID subjects. We measured mid-sagittal callosal cross-sectional thickness and several DTI parameters, including fractional anisotropy (FA), which reflects the degree of white matter organization, radial diffusivity, a suggested index of myelin integrity, and axial diffusivity, a suggested index of axonal damage of the CC. We found a topologically selective pattern of alterations in these measures in pre-manifest subjects that were more extensive in early symptomatic HD subjects and that correlated with performance on distinct cognitive measures, suggesting an important role for disrupted inter-hemispheric transfer in the clinical symptoms of HID. Our findings provide evidence for early degeneration of commissural pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, loss of cortico-cortical connectivity, and functional compromise of associative cortical processing.

647,644,"In this technical note, we describe and validate a topological false discovery rate (FDR) procedure for statistical parametric mapping. This procedure is designed to deal with signal that is continuous and has, in principle, unbounded spatial support. We therefore infer on topological features of the signal, such as the existence of local maxima or peaks above some threshold. Using results from random field theory, we assign a p-value to each maximum in an SPM and identify an adaptive threshold that controls false discovery rate, using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure (1995). This provides a natural complement to conventional family wise error (FWE) control on local maxima. We use simulations to contrast these procedures; both in terms of their relative number of discoveries and their spatial accuracy (via the distribution of the Euclidian distance between true and discovered activations). We also assessed two other procedures: cluster-wise and voxel-wise FOR procedures. Our results suggest that (a) FDR control of maxima or peaks is more sensitive than FWE control of peaks with minimal cost in terms of false-positives, (b) voxel-wise FDR is substantially less accurate than topological FWE or FDR control. Finally, we present an illustrative application using an fMRI study of visual attention. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we introduce a novel combination of functional and anatomical connectivity to study the network topology subserving a cognitive function of interest. (i) In a given network, direct interactions between network nodes are identified by analyzing functional MRI time series with the multivariate method of directed partial correlation (dPC). This method provides important improvements over shortcomings that are typical for ordinary (partial) correlation techniques. (ii) For directly interacting pairs of nodes, a region-to-region probabilistic fiber tracking on diffusion tensor imaging data is performed to identify the most probable anatomical white matter fiber tracts mediating the functional interactions. This combined approach is applied to the language domain to investigate the network topology of two levels of auditory comprehension: lower-level speech perception (i.e., phonological processing) and higher-level speech recognition (i.e., semantic processing). For both processing levels, dPC analyses revealed the functional network topology and identified central network nodes by the number of direct interactions with other nodes. Tractography showed that these interactions are mediated by distinct ventral (via the extreme capsule) and dorsal (via the arcuate/superior longitudinal fascicle fiber system) long- and short-distance association tracts as well as commissural fibers. Our findings demonstrate how both processing routines are segregated in the brain on a large-scale network level.

Neuronal activity in the human brain can be non-invasively imaged with magneto(MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), but the large-scale structure of synchronized cortical networks supporting cognitive processing has remained uncharacterized. We combined simultaneous MEG and EEG (MEEG) recordings with minimum-norm-estimate-based inverse modeling to investigate the structure of oscillatory phase synchronized networks that were active during visual working memory (VWM) maintenance. Inter-areal phase-synchrony was quantified as a function of time and frequency by single-trial phase-difference estimates of cortical patches covering the entire cortical surfaces. The resulting networks were characterized with a number of network metrics that were then compared between delta/theta- (3-6 Hz), alpha- (7-13 Hz), beta- (16-25 Hz), and gamma- (30-80 Hz) frequency bands. We found several salient differences between frequency bands. Alpha- and beta-band networks were more clustered and small-world like but had smaller global efficiency than the networks in the delta/theta and gamma bands. Alpha- and beta-band networks also had truncated-power-law degree distributions and high k-core numbers. The data converge on showing that during the VWM-retention period, human cortical alpha- and beta-band networks have a memory-load dependent, scale-free small-world structure with densely connected core-like structures.

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in this study to investigate the neural correlates of TOT effects in a group of 15 subjects as they performed a 20-min continuous psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). Subjects displayed significant TOT effects, as seen in progressively slower reaction times and significantly increased mental fatigue ratings after the task. Perfusion data showed that the PVT activates a right latelalized fronto-parietal attentional network in addition to the basal ganglia and sensorimotor cortices.

651,648,"Two distinct literatures have emerged on the functionality of the anterior temporal lobes (ATL): in one field, the ATLs are conceived of as a repository for semantic or conceptual knowledge. In another field, the ATLs are thought to play some undetermined role in social-emotional functions such as Theory of Mind. Here we attempted to reconcile these distinct functions by assessing whether social semantic processing can explain ATL activation in other social cognitive tasks. Social semantic functions refer to knowledge about social concepts and rules. In a first experiment we tested the idea that social semantic representations can account for activations in the ATL to social attribution stimuli such as Heider and Simmel animations. Left ATL activations to Heider and Simmel stimuli overlapped with activations to social words. In a second experiment we assessed the putative roles of the ATLs in the processing of narratives and theory of mind content and found evidence for a role of the ATLs in the processing of theory of mind but not narrative per se. These findings indicate that the ATLs are part of a neuronal network supporting social cognition and that they are engaged when tasks demand access to social conceptual knowledge.

652,649,"Background: Inhibitory dysfunction is a key behavioral and cognitive phenotype of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Both disorders show neuropsychological deficits and fronto-striatal dysfunction during tasks of motor response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. This study investigates differences and commonalities in functional neural networks mediating inhibitory control between adolescents with ADHD and those with OCD to identify disorder-specific neurofunctional markers that distinguish these two inhibitory disorders. Methods: Event-related fMRI was used to compare brain activation between 20 healthy boys, IS (Stop task) or 12 boys (Switch task) with ADHD, and 10 boys with OCD during a tracking Stop task that measures inhibition and stopping failure and during a visual-spatial switching task measuring cognitive flexibility. Results: Both patient groups shared brain dysfunction compared to healthy controls in right orbitofrontal (successful inhibition) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (failed inhibition). Right inferior prefrontal dysfunction, however, was disorder-specific to ADHD during both tasks. Left inferior prefrontal dysfunction during the Switch task was significant in children with ADHD relative to controls, but only reached a trend in patients with OCD. Patients with ADHD furthermore showed disorder-specific dysfunction in left basal ganglia and cingulate gyrus during the Switch task. Conclusions: Patients with ADHD compared to those with OCD have both common and distinct dysfunctions during inhibitory control. The most consistently reported functional abnormality in children with ADHD in right inferior prefrontal cortex during inhibitory control appears to be disorder-specific when compared to patients with OCD and may be a specific neurofunctional biomarker of ADHD.

654,651,"Supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly popular tools for fMRI decoding due to their predictive capability and their ability to capture information encoded by spatially correlated voxels. In addition, an important secondary Outcome is a multivariate representation of the pattern underlying the prediction Despite an impressive array of applications, most fMRI applications are framed as classification problems and predictions are limited to categorical class decisions For many applications, quantitative predictions are desirable that more accurately represent variability within subject groups and that can be correlated with behavioural variables. We evaluate the predictive capability of Gaussian process (GP) models for two types of quantitative prediction (multivariate regression and probabilistic classification) using whole-brain fMRI volumes. As a proof of concept, we apply GP models to an fMRI experiment investigating subjective responses to thermal pain and show GP models predict subjective pain ratings Without requiring anatomical hypotheses about functional localisation of relevant brain processes Even in the case of pain perception, where strong hypotheses do exist, GP predictions were more accurate than any region previously demonstrated to encode pain intensity We demonstrate two brain mapping methods suitable for GP models and we show that GP regression models outperform state of the art support vector- and relevance vector regression.

Twelve MDD participants and 12 never-depressed controls completed the negative affective priming (NAP) task in the scanner. Results indicated that, in depressed participants, increased activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is associated with inhibition of negative, but not positive, words; in contrast, in nondepressed participants, inhibition of positive, but not negative, words is associated with increased activation in the rACC. These findings indicate that abnormalities in neural function, especially in the rACC, may underlie difficulties experienced by depressed individuals in inhibiting negative thoughts.

To test the hypothesis that onset of cannabis use in early adolescence in male schizophrenia patients is associated with abnormalities in white matter structure and integrity, we used high resolution structural and diffusion tensor brain images to compare three groups of patients: those who started regular use of cannabis (1) before the age of 15 years (early-onset cannabis users, n = 10) or (2) at the age of 17 years or later (late-onset cannabis users, n = 8), and (3) those who were cannabis naive (n = 8). To verify patient findings, we also compared white matter integrity of the three patient groups with that of a healthy control group (n = 10). Cannabis naive patients showed reduced white matter density and reduced fractional anisotropy, an indicator for white matter integrity, in the splenium of the corpus callosum compared with patients with early-onset cannabis use. In the same brain area, cannabis naive patients showed reduced fractional anisotropy compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that the age of onset of cannabis use is not an identifying characteristic for white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia patients; however, our results might indicate a more vulnerable brain structure in cannabis naive schizophrenia patients.

The aim of this neuroimaging study was to investigate differences in BOLD-signal caused by administration of the SSRIs escitalopram and citalopram using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (pharmaco-fMRI). Eighteen healthy subjects participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study in cross-over repeated measures design. Each volunteer performed facial emotional discrimination and a sensorimotor control paradigm during three scanning sessions. Citalopram (20 mg/d), escitaloprarn (10 mg/d) and placebo were administered for 10 days each with a drug-free period of at least 21 days. Significant pharmacological effects on BOLD-signal were found in the amygdala, medial frontal gyrus, parahippocampal, fusiform and middle temporal gyri. Post-hoc t-tests revealed decreased BOLD-signal in the right amygdala and left parahippocampal gyrus in both pharmacological conditions, compared to placebo. Escitalopram, compared to citalopram, induced a decrease of BOLD-signal in the medial frontal gyrus and an increase in the right fusiform and left parahippocampal gyri. Drug effects were concentrated in brain regions with dense serotonergic projections. Both escitalopram and citalopram attenuated BOLD-signal in the amygdala and parahippocampal cortex to emotionally significant stimuli compared to control stimuli. We believe that reduced reactivity in the medial frontal gyrus found for escitalopram compared to citalopram administration might explain the response differences between Study drugs as demonstrated in previous clinical trials.

To assess sexual dimorphism, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied on structural magnetic resonance images of 34 healthy, young adult humans (17 women, 17 men, 26.6 +/- 5 years) using analyses of covariance. Subsequently, circulating levels of sex hormones were associated with regional GM using linear regression analyses. After adjustment for sex and total GM, significant associations of regional GM and 17 beta-estradiol were observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (beta=0.39, p = 0.02). Regional GM was inversely associated with testosterone in the left inferior frontal gyrus (beta=-0.16, p=0.04), and with progesterone in the right temporal pole (beta=-0.39, p=0.008).

Using the classical twin design, we assessed genetic, shared environmental, and individual-specific environmental influences on individual differences in the size of 96 brain regions of interest (ROIs). Participants were 474 middle-aged male twins (202 pairs; 70 unpaired) in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). They were 51-59 years old, and were similar to U.S. men in their age range in terms of sociodemographic and health characteristics. We measured thickness of cortical ROIs and volume of other ROIs. On average, genetic influences accounted for approximately 70% of the variance in the volume of global, subcortical, and ventricular ROIs and approximately 45% of the variance in the thickness of cortical ROIs. There was greater variability in the heritability of cortical ROIs (0.00-0.75) as compared with subcortical and ventricular ROIs (0.48-0.85). The results did not indicate lateralized heritability differences or greater genetic influences oil the size of regions underlying higher cognitive functions.

An advantage of this approach is that all segmented structures are topologically constrained, thereby allowing subsequent processing Such as cortical unfolding or diffeomorphic shape analysis techniques. Evaluation with both simulated and real data sets demonstrates that the method has an accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation methods, while simultaneously segmenting the whole brain.

670,667,"Neuroimaging (e.g. fMRI) data are increasingly used to attempt to identify not only brain regions of interest (ROIs) that are especially active during perception, cognition, and action, but also the qualitative causal relations among activity in these regions (known as effective connectivity; Friston, 1994). Previous investigations and anatomical and physiological knowledge may somewhat constrain the possible hypotheses, but there often remains a vast space of possible causal structures. To find actual effective connectivity relations, search methods must accommodate indirect measurements of nonlinear time series dependencies, feedback, multiple Subjects possibly varying in identified regions of interest, and unknown possible location-dependent variations in BOLD response delays. We describe combinations of procedures that under these conditions find feed-forward sub-structure characteristic of a group of subjects. The method is illustrated with an empirical data set and confirmed with simulations of time series of non-linear, randomly generated, effective connectivities, with feedback, subject to random differences of BOLD delays, with regions of interest missing at random for some subjects, measured with noise approximating the signal to noise ratio of the empirical data.

671,668,"Electrophysiological correlates of the processing facial expressions were investigated in Subjects performing the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. The peak latencies of the event-related potential (ERP) components P1, vertex positive potential (VPP), and N170 were 165, 240, and 240 ins, respectively. The early anterior N100 and posterior P1 amplitudes elicited by fearful faces were larger than those elicited by happy or neutral faces, a finding which is consistent with the presence of a 'negativity bias.' The amplitude of the anterior VPP was larger when subjects were processing fearful and happy faces than when they were processing neutral faces; it was similar in response to fearful and happy faces. The late N300 and P300 not only distinguished emotional faces from neutral faces but also differentiated between fearful and happy expressions in lag2. The amplitudes of the N100, VPP, N170, N300, and P300 components and the latency of the P1 component were modulated by attentional resources. Deficient attentional resources resulted in decreased amplitude and increased latency of ERP components. In light of these results, we present a hypothetical model involving three stages of facial expression processing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

673,670,"Successful working memory (WM) requires the engagement of relevant brain areas but possibly also the disengagement of irrelevant areas. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to elucidate the temporal dynamics of areas involved in a somatosensory WM task. We found an increase in gamma band activity in the primary and secondary somatosensory areas during encoding and retention, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase of alpha band activity over task-irrelevant regions including posterior and ipsilateral somatosensory cortex. Importantly, the alpha band increase was strongest during successful WM performance. Furthermore, we found frontal gamma band activity that correlated both with behavioral performance and the alpha band increase. We suggest that somatosensory gamma band activity reflects maintenance and attention-related components of WM operations, whereas alpha band activity reflects frontally controlled disengagement of task-irrelevant regions. Our results demonstrate that resource allocation involving the engagement of task-relevant and disengagement of task-irrelevant regions is needed for optimal task execution.

674,671,"The idea of an organized mode of brain function that is present as default state and suspended during goal-directed behaviors has recently gained Much interest in the study of human brain function. The default mode hypothesis is based. on the repeated observation that certain brain areas show task-induced deactivations across a wide range of cognitive tasks. In this event-related functional resonance imaging study we tested the default mode hypothesis by comparing common and selective patterns of BOLD deactivation in response to the demands on visual attention and working memory (WM) that were independently modulated within one task. The results revealed task-induced deactivations within regions of the default mode network (DMN) with a segregation of areas that were additively deactivated by an increase in the demands on both attention and WM, and areas that were selectively deactivated by either high attentional demand or WM load. Attention-selective deactivations appeared in the left ventrolateral and medial prefrontal cortex and the left lateral temporal cortex. Conversely, WM-selective deactivations were found predominantly in the right hemisphere including the medial-parietal, the lateral temporo-parietal, and the medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, during W-M encoding deactivated regions showed task-specific functional connectivity. These findings demonstrate that task-induced deactivations within parts of the DMN depend on the specific characteristics of the attention and WM components of the task. The DMN can thus be subdivided into a set of brain regions that deactivate indiscriminately in response to cognitive demand (""the core DMN"") and a part whose deactivation depends on the specific task.

Anterodorsal, centromedial, and pulvinar nuclei are the main sites of degeneration in AD. Here we combined shape analysis and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to study degeneration in AD in the thalamus and its connections. Structural and diffusion tensor MRI scans were obtained from 16 AD patients and 22 demographically similar healthy Volunteers. The thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala were automatically segmented using our locally developed algorithm, and group comparisons were carried out for each Surface vertex. We also employed Probabilistic diffusion tractography to obtain connectivity measures between individual thalamic voxels and hippocampus/amygdala voxels and to segment the internal medullary lamina (IML). Shape analysis showed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorsal-medial part of the thalamus in AD patients compared to controls. Probabilistic tractography demonstrated that these regions are mainly connected with the hippocampus, temporal, and prefrontal cortex. Intrathalamic FA comparisons showed reductions in the anterodorsal region of thalamus. Intrathalamic tractography from this region revealed that the IML was significantly smaller in AD patients than in controls. We suggest that these changes can be attributed to the degeneration of the anterodorsal and intralaminar nuclei, respectively. In addition, based on previous neuropathological reports, ventral and dorsal-medial shape change in the thalamus in AD patients is likely to be driven by IML atrophy.

676,673,"In the study of early brain development, tissue segmentation of neonatal brain MR images remains challenging because of the insufficient image quality due to the properties of developing tissues. Among Various brain tissue segmentation algorithms, atlas-based brain image segmentation can potentially achieve good segmentation results on neonatal brain images. However, their performances rely oil both the quality of the atlas and the spatial correspondence between the atlas and the to-be-segmented image. Moreover, it is difficult to build a population atlas for neonates due to the requirement of a large set of tissue-segmented neonatal brain images. To combat these obstacles, we present a longitudinal neonatal brain image segmentation framework by taking advantage of the longitudinal data acquired at late time-point to build a subject-specific tissue probabilistic atlas. Specifically, tissue segmentation of the neonatal brain is formulated as two iterative steps of bias correction and probabilistic-atlas-based tissue segmentation, along with the longitudinal atlas reconstructed by the late time image of the same subject. The proposed method has been evaluated qualitatively through Visual inspection and quantitatively by comparing with manual delineations and two population-atlas-based segmentation methods. Experimental results show that the utilization of a subject-specific probabilistic atlas can substantially improve tissue segmentation of neonatal brain images. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We find decreased correlations of these residuals (a decreased ""connectivity"") in ASD subjects. Furthermore, we find that this decrease was not due to task-related effects, block-to-block variations in task performance, or increased noise, and the difference was greatest when primarily rest periods are considered.

The protocol is demonstrated by imaging the hemodynamic response to median-nerve stimulation in three healthy subjects, and comparing the images obtained using a head atlas with the images obtained using the subject-specific head anatomy. The results indicate that using the head atlas anatomy it is possible to reconstruct the location of the brain activation to the expected gyrus of the brain, in agreement with the results obtained with the subject-specific head anatomy. The benefits of this novel method derive from eliminating the need for subject-specific head anatomy and thus obviating the need for a subject-specific MRI to improve the anatomical interpretation of diffuse optical tomography images of brain activation.

Baseline brain activity was altered by inducing anesthesia (sevoflurane end-tidal concentration 1%) in human volunteers and fc-fMRI maps between the pre-anesthetized and anesthetized conditions were compared across different brain networks. We particularly focused on low-level sensory areas (primary somatosensory, Visual, and auditory cortices), the thalamus, and pain (insula), memory (hippocampus) circuits, and the default mode network (DMN), the latter three to examine higher-order brain regions. The results indicate that, while fc-fMRI patterns did not significantly differ (p<0.005; 20-voxel cluster threshold) in sensory cortex and in the DMN between the pre- and anesthetized conditions, fc-fMRI in high-order cognitive regions (i.e. memory and pain circuits) was significantly altered by anesthesia. These findings provide further evidence that fc-fMRI reflects intrinsic brain properties, while also demonstrating that 0.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia preferentially modulates higher-order connections.

681,678,"Neuroticism is associated with the experience of negative affect and the development of affective disorders. While evidence exists for a modulatory role of neuroticism on task induced brain activity, it is unknown how neuroticism affects brain connectivity, especially the crucial coupling between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Here we investigate this relation between functional connectivity and personality in response to negative facial expressions. Sixty healthy control participants, from the Netherlands Study on Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), were scanned during an emotional faces gender decision task. Activity and functional amygdala connectivity (psycho-physiological interaction [PPI]) related to faces of negative emotional valence (angry, fearful and sad) was compared to neutral facial expressions, while neuroticism scores were entered as a regressor. Activity for fearful compared to neutral faces in the dorsomedial prefrontal (dmPFC) cortex was positively correlated with neuroticism scores. PPI analyses revealed that right amygdala-dmPFC connectivity for angry and fearful compared to neutral faces was positively correlated with neuroticism scores. In contrast, left amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) connectivity for angry, fearful and sad compared to neutral faces was negatively related to neuroticism levels. DmPFC activity has frequently been associated with self-referential processing in social cognitive tasks. Our results therefore suggest that high neurotic participants display stronger self-referential processing in response to negative emotional faces. Second, in line with previous reports on ACC function, the negative correlation between amygdala-ACC connectivity and neuroticism scores might indicate that those high in neuroticism display diminished control function of the ACC over the amygdala. These connectivity patterns might be associated with vulnerability to developing affective disorders such as depression and anxiety. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we addressed brain correlates of PPA in a detailed neuroanatomical analysis of the third canonical syndrome of PPA, logopenic/phonological aphasia (LPA), in relation to the more widely studied clinico-anatomical syndromes of semantic dementia (SD) and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). 32 PPA patients (9 SO, 14 PNFA, 9 LPA) and 18 cognitively normal controls had volumetric brain MRI with regional volumetry, cortical thickness, grey and white matter voxel-based morphometry analyses. Five of nine patients with LPA had cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers consistent with Alzheimer (AD) pathology (AD-PPA) and 2/9 patients had progranulin (GRN) Mutations (GRN-PPA). The LPA group had tissue loss in a widespread left hemisphere network. Compared with PNFA and SO, the LPA group had more extensive involvement of grey matter in posterior temporal and parietal cortices and long association white matter tracts. Overlapping but distinct networks were involved in the AD-PPA and GRN-PPA subgroups, with more anterior temporal lobe involvement in GRN-PPA. The importance of these findings is threefold: firstly, the clinico-anatomical entity of LPA has a profile of brain damage that is complementary to the network-based disorders of SD and PNFA; secondly, the core phonological processing deficit in LPA is likely to arise from temporo-parietal junction damage but disease spread occurs through the dorsal language network (and in GRN-PPA, also the ventral language network); and finally, GRN Mutations provide a specific molecular Substrate for language network dysfunction.

FMRI studies of verbal fluency, however, have used either silent word generation (which provides no behavioral measure) or cued generation of single words in order to contend with speech-related motion artifacts. In this study, we use a recently developed paradigm design to investigate the neural correlates of verbal fluency during overt, free recall, word generation so that performance and brain activity could be evaluated under conditions that more closely mirror standard behavioral test demands. We investigated verbal fluency to both letter and category cues in order to evaluate differential involvement of specific frontal and temporal lobe sites as a function of retrieval cue type, as suggested by previous neuropsychological and neuroimaging investigations. in addition, we incorporated both a task switching manipulation and an automatic speech condition in order to modulate the demand placed on executive functions. We found greater activation in the left hemisphere during category and letter fluency tasks, and greater right hemisphere activation during automatic speech. We also found that letter and category fluency tasks were associated with differential involvement of specific regions of the frontal and temporal lobes. These findings provide converging evidence that letter and category fluency performance is dependent on partially distinct neural circuitry. They also provide strong evidence that verbal fluency can be successfully evaluated in the MR environment using overt, self-paced, responses.

The high static and dynamic activities in the PCC, MPFC, insula/STG and thalamus suggest that these regions play a vital role in maintaining and facilitating fundamental brain functions.

685,682,"Greater loss in structural integrity of the ipsilesional corticospinal tract (CST) is associated with poorer motor Outcome in patients with hemiparetic stroke. Animal models of stroke have demonstrated that structural remodeling of white matter in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres is associated with improved motor recovery. Accordingly, motor recovery in patients with stroke may relate to the relative strength of CST degeneration and remodeling. This study examined the relationship between microstructural status of brain white matter tracts, indexed by the fractional anisotropy (FA) metric derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and motor skill of the stroke-affected hand in patients with chronic stroke. Voxelwise analysis revealed that motor skill significantly and positively correlated with FA of the ipsilesional and contralesional CST in the patients. Additional voxelwise analyses showed that patients with poorer motor skill had reduced FA of bilateral CST compared to normal control subjects, whereas patients with better motor skill had elevated FA of bilateral CST compared to controls. These findings were confirmed using a DTI-tractography method applied to the CST in both hemispheres. The results of this study suggest that the level of motor skill recovery achieved in patients with hemiparetic stroke relates to microstructural status of the CST in both the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, which may reflect the net effect of degeneration and remodeling of bilateral CST.

686,683,"Voxel-based analyses (VBA) are increasingly being used to detect white matter abnormalities with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in different types of pathologies. However, the validity, specificity, and sensitivity of statistical inferences of group differences to a large extent depend on die quality of die spatial normalization of the DTI images. Using high-dimensional nonrigid coregistration techniques that are able to align both the spatial and orientational diffusion information and incorporate appropriate templates that contain this complete DT information may improve this quality. Alternatively, a hybrid technique such as tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) may improve the reliability of the statistical results by generating voxel-wise statistics without the need for perfect image alignment and spatial smoothing. In this study, we have used (1) a coregistration algorithm that was optimized for coregistration of DTI data and (2) a population-based DTI atlas to reanalyze our previously published VBA, which compared the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with those of healthy controls. Additionally, we performed a complementary TBSS analysis to improve our understanding and interpretation of the VBA results. We demonstrate that, as the overall variance of the diffusion properties is lowered after normalizing the DTI data with such recently developed techniques (VBA using our own optimized high-dimensional nonrigid coregistration and TBSS), more reliable voxel-wise statistical results can be obtained than had previously been possible, with our VBA and TBSS yielding very similar results.

688,685,"The corpus callosum (CC) is the main commissure connecting the cerebral hemispheres Previous evidence suggests the involvement of the CC in the pathophysiology of autism. However, most studies examined the mid-sagittal area and investigations applying novel methods are warranted. The goal of this investigation is to apply a volumetric method to examine the size of the CC in autism and to identify any association with clinical features. An MRI-based morphometric study of the total CC volume and its seven subdivisions was conducted and involved 22 children with autism (age range 8.1-127 years) and 23 healthy, age-matched controls. Reductions in the total volume of the CC and several of its subdivisions were found in the autism sample. Associations were observed between CC structures and clinical features including social deficits, repetitive behaviors. and sensory abnormalities. Volumetric alterations of the CC observed in this investigation are consistent with midsagittal area tracings of decreased CC size in autism. These findings support the aberrant connectivity hypothesis with possible decrease in interhemispheric communications.

689,686,"Prior studies have focused on patterns of brain atrophy with aging and age-associated cognitive decline. It is possible that changes in neural tissue properties could provide an important marker of more subtle changes compared to gross morphometry. However, little is known about how MRI tissue parameters are altered in aging. We created cortical surface models of 148 individuals and mapped regional gray and white matter T1-weighted signal intensities from 3D MPRAGE images to examine patterns of age-associated signal alterations. Gray matter intensity was decreased with aging with strongest effects in medial frontal, anterior cingulate, and inferior temporal regions. White matter signal intensity decreased with aging in superior and medial frontal, cingulum, and medial and lateral temporal regions. The gray/white ratio (GWR) was altered throughout a large portion of the cortical mantle, with strong changes in superior and inferior frontal, lateral parietal, and superior temporal and precuneus regions demonstrating decreased overall contrast. Statistical effects of contrast changes were stronger than those of cortical thinning. These results demonstrate that there are strong regional changes in neural tissue properties with aging and tissue intensity measures may serve as an important biomarker of degeneration.

690,687,"The early detection of stimuli signalling threat to an organism is a crucial evolutionary advantage. For example, the perception of aversive bodily sensations such as dyspnea and pain strongly motivates fast adaptive behaviour to ensure survival. Their similarly threatening and motivating characters led to the speculation that both sensations are mediated by common brain areas, which has also been suggested by neuroimaging studies on either dyspnea or pain. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we formally tested this hypothesis and compared the cortical processing of perceived heat pain and resistive load induced dyspnea in the same group of participants. Here we show that the perception of both aversive sensations is processed in similar brain areas including the insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala and medial thalamus. These areas have a documented role in the processing of emotions such as fear and anxiety. Thus, the current study highlights the role of a common emotion-related human brain network which underlies the perception of aversive bodily sensations such as dyspnea and pain. This network seems crucial for translating the threatening character of different bodily signals into behavioural consequences that promote survival. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To assess potential neuroimaging biomarkers, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is following normal controls (NC) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. We applied high-throughput image analyses procedures to these data to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting subtle structural changes in prodromal AD. Raw DICOM scans (139 NC, 175 MCI, and 84 AD) were downloaded for analysis. Volumetric segmentation and cortical Surface reconstruction produced continuous cortical surface maps and region-of-interest (ROT) measures. The MCI cohort was subdivided into single- (SMCI) and multiple-domain MCI (MMCI) based on neuropsychological performance. Repeated measures analyses of covariance were used to examine group and hemispheric effects while controlling for age, sex, and, for volumetric measures, intracranial Vault. ROT analyses showed group differences for ventricular, temporal, posterior and rostral anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and frontal regions. SMCI and NC differed within temporal, rostral posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, precuneus, and caudal midfrontal regions. With MMCI and AD, greater differences were evident in these regions and additional frontal and retrosplenial cortices; evidence for non-AD pathology in MMCI also was suggested. Mesial temporal right-dominant asymmetries were evident and did not interact with diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that high-throughput methods provide numerous measures to detect Subtle effects of prodromal AD, suggesting early and later stages of the preclinical state in this cross-sectional sample.

695,692,"Developmental dyslexia has been associated with a dysfunction of a brain region in the left inferior occipitotemporal cortex, called the ""visual word-form area"" (VWFA). In adult normal readers, the VWFA is specialized for print processing and sensitive to the orthographic familiarity of letter strings. However, it is still unclear whether these two levels of occipitotemporal specialization are affected in developmental dyslexia. Specifically, we investigated whether (a) these two levels of specialization are impaired in dyslexic children with only a few years of reading experience and (b) whether this impairment is confined to the left inferior occipitotemporal VWFA, or extends to adjacent regions of the ""VWF-system"" with its posterior-anterior gradient of print specialization. Using fMRI, we measured brain activity in 18 dyslexic and 24 age-matched control children (age 9.7-12.5 years) while they indicated if visual stimuli (real words, pseudohomophones, pseudowords and false-fonts) sounded like a real word. Five adjacent regions of interest (ROIs) in the bilateral occipitotemporal cortex covered the full anterior-posterior extent of the VWF-system. We found that control and dyslexic children activated the same main areas within the reading network. However, a gradient of print specificity (higher anterior activity to letter strings but higher posterior activity to false-fonts) as well as a constant sensitivity to orthographic familiarity (higher activity for unfamiliar than familiar word-forms) along the VWF-system could only be detected in controls. In conclusion, analyzing responses and specialization profiles along the left VWF-system reveals that children with dyslexia show impaired specialization for both print and orthography.

We collected structural and functional magnetic resonance images (MRI) in children 8 to 12 years of age with high-functioning autism (n = 12) and typical development (n = 15). The functional MRI experiment involved matching facial expressions and people. Volumetric analysis of the amygdala was also performed. The results showed that children with autism exhibited intact emotion matching, while showing diminished activation of the fusiform gyrus (FG) and the amygdala. Conversely, the autism group showed deficits in person matching amidst some FG and variable amygdala activation. No significant between-group differences in the volume of the left or right amygdala were found. There were associations between age, social anxiety and amygdala volume in the children with autism such that smaller volumes were generally associated with more anxiety and younger age. In summary, the data are consistent with abnormalities in circuits involved in emotion and face processing reported in studies of older subjects with autism showing reductions in amygdala activation related to emotion processing and reduced fusiform activation involved in face processing.

Using cross-cultural functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined whether the Cultural values of individualism and collectivism modulate neural activity within medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during processing of general and contextual self judgments. Here, we show that neural activity within the anterior rostral portion of the MPFC during processing of general and contextual self judgments positively predicts how individualistic or collectivistic a person is across cultures.

699,696,"The present study investigated the premise that individual differences in autonomic physiology could be used to specify the nature and consequences of information processing taking place in medial prefrontal regions during cognitive reappraisal of unpleasant pictures. Neural (blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging) and autonomic (electrodermal [EDA], pupil diameter, cardiac acceleration) signals were recorded simultaneously as twenty-six older people (ages 64-66 years) used reappraisal to increase, maintain, or decrease their responses to unpleasant pictures. EDA was higher when increasing and lower when decreasing compared to maintaining. This Suggested modulation of emotional arousal by reappraisal. By contrast, pupil diameter and cardiac acceleration were higher when increasing and decreasing compared to maintaining. This suggested modulation of cognitive demand. Importantly, reappraisal-related activation (increase, decrease>rnaintain) in two medial prefrontal regions (dorsal medial frontal gyrus and dorsal cingulate gyrus) was correlated with greater cardiac acceleration (increase, decrease>maintain) and monotonic changes in EDA (increase>maintain>decrease). These data indicate that these two medial prefrontal regions are involved in the allocation of cognitive resources to regulate unpleasant emotion, and that they modulate emotional arousal in accordance with the regulatory goal. The emotional arousal effects were mediated by the right amygdala. Reappraisal-related activation in a third medial prefrontal region (subgenual anterior cingulate cortex) was not associated with similar patterns of change in any of the autonomic measures, thus highlighting regional specificity in the degree to which cognitive demand is reflected in medial prefrontal activation during reappraisal.

Here, we examined the effect of proinflammatory cytokine activation on the neural correlates of socially painful experience and associated depressed mood. Participants received either low-dose endotoxin or placebo through intravenous injection. Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6. were repeatedly assessed through hourly blood draws: self-reported depressed mood was assessed hourly as well, Two hours post-injection, participants completed a neuroimaging session in which they were socially excluded during an online ball-tossing game. Replicating previous research, individuals exposed to endotoxin, compared to placebo, showed increases in IL-6 levels and depressed mood. Although there were no meaningful differences between the endotoxin and control groups in neural responses to social exclusion, there were sex differences in the relationships between IL-6 increases and neural responses to exclusion among subjects exposed to endotoxin. Among females, but not males, exposed to endotoxin, increases in IL-6 were associated with increases in social pain-related neural activity (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula) that mediated the relationship between IL-6 increases and depressed mood increases. Implications of these sex differences in the neural correlates of cytokine-associated depressed mood and social pain are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, little is known about the time Course of these changes or the relationship of anatomical changes to perception and behaviour. In the present Study, We use a Fat model of neuropathic pain (spared nerve injury, SNI) and 7 T MRI to determine the longitudinal supraspinal changes associated with pain-like and anxiety-like behaviours. SNI rats and sham controls were scanned at seven time points, I week before surgery, 2 weeks after, and then once a month for 5 months. At each time point we performed behavioural tests, including thermal and mechanical sensitivity, and tests of locomotion and exploratory behaviour. (open field and elevated plus maze). We found that SNI rats had early and sustained thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, and developed anxiety-like behaviour's several months after injury. Compared to sham controls, SNI rats had decreased frontal cortex volumes several months after surgery, coincident with the onset of anxiety-like behaviours. There was also decreased Volume in retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices. We also explored areas that correlated with mechanical hyperalgesia and found that increased hyperalgesia was associated with decreased volumes in bilateral S1 hindlimb area, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, areas 32 and 24), and insula. Overall, Our results suggest that long-term neuropathic pain has widespread effects on brain anatomy related to the duration and Magnitude of the pain. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

702,699,"Brain mechanisms underlying hysterical conversion symptoms are still poorly known. Recent hypotheses Suggested that activation of motor pathways might be suppressed by inhibitory signals based on particular emotional Situations. To assess motor and inhibitory brain circuits during conversion paralysis, we designed a go-nogo task while a patient underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Preparatory activation arose in right motor cortex despite left paralysis, indicating preserved motor intentions, but with concomitant increases in vmPFC regions that normally mediate motivational and affective processing. Failure to execute movement on go trials with the affected left hand was associated with activations in precuneus and ventrolateral frontal gyrus. However, right frontal areas normally subserving inhibition were activated by nogo trials for the right (normal) hand, but not during go trials for the left hand (affected by conversion paralysis). By contrast, a group of healthy controls who were asked to feign paralysis showed similar activation on nogo trials and left-go trials with Simulated weakness, suggesting that distinct inhibitory mechanisms are implicated in Simulation and conversion paralysis. In the patient, right Motor cortex also showed enhanced functional connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and vmPFC. These results suggest that conversion symptoms do not act through cognitive inhibitory circuits, but involve selective activations in midline brain regions associated with self-related representations and emotion regulation.

703,700,"Controversy remains regarding the mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia. A prevailing theory, largely unproven in humans, is that it involves the activation of endogenous opioid antinociceptive systems and mu-opioid receptors (MORs). This is also a neurotransmitter system that mediates the effects of placebo-induced analgesia This Overlap in potential mechanisms may explain the lack of differentiation between traditional acupuncture and either non-traditional or sham acupuncture in multiple controlled clinical trials. We compared both short- and long-term effects of traditional Chinese acupuncture (TA) versus sham acupuncture (SA) treatment on in vivo MOR binding availability in chronic pain patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM). Patients were randomized to receive either TA or SA treatment over the course of 4 weeks. Positron emission tomography (PET) with C-11-carfentanil was performed once during the first treatment session and then repeated a month later following the eighth treatment. Acupuncture therapy evoked short-term increases in MOR binding potential, in Multiple pain and sensory processing regions including the cingulate (dorsal and subgenual). insula, caudate, thalamus, and amygdala. Acupuncture therapy also evoked long-term increases in MOR binding potential in some of the same structures including the cingulate (dorsal and perigenual), caudate, and amygdala. These short- and long-term effects were absent in the sham group where small reductions were observed, an effect more consistent with previous placebo PET studies. Long-term increases in MOR BP following TA were also associated with greater reductions in clinical pain. These findings Suggest that divergent MOR processes may mediate clinically relevant analgesic effects for acupuncture and sham acupuncture, (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, direct evidence of anatomical differences specific to white matter pathways underlying social behaviour and emotions in ASD is lacking. We used Diffusion Tensor Imaging Tractography to compare, in vivo, the microstructural integrity and age-related differences in the extended limbic pathways between subjects with Asperger syndrome and healthy controls. Twenty-four males with Asperger syndrome (mean age 23 12 years, age range: 9-54 years) and 42 age-matched male controls (mean age 25 10 years, age range: 9-54 years) were studied. We quantified tract-specific diffusivity measurements as indirect indexes of microstructural integrity (e.g. fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MID) and tract volume (e.g. number of streamlines) of the main limbic tracts. The dissected limbic pathways included the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, Uncinate, cingulum and fornix. There were no significant between-group differences in FA and MD. However, compared to healthy controls, individuals with Asperger syndrome had a significantly higher number Of streamlines in the right (p = .003) and left (p = .03) cingulum, and in the right (p = .03) and left (p = .04) inferior longitudinal fasciculus. In contrast, people with Asperger syndrome had a significantly lower number of streamlines in the right uncinate (p = .02). Within each group there were significant age-related differences in MD and number of streamlines, but not FA.

706,703,"Different brain structures accumulate iron at different rates throughout the adult life span. Typically, striatal and brain stem Structures are higher in iron concentrations in older than younger adults, whereas cortical white matter and thalamus have lower concentrations in the elderly than young adults. Brain iron can be measured in vivo with MRI by estimating the relaxivity increase across magnetic field strengths, which yields the Field-Dependent Relaxation Rate Increase (FDRI) metric. The influence of local iron deposition oil susceptibility, manifests as MR phase effects, forms the basis for another approach for iron measurement, Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI), for which imaging at only one field strength is sufficient. Here, we compared the ability of these two methods to detect and quantify brain iron in 11 Young (5 men, 6 women: 21 to 29 years) and 12 elderly (6 men, 6 women; 64 to 86 years) healthy adults. FDRI was acquired at 1.5 T and 3.0 T, and SWI was acquired at 1.5 T. The results showed that both methods detected high globus pallidus iron concentration regardless of age and significantly greater iron in putamen with advancing age. The SWI measures were more sensitive when the phase signal intensities themselves were used to define regions of interest, whereas FDRI measures were robust to the method of region of interest selection. Further, FDRI measures were more highly correlated than SWI iron estimates with published postmortem values and were more sensitive than SWI to iron concentration differences across basal ganglia structures. Whereas FDRI requires more imaging time than SWI, two field strengths, and across-study image registration for iron concentration calculation, FDRI appears more specific to age-dependent accumulation of non-heme brain iron than SWI, which is affected by heme iron and non-iron source effects on phase.

707,704,"Quantitative brain tissue segmentation from newborn MRI offers the possibility of improved clinical decision making and diagnosis, new insight into the mechanisms of disease, and new methods for the evaluation of treatment protocols for preterm newborns. Such segmentation is challenging, however, due to the imaging characteristics of the developing brain. Existing techniques for newborn segmentation either achieve automation by ignoring critical distinctions between different tissue types or require extensive expert interaction. Because manual interaction is time consuming and introduces both bias and variability, we have developed a novel automatic segmentation algorithm for brain MRI of newborn infants. The key algorithmic contribution of this work is a new approach for automatically learning patient-specific class-conditional probability density functions. The algorithm achieves performance comparable to expert segmentations while automatically identifying cortical gray matter, subcortical gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid, myelinated white matter and unmyelinated white matter. We compared the performance of our algorithm with a previously published semi-automated algorithm and with expert-drawn images. Our algorithm achieved an accuracy comparable with methods that require undesirable manual interaction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

708,705,"The structural and functional organization of the human cingulate cortex is an ongoing focus; however, human imaging studies continue to use the century-old Brodmann concept of a two region Cingulate cortex. Recently, a four-region neurobiological model was proposed based oil structural, circuitry, and functional imaging observations. It encompasses the anterior cingulate, midcingulate, posterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices (ACC, MCC, PCC, and RSC, respectively). For the first time, this Study performs multireceptor autoradiography of 15 neurotransmitter receptor ligands and multivariate statistics on human whole brain postmortem samples covering the entire cingulate cortex. We evaluated the validity of Brodmann's duality concept and of the four-region model using a hierarchical clustering analysis of receptor binding according to the degree of similarity of each area's receptor architecture. We could not find Support for Brodmann's dual cingulate concept, because the anterior part of his area 24 has significantly higher AMPA, kainate, GABA(B), benzodiazepine, and M-3 but lower NMDA and GABA(A) binding site densities than the posterior part. The hierarchical clustering analysis distinguished ACC, MCC, PCC, and RSC as independent regions. The ACC has highest AMPA, kainate, alpha(2), 5-HT1A, and D-1 but lowest GABA(A) densities. The MCC has lowest AMPA, kainate, alpha(2), and D-1 densities. Area 25 in ACC is similar in receptor-architecture to MCC, particularly the NMDA, GABA(A), GABA(B), and M-2 receptors. The PCC and RSC differ in the higher M-1 and alpha(1) but lower M-3 densities of PCC. Thus, multireceptor autoradiography Supports the four-region neurobiological model of the cingulate cortex.

Here, we test the hypothesis that the anterior insula/medial frontal operculum (aI/fO) provides linkage across systems supporting task demands and attention systems by examining the patterns of functional connectivity during word recognition and spatial attention functional imaging tasks. A shared set of frontal regions (right aI/fO, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate) were engaged, regardless of perceptual domain (auditory or visual) or mode of response (word production or button press). We present novel evidence that: (1) the right aI/fO is functionally connected with other frontal regions implicated in executive function and not just brain regions responsive to stimulus salience; and (2) that the aI/fO, but not the ACC, exhibits significantly correlated activity with other brain regions specifically engaged by tasks with varying perceptual and behavioral demands.

Although subcortical-cortical midline structures have been associated with reflection and introspection of oneself in healthy subjects, the neural correlates of the abnormally increased attribution Of negative emotions to oneself, i.e. negative self-attribution, as hallmark of the increased self-focus in MDD remain unclear. The aim of the study was, therefore, to investigate the neural correlates during judgment of self-related ness of positive and negative emotional stimuli thereby testing for emotional self-attribution. Using fMRI, we investigated 27 acute MDD patients and compared them with 25 healthy subjects employing a paradigm that focused oil judgment of self-relatedness when compared with mere perception of the very higher degrees of self-emotional stimuli. Behaviourally, patients with MDD showed significantly relatedness of specifically negative emotional stimuli when compared with healthy subjects. Neurally patients with MDD showed significantly lower signal intensities in Various subcortical and cortical midline regions like the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), supragenual anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, ventral striatum (VS), and the dorsomedial thalamus (DMT). Signal changes in the DMPFC correlated with depression severity and hopelessness whereas those in the VS and the DMT were related to judgment of self-relatedness of negative emotional stimuli. In conclusion, We present first evidence that the abnormally increased negative self-attribution as hallmark of the increased self-focus in MDD might be mediated by altered neural activity in subcortical-cortical midline structures.

712,709,"Objectives: Recent military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the wartime effect of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The reason for the prominence of TBI in these particular conflicts as opposed to others is unclear but may result from the increased survivability of blast due to improvements in body armor. In the military context blunt, ballistic and blast effects may all contribute to CNS injury, however blast in Particular, has been suggested as a primary cause of military TBI. While blast effects on some biological tissues, such as the lung, are documented in terms of injury thresholds, this is not the case for the CNS. We hypothesized that using bio-fidelic models, allowing for fluid-solid interaction and basic material properties available in the literature, a blast wave would interact with CNS tissue and cause a possible concussive effect. Methods: The modeling approach employed for this investigation consisted of a computational framework suitable for simulating coupled fluid-solid dynamic interactions. The model included a complex finite element mesh of the head and intra-cranial contents. The effects of threshold and 50% lethal blast lung injury were compared with concussive impact injury using the full head model allowing upper and lower bounds of tissue injury to be applied using pulmonary injury as the reference tissue. Results: The effects of a 50% lethal dose blast lung injury (LD50) were Comparable with concussive impact injury using the DVBIC-MIT full head model. Interpretation: CNS blast concussive effects were found to be similar between impact mild TBI and the blast field associated with LD50 lung blast injury sustained without personal protective equipment. With the ubiquitous use of personal protective equipment this suggests that blast concussive effects may more readily ascertained in personnel due to enhanced survivability in the current conflicts.

713,710,"Although Huntington's disease is largely considered to be a subcortical disease, there is no clear consensus on whether all deep grey matter loss is a direct downstream consequence of the massive degeneration of the medium-size spiny neurons in the striatum. Our aim was to characterise in vivo such preferential degeneration by analysing various distinct diffusion imaging measures including mean diffusivity, anisotropy, fibre orientation (using the information of the principal diffusion direction) and white matter tractography. All results converged to demonstrate the selective degeneration of connections in subcortical grey and white matter, degeneration which was likely to originate with the death of the striatal medium-size spiny neurons. Indeed, we found a significant increase of MD and FA in all the subcortical grey matter structures involved in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. The atypical striatal and pallidal increase of FA was concurrent to a decrease of the dispersion of the fibre orientation, unambiguously characterising a preferential loss of connections along specific radiating directions from these structures while some others are comparatively spared. Analysis of striatal and pallidal white matter tracts revealed that striato-pallidal projections were the most affected. The ability of DTI to uncover the impact of such neurodegenerative disease on some specific neuronal/axonal populations is a further step towards the future definition of a surrogate marker of this disease. Beyond Huntington's disease, we prove here that diffusion imaging technique, associated to adequate methodological analyses, can provide insight into any neurodegenerative disorder for which some neuronal populations or connections are selectively targeted over others.

We performed pairwise comparisons in each region of interest between patients and controls. MCI patients showed diffusion tensor change (DTC) in the left anterior periventricular (PV) area, possibly in the right posterior PV area, and the genu of the corpus callosum. AD patients showed DTC in the corpus callosum, and in frontal and parieto-occipital subcortical and anterior PV areas. In SIVD patients, DTC occurred in the genu of the corpus callosum, and in bilateral frontal subcortical and PV areas. FTD patients differed from controls in showing DTC in the temporal and frontal subcortical areas, the genu of the corpus callosum and PV areas. The degree of DTC correlated with the clinical severity of dementia as assessed by the clinical dementia rating (CDR). Mean diffusivity was diffusely and positively associated with the CDR scores. Fractional anisotropy of the PV areas was negatively associated with the CDR scores, suggesting a critical role of the lateral cholinergic pathways. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

715,712,"Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies indicated microstructural disruption of white matter in alcohol dependence. To investigate the microstructure of primary neurocircuitry involved in alcohol use disorders, the present study used Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) of DTI measures as well as probabilistic tractography. Eleven recovering alcoholics in their first week of abstinence from alcohol were compared with 10 light-drinking controls; diffusion measures were correlated with measures of neurocognition and drinking severity. Regions characterized by low fractional anisotropy and high mean diffusivity included cortico-striatal fibers and those in frontal white matter and limbic pathways. Greater diffusion abnormalities in sections of commissural fibers (inter-hemispheric connections) were associated with greater drinking severity, and lower fractional anisotropy measures in frontal and limbic fiber tracts correlated with lower visuospatial memory performance. These study findings provide direct evidence of compromised integrity of the motivational brain circuitry in alcohol use disorders. These abnormalities in fiber connections could be partially responsible for deficiencies in executive functions, behavioral regulation, and impulse control commonly described in alcohol dependence.

716,713,"Although there is ample evidence that motor imagery activates similar cerebral regions to those solicited during actual movements, it is still unknown whether visual (VI) and kinesthetic imagery (KI) recruit comparable or distinct neural networks. The present study was thus designed to identify, through functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0 Tesla in 13 skilled imagers, the cerebral structures implicated in VI and KI. Participants were scanned in a perceptual control condition and while physically executing or focusing during motor imagery on either the visual or kinesthetic components of an explicitly known sequence of finger movements. Subjects' imagery abilities were assessed using well-established psychological, chronometric, and new physiological measures from the autonomic nervous system. Compared with the perceptual condition, physical executing, VI, and KI resulted in overlapping (albeit non-identical) brain activations, including motor-related regions and the inferior and superior parietal lobules. By contrast, a divergent pattern of increased activity was observed when VI and KI were compared directly: VI activated predominantly the occipital regions and the superior parietal lobules, whereas KI yielded more activity in motor-associated structures and the inferior parietal lobule. These results suggest that VI and KI are mediated through separate neural systems, which contribute differently during processes of motor learning and neurological rehabilitation.

717,714,"Puberty represents the phase of sexual maturity, signaling the change from childhood into adulthood. During childhood and adolescence, prominent changes take place in the brain. Recently, variation in frontal, temporal, and parietal areas was found to be under varying genetic control between 5 and 19 years of age. However, at the onset of puberty, the extent to which variation in brain structures is influenced by genetic factors (heritability) is not known. Moreover, whether a direct link between human pubertal development and brain structure exists has not been studied. Here, we studied the heritability of brain structures at 9 years of age in 107 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (N = 210 individuals) using volumetric MRI and voxel-based morphometry. Children showing the first signs of secondary sexual characteristics (N = 47 individuals) were compared with children without these signs, based on Tanner-stages. High heritabilities of intracranial, total brain, cerebellum, and gray and white matter volumes (up to 91%) were found. Regionally, the posterior fronto-occipital, corpus callosum, and superior longitudinal fascicles (up to 93%), and the amygdala, superior frontal and middle temporal cortices (up to 83%) were significantly heritable. The onset of secondary sexual characteristics of puberty was associated with decreased frontal and parietal gray matter densities. Thus, in 9-year-old children, global brain volumes, white matter density in fronto-occipital and superior longitudinal fascicles, and gray matter density of (pre-)frontal and temporal areas are highly heritable. Pubertal development may be directly involved in the decreases in gray matter areas that accompany the transition of our brains from childhood into adulthood. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2184-2196, 2009.

719,716,"Previous Studies on working memory (WM) function in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggested aberrant activation of the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Although it has been hypothesized that activation differences in these regions most likely reflect aberrant frontocerebellar circuits, the functional coupling of these brain networks during cognitive performance has not been investigated so far. In this Study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and both univariate and multivariate analytic techniques were used to investigate regional activation changes and functional connectivity differences during cognitive processing in healthy controls (n = 12) and ADHD adults (n = 12). Behavioral performance during a parametric verbal WM paradigm did not significantly differ between adults with ADHD and healthy controls. During the delay period of the activation task, however, ADHD patients showed significantly less activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), as well as in cerebellar and occipital regions compared with healthy control subjects. In both groups, independent component analyses revealed a functional network comprising bilateral lateral prefrontal, striatal, and cingulate regions. ADHD adults had significantly lower connectivity in the bilateral VLPFC, the anterior cingulate cortex, the superior parietal lobule, and the cerebellum compared with healthy controls. Increased connectivity in ADHD adults was found in right prefrontal regions, the left dorsal cingulate cortex and the left cuneus. These findings suggest both regional brain activation deficits and functional connectivity changes of the VLPFC and the cerebellum as well as functional connectivity abnormalities of the anterior cingulate and the parietal cortex in ADHD adults during WM processing.

720,717,"With the advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the study of plastic changes in white matter architecture due to long-term practice has attracted increasing interest. Professional musicians provide an ideal model for investigating white matter plasticity because of their early onset of extensive auditory and sensorimotor training. We performed fiber tractography and subsequent voxelwise analysis, region of interest (ROI) analysis. and detailed slicewise analysis of diffusion parameters in the corticospinal tract (CST) on 26 professional musicians and a control group of 13 participants. All analyses resulted in significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in both the left and the right CST in the musician group. Furthermore, a right-greater-than-left asymmetry of FA was observed regardless of group. In the musician group, diffusivity was negatively correlated with the onset of musical training in childhood. A subsequent median split into an early and a late onset musician group (median = 7 years) revealed increased diffusivity in the CST of the early onset group as compared to both the late onset group and the controls. In conclusion, these DTI-based findings might indicate plastic changes in white matter architecture of the CST in professional musicians. Our results imply that training-induced changes in diffusion characteristics of the axonal membrane may lead to increased radial diffusivity as reflected in decreased FA values.

721,718,"The segmentation from MRI of macroscopically ill-defined and highly variable structures, such as the hippocampus (Hc) and the amygdala (Am), requires the use of specific constraints. Here, we describe and evaluate a fast fully automatic hybrid segmentation that uses knowledge derived from probabilistic atlases and anatomical landmarks, adapted from a semi-automatic method. The algorithm was designed at the outset for application on images from healthy subjects and patients with hippocampal sclerosis. Probabilistic atlases were built from 16 healthy subjects, registered using SPM5. Local mismatch in the atlas registration step was automatically detected and corrected. Quantitative evaluation with respect to manual segmentations was performed on the 16 Young subjects, with a leave-one-out strategy, a mixed cohort of 8 controls and 15 patients with epilepsy with variable degrees of hippocampal sclerosis, and 8 healthy subjects acquired on a 3 T scanner. Seven performance indices were computed, among which error on volumes RV and Dice overlap K. The method proved to be fast, robust and accurate. For Hc, results With the new method were: 16 Young subjects {RV = 5%, K = 87%}; mixed cohort {RV = 8%, K = 84%}; 3 T cohort {RV = 9%, K = 85%}. Results were better than with atlas-based (thresholded probability map) or semi-automatic segmentations. Atlas mismatch detection and correction proved efficient for the most sclerotic Hc. For Am, results were: 16 young controls {RV = 7%, K = 85%}; mixed cohort {RV = 19%, K = 78%}; 3 T cohort {RV = 10%, K = 77%}.

We present results on a study of brain morphology in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and midline structures, via indices of gray matter volume and density, in pediatric PTSD. We hypothesized that both methods would demonstrate aberrant morphology in the PFC. Further, we hypothesized aberrant brainstem anatomy and reduced corpus callosum volume in children with PTSD. Twenty-four children (aged 7-14) with history of interpersonal trauma and 24 age- and gender-matched controls underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). Images of the PFC and midline brain structures were first analyzed using volumetric image analysis. The PFC data were then compared with whole brain voxel-based techniques using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The PTSD group showed. significantly increased gray matter volume in the right and left inferior and superior quadrants of the PFC and smaller gray matter volume in the pons and posterior vermis areas by volumetric image analysis. The voxel-by-voxel group comparisons demonstrated increased gray matter density mostly localized to ventral PFC as compared with the control group. Abnormal frontal lobe morphology, as revealed by separate-complementary image analysis methods, and reduced pons and posterior vermis areas are associated with pediatric PTSD. Voxel-based morphometry may help to corroborate and further localize data obtained by volume of interest methods in PTSD. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

723,720,"Do certain brain states predispose humans to commit errors in monotonous tasks? We used MEG to investigate how oscillatory brain activity indexes the brain state in subjects performing a Go-noGo task. Elevated occipital alpha and sensorimotor MU activity just prior to the presentation of the stimuli predicted an upcoming error. An error resulted in increased frontal theta activity and decreased posterior alpha activity. This theta increase and alpha decrease correlated on a trial-by-trial basis reflecting post-error functional connectivity between the frontal and occipital regions. By examining the state of the brain before a stimulus, we were able to show that it is possible to predict lapses of attention before they actually occur. This supports the case that the state of the brain is important for how incoming stimuli are processed and for how subjects respond. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1791-1800, 2009.

724,721,"Recent studies at high magnetic fields using the phase of gradient-echo MR images have shown the ability to unveil cortical substructure in the human brain. To investigate the contrast mechanisms in phase imaging, this study extends, for the first time, phase imaging to the rodent brain. Using a 14.1 T horizontal bore animal MRI scanner for in vivo micro-imaging, images with an in-plane resolution of 33 mu m were acquired. Phase images revealed, often more clearly than the corresponding magnitude images, hippocampal fields, cortical layers (e. g. layer 4), cerebellar layers (molecular and granule cell layers) and small white matter structures present in the striatum and septal nucleus. The contrast of the phase images depended in part on the orientation of anatomical structures relative to the magnetic field, consistent with bulk susceptibility variations between tissues. This was found not only for vessels, but also for white matter structures, such as the anterior commissure, and cortical layers in the cerebellum. Such susceptibility changes could result from variable blood volume. However, when the deoxyhemoglobin content was reduced by increasing cerebral blood flow (CBF) with a carbogen breathing challenge, contrast between white and gray matter and cortical layers was not affected, suggesting that tissue cerebral blood volume (and therefore deoxyhemoglobin) is not a major source of the tissue phase contrast. We conclude that phase variations in gradient-echo images are likely due to susceptibility shifts of non-vascular origin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

FNC may help explain the complex relationships between distributed cerebral sites in the brain and possibly provide new understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. In this paper, we use independent component analysis (ICA) to extract the time courses of spatially independent components and then use these in Granger causality test (GCT) to investigate causal relationships between brain activation networks. We present results using both simulations and fMRI data of 155 subjects obtained during two different tasks. Unlike previous research, causal relationships are presented over different portions of the frequency spectrum in order to differentiate high and low-frequency effects and not merged in a scalar. The results obtained using Sternberg item recognition paradigm (SIRP) and auditory oddball (AOD) tasks showed FNC differentiations between schizophrenia and control groups, and explained how the two groups differed during these tasks. During the SIRP task, secondary visual and cerebellum activation networks served as hubs and included most complex relationships between the activated regions. Secondary visual and temporal lobe activations replaced these components during the AOD task. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

726,723,"At high magnetic field, MR images exhibit large, undesirable signal intensity variations commonly referred to as ""intensity field bias"". Such inhomogeneities mostly originate from heterogeneous RF coil B-1 profiles and, with no appropriate correction, are further pronounced when utilizing rooted sum of square reconstruction with receive coil arrays. These artifacts can significantly alter whole brain high resolution T-1-weighted (T(1)w) images that are extensively utilized for clinical diagnosis, for gray/white matter segmentation as well as for coregistration with functional time series. In T-1 weighted 3D-MPRAGE sequences, it is possible to preserve a bulk amount of T1 contrast through space by using adiabatic inversion RF pulses that are insensitive to transmit B1 variations above a minimum threshold. However, large intensity variations persist in the images, which are significantly more difficult to address at very high. eld where RF coil B1 profiles become more heterogeneous. Another characteristic of T1w MPRAGE sequences is their intrinsic sensitivity to Proton Density and T-2* contrast, which cannot be removed with post-processing algorithms utilized to correct for receive coil sensitivity. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple technique capable of producing normalized, high resolution T(1)w 3D-MPRAGE images that are devoid of receive coil sensitivity, Proton Density and T2. contrast. These images, which are suitable for routinely obtaining whole brain tissue segmentation at 7 T, provide higher T1 contrast specificity than standard MPRAGE acquisitions. Our results show that removing the Proton Density component can help in identifying small brain structures and that T2. induced artifacts can be removed from the images. The resulting unbiased T1w images can also be used to generate Maximum Intensity Projection angiograms, without additional data acquisition, that are inherently registered with T1w structural images. In addition, we introduce a simple technique to reduce residual signal intensity variations induced by transmit B1 heterogeneity. Because this approach requires two 3D images, one divided with the other, head motion could create serious problems, especially at high spatial resolution. To alleviate such inter-scan motion problems, we developed a new sequence where the two contrast acquisitions are interleaved within a single scan. This interleaved approach however comes with greater risk of intra-scan motion issues because of a longer single scan time. Users can choose between these two trade offs depending on specific protocols and patient populations. We believe that the simplicity and the robustness of this double contrast based approach to address intensity. eld bias at high. eld and improve T1 contrast specificity, together with the capability of simultaneously obtaining angiography maps, advantageously counter balance the potential drawbacks of the technique, mainly a longer acquisition time and a moderate reduction in signal to noise ratio.

Nothing is known yet regarding the neural underpinnings of unconditional love. The main goal of this functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to identify the brain regions supporting this form of love. Participants were scanned during a control condition and an experimental condition. In the control condition, participants were instructed to simply look at a series of pictures depicting individuals with intellectual disabilities. In the experimental condition, participants were instructed to feel unconditional love towards the individuals depicted in a series of similar pictures.

In the present study, we used fMRI-neurofeedback to train subjects to enhance regional activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to influence speech processing and to modulate language-related performance. Seven subjects underwent real-time fMRI-neurofeedback training and succeeded in achieving voluntary regulation of their right Brodmann's area (BA) 45. To examine short-term behavioral impact, two linguistic tasks were carried out immediately before and after the training. A significant improvement of accuracy was observed for the identification of emotional prosodic intonations but not for syntactic processing.

733,730,"Functional localizers that contrast brain signal when viewing faces versus objects are commonly used in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of face processing. However, current protocols do not reliably show all regions of the core system for face processing in all subjects when conservative statistical thresholds are used, which is problematic in the study of single subjects. Furthermore, arbitrary variations in the applied thresholds are associated with inconsistent estimates of the size of face-selective regions-of-interest (ROIs). We hypothesized that the use of more natural dynamic facial images in localizers might increase the likelihood of identifying face-selective ROIs in individual subjects, and we also investigated the use of a method to derive the statistically optimal ROI cluster size independent of thresholds. We found that dynamic facial stimuli were more effective than static stimuli, identifying 98% (versus 72% for static) of ROIs in the core face processing system and 69% (versus 39% for static) of ROIs in the extended face processing system. We then determined for each core face processing ROI, the cluster size associated with maximum statistical face-selectivity, which on average was approximately 50 mm(3) for the fusiform face area, the occipital face area, and the posterior superior temporal sulcus. We suggest that the combination of (a) more robust face-related activity induced by a dynamic face localizer and (b) a cluster-size determination based on maximum face-selectivity increases both the sensitivity and the specificity of the characterization of face-related ROIs in individual subjects.

734,731,"Information processing models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suggest that PTSD is characterized by preferential allocation of attentional resources to potentially threatening stimuli. However, few studies have examined the neural pattern underlying attention and emotion in association with PTSD symptomatology. In the present study, combat veterans with PTSD symptomatology engaged in an emotional oddball task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Veterans were classified into a high or low symptomatology group based on their scores on the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS). Participants discriminated infrequent target stimuli (circles) from frequent standards (squares) while emotional and neutral distractors were presented infrequently and irregularly. Results revealed that participants with greater PTSD symptomatology showed enhanced neural activity in ventral-limbic and dorsal regions for emotional stimuli and attenuated activity in dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal regions for attention targets. In the anterior cingulate gyrus, participants with fewer PTSD symptoms showed equivalent responses to attentional and emotional stimuli while the high symptom group showed greater activation for negative emotional stimuli. Taken together, the results suggest that hyperresponsive ventral-limbic activity coupled with altered dorsal-attention and anterior cingulate function may be a neural marker of attention bias in PTSD.

735,732,"Cerebellar histopathological abnormalities have been well documented in autism, although findings of structural differences, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, have been less consistent. This report explores specific cerebellar vermal structures and their relation with severity of symptoms and cognitive functioning in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children with ASD aged 3 to 4 years were compared with typically developing children (TD) matched to the ASD children on chronological age, and children with developmental delay (DD) matched to the ASD children on both chronological and mental age. Volumes of the cerebellum and midsagittal vermal areas were measured from 3-D T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Children with ASD had reduced total vermis volumes compared with children with TD after controlling for age, sex, and overall cerebral volume or cerebellum volume. In particular, the vermis lobe VI-VII area was reduced in children ASD compared with TD children. Children with DD had smaller total vermis areas compared with children with ASD and TD. Within the ASD group, cerebellar measurements were not correlated with symptom severity, or verbal, non-verbal or full scale IQ. Within the DD group, larger cerebellar measurements were correlated with fewer impairments. The specific relation between altered cerebellar structure and symptom expression in autism remains unclear. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

736,733,"With the rapid growth of neuroimaging research and accumulation of neuroinformatic databases the synthesis of consensus findings using meta-analysis is becoming increasingly important. Meta-analyses pool data across many studies to identify reliable experimental effects and characterize the degree of agreement across studies. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) methods are the standard approach, where each study entered into the meta-analysis has been summarized using only the (x, y, z) locations of peak activations (with or without activation magnitude) reported in published reports. Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) methods use the full statistic images, and allow the use of hierarchical mixed effects models that account for differing intra-study variance and modeling of random inter-study variation. The purpose of this work is to compare image-based and coordinate-based meta-analysis methods applied to the same dataset, a group of 15 fMRI studies of pain, and to quantify the information lost by working only with the coordinates of peak activations instead of the full statistic images. We apply a 3-level IBMA mixed model for a ""mega-analysis"", and highlight important considerations in the specification of each model and contrast. We compare the IBMA result to three CBMA methods: ALE (activation likelihood estimation), KDA (kernel density analysis) and MKDA (multi-level kernel density analysis), for various CBMA smoothing parameters. For the datasets considered, we find that ALE at sigma=15 mm, KDA at rho=25-30 mm and MKDA at rho=15 mm give the greatest similarity to the IBMA result, and that ALE was the most similar for this particular dataset, though only with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.45 (Dice measure ranges from 0 to 1). Based on this poor similarity, and the greater modeling flexibility afforded by hierarchical mixed models, we suggest that IBMA is preferred over CBMA. To make IBMA analyses practical, however, the neuroimaging field needs to develop an effective mechanism for sharing image data, including whole-brain images of both effect estimates and their standard errors.

737,734,"We introduce an automatic method that we call tract-based morphometry, or TBM, for measurement and analysis of diffusion MRI data along white matter fiber tracts. Using subject-specific tractography bundle segmentations, we generate an arc length parameterization of the bundle with point correspondences across all fibers and all subjects, allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this paper we present a quantitative comparison of fiber coordinate systems from the literature and we introduce an improved optimal match method that reduces spatial distortion and improves intra-and inter-subject variability of FA measurements. We propose a method for generating arc length correspondences across hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of interhemispheric diffusion asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and cingulum bundle (CB). The results of this study demonstrate that TBM can detect differences that may not be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD) differences found in AF. We report TBM results of higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower lambda(3), the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left AF), and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related to higher lambda(1), the largest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left CB). By mapping the significance levels onto the tractography trajectories for each structure, we demonstrate the anatomical locations of the interhemispheric differences.

739,736,"Impulsivity is a personality trait exhibited by healthy individuals, but excessive impulsivity is associated with some mental disorders. Lesion and functional, neuroimaging Studies indicate that the ventromedial prefrontal region (VMPFC), including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala may modulate impulsivity and aggression. However, no morphometric study has examined the association between VMPFC and impulsivity. We hypothesized that healthy subjects with high impulsivity would have smaller volumes in these brain regions compared with those with low impulsivity. Sixty-two healthy Subjects were Studied (age 35.4 +/- 12.1 years) using a 1.5-T MRI system. The Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS) was used to assess impulsivity. Images were processed using an optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) protocol. We calculated the correlations between BIS scale scores and the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes of VMPFC and amygdala. GM volumes of the left and right OFC were inversely correlated with the BIS total score (P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). Left ACC GM Volumes had a tendency to be inversely correlated with the BIS total score (P = 0.05. Right OFC GM Volumes were inversely correlated with BIS nonplanning impulsivity, and left OFC GM volumes were inversely correlated with motor impulsivity. There were no significant WM volume correlations with impulsivity. The results Of this morphometry Study indicate that small OFC volume relate to high impulsivity and extend the prior finding that the VMPFC is involved in the circuit modulating impulsivity.

We analyze the accuracy of gray and white matter Volume measurements and their robustness against changes of image quality using the BrainWeb MRI database. These images are based on ""gold-standard"" reference brain templates. This allows us to assess between- (same data set, different method) and also within-segmenter (same method, variation of image quality) comparability, for both of which we find pronounced variations in segmentation results for gray and white matter volumes. The calculated volumes deviate up to >10% from the reference values for gray and white matter depending on method and image quality. Sensitivity is best for SPM5, volumetric accuracy for gray and white matter was similar in SPM5 and FSL and batter than in FreeSurfer. FSL showed the highest stability for white (<5%), FreeSurfer (6.2%) for gray matter for constant image quality BrainWeb data. Between-segmenter comparisons show discrepancies of Lip to >20% for the simulated data and 24% on average for the real data sets, whereas within-method performance analysis uncovered volume differences of tip to >15%. Since the discrepancies between results reach the same order of magnitude as volume changes observed in disease, these effects limit the usability of the segmentation methods for following volume changes in individual patients over time and should be taken into account during the planning and analysis of brain volume studies.

741,738,"This article describes the combination of multivariate Ganger causality analysis, temporal down-sampling of fMRI time series, and graph theoretic concepts for investigating causal brain networks and their dynamics. As a demonstration, this approach was applied to analyze epoch-to-epoch changes in a hand-gripping, muscle fatigue experiment. Causal influences between the activated regions were analyzed by applying the directed transfer function (DTF) analysis of multivariate Granger causality with the integrated epoch response as the input, allowing us to account for the effects of several relevant regions simultaneously. Integrated responses were used in lieu of originally sampled time points to remove the effect of the spatially varying hemodynamic response as a confounding factor; using integrated responses did not affect our ability to capture its slowly varying affects of fatigue. We separately modeled the early, middle, and late periods in the fatigue. We adopted graph theoretic concepts of clustering and eccentricity to facilitate the interpretation of the resultant complex networks. Our results reveal the temporal evolution of the network and demonstrate that motor fatigue leads to a disconnection in the related neural network. Hum Brain Mapp 30: 1361-1373, 2009.

The procedure is formulated as finding maximum a posteriori estimates within a probabilistic generative model. Estimating the parameters involves alternating between estimating the deformations that match tissue class images of individual subjects to template, and updating the template according to the latest estimates of the deformations. A multinomial matching criterion is used, such that multiple tissue class images (e. g. grey and white matter) are registered simultaneously with the current template estimate. In order to generalise the resulting template to a broader range of subjects, a template blurriness prior is included within the model. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

744,741,"Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) can be used to estimate excess kurtosis, which is a dimensionless measure for the deviation of water diffusion pro. le from Gaussian distribution. Several recent studies have applied DKI to probe the restricted water diffusion in biological tissues. The directional analysis has also been developed to obtain the directionally specific kurtosis. However, these studies could not directly evaluate the sensitivity of DKI in detecting subtle neural tissue alterations. Brain maturation is known to involve various biological events that can affect water diffusion properties, thus providing a sensitive platform to evaluate the efficacy of DKI. In this study, in vivo DKI experiments were performed in normal Sprague-Dawley rats of 3 different ages: postnatal days 13, 31 and 120 (N=6 for each group). Regional analysis was then performed for 4 white matter (WM) and 3 gray matter (GM) structures. Diffusivity and kurtosis estimates derived from DKI were shown to be highly sensitive to the developmental changes in these chosen structures. Conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters were also computed using monoexponential model, yielding reduced sensitivity and directional specificity in monitoring the brain maturation changes. These results demonstrated that, by measuring directionally specific diffusivity and kurtosis, DKI offers a more comprehensive and sensitive detection of tissue microstructural changes. Such imaging advance can provide a better MR diffusion characterization of neural tissues, both WM and GM, in normal, developmental and pathological states. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

745,742,"The flow of information from sensory stimuli to motor responses in the human brain can be flexibly re-routed depending on task demands. However, it has remained unclear which sequence of processes is involved in preparing the brain for an upcoming task. Here, we used a combination of fMRI and multivariate pattern classification to decompose the information flow in a task-switching experiment. Specifically, we present a time-resolved decoding approach that allowed us to track the temporal buildup of task-related information. This approach also allowed us to distinguish encoding of the task from encoding of target stimuli and motor responses, thus separating between different components of information processing. We were able to decode from parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex which specific task-set a subject was currently holding. Importantly, this revealed that the intraparietal sulcus encoded task-set information before prefrontal cortex, and it was the only region to encode the specific task-set before the relevant target stimulus was presented. This suggests that task-related information in parietal cortex does not rely on input from prefrontal cortex as previously suggested. In contrast, our findings suggest that parietal cortex might play a role in establishing task-sets in prefrontal cortex. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We measured brain activity during creative thinking in two studies employing different neurophysiological measurement methods (EEG and fMRI). In both studies, participants worked on four verbal tasks differentially drawing on creative idea generation. The EEG study revealed that the generation of original ideas was associated with alpha synchronisation in frontal brain regions and with a diffuse and widespread pattern of alpha synchronisation over parietal cortical regions. The fMRI study revealed that task performance was associated with strong activation in frontal regions of the left hemisphere.

Although mounting evidence points towards a neuronal contribution to this activity, its functional role and dependence on behavioral state remain unclear. In this work, we used BOLD fMRI at 7 T to study the modulation of spontaneous activity in occipital areas by various behavioral conditions, including resting with eyes closed, eyes open with visual fixation, and eyes open with fixation and focal visual stimulation. Spontaneous activity was separated from evoked activity and from signal fluctuations related to cardiac and respiratory cycles. We found that spontaneous activity in visual areas was substantially reduced (amplitude (44%) and coherence (25%)) with the fixation conditions relative to the eyes-closed condition. No significant further modulation was observed when the visual stimulus was added. The observed dependence on behavioral condition suggests that part of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations represents neuronal activity. Possible mechanisms for the modulation of spontaneous activity by behavioral state are discussed. The observed linear superposition of spontaneous fMRI activity with focal evoked activity related to visual processing has important implications for fMRI studies, which ideally should take into account the effect of spontaneous activity to properly define brain activations during task conditions.

749,746,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, rapidly increasing in prevalence as the population ages. As the potential for disease-modifying therapy grows, a large body of literature has aimed at finding reliable, noninvasive biomarkers of AD, to allow for early intervention and sensitive tracking of therapeutic response. Task-related functional brain imaging techniques have been increasingly used to examine episodic memory function in AD. In the present study we completed a quantitative meta-analysis of this growing literature, to establish consensus and elucidate consistent patterns across this important research area. Results from encoding and retrieval paradigms were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique for patient and control groups. Second-level ALE analyses directly compared activation between these two groups. Results indicated a number of consistent findings across the included studies. Controls showed consistently greater activity than patients in a number of regions including the MTL and frontal pole across encoding and retrieval paradigms. Patients demonstrated increased activation likelihood in areas of the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex and other regions. Our findings quantitatively confirm the widely-cited deficits in MTL activity among AD patients, and also bring to light a pattern of differential prefrontal involvement, which may be implicated in compensatory changes occurring in AD. On the whole, this study quantitatively demonstrates that functional imaging studies show consistent, if complex, patterns of brain activation differences between patients and controls. These findings support the continued evaluation of functional neuroimaging for clinical use. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

750,747,"Patients with schizophrenia exhibit a decrease or loss of normal anatomical brain asymmetry that also extends to functional levels. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate language lateralization in patients with schizophrenia during their first episode of illness, thus excluding effects of chronic illness and treatment. Brain regions activated during language tasks of verb generation and passive music listening were explored in 12 first-episode patients with schizophrenia and 17 healthy controls. Regions of interest corresponded to Broca's area in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and Wernicke's area in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Patients with schizophrenia had significantly smaller lateralization indices in language-related regions than controls. A similar effect was observed in their IFG and STS regions. There was no difference between the groups in the auditory cortex for the music task. Patients with schizophrenia demonstrated greater activation than the controls in temporal regions: the difference was larger in patients with more severe positive symptom subscores. In conclusion, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated loss of normal functional brain asymmetry, as reflected in diminished lateralization of language-related activation in frontal and temporal regions. This phenomenon was already present during their first episode of psychosis, possibly reflecting developmental brain abnormalities of the illness. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

751,748,"Accumulating evidence suggests that altered cerebral white matter (WM) influences normal aging, and further that WM degeneration may modulate the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we conducted a study of differences in WM volume across the adult age span and in AD employing a newly developed, automated method for regional parcellation of the subcortical WM that uses curvature landmarks and gray matter (GM)/WM surface boundary information. This procedure measures the volume of gyral WM, utilizing a distance constraint to limit the measurements from extending into the centrum semiovale. Regional estimates were first established to be reliable across two scan sessions in 20 young healthy individuals. Next, the method was applied to a large clinically-characterized sample of 299 individuals including 73 normal older adults and 91 age-matched participants with very mild to mild AD. The majority of measured regions showed a decline in volume with increasing age, with strong effects found in bilateral fusiform, lateral orbitofrontal, superior frontal, medial orbital frontal, inferior temporal, and middle temporal WM. The association between WM volume and age was quadratic in many regions suggesting that WM volume loss accelerates in advanced aging. A number of WM regions were further reduced in AD with parahippocampal, entorhinal, inferior parietal and rostral middle frontal WM showing the strongest AD-associated reductions. There were minimal sex effects after correction for intracranial volume, and there were associations between ventricular volume and regional WM volumes in the older adults and AD that were not apparent in the younger adults. Certain results, such as the loss of WM in the fusiform region with aging, were unexpected and provide novel insight into patterns of age associated neural and cognitive decline. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of automated regional WM measures in revealing the distinct patterns of age and AD associated volume loss that may contribute to cognitive decline.

752,749,"The need to study molecular and functional parameters of Alzheimer's disease progression in animal models has led to the development of disease-specific fluorescent markers. However, curved optical interfaces and a highly heterogeneous internal structure make quantitative fluorescence imaging of the murine brain a particularly challenging tomographic problem. We investigated the integration of X-ray computed tomography (CT) information into a state-of-the-art fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) scheme and establish that the dual-modality approach is essential for high fidelity reconstructions of distributed fluorescence within the murine brain, as compared to conventional fluorescence tomography. We employ this method in vivo using a fluorescent oxazine dye to quantify amyloid-beta plaque burden in transgenic APP23 mice modeling Alzheimer's disease. Multi-modal imaging allows for accurate signal localization and correlation of in vivo findings to ex vivo studies. The results point to FMT-CT as an essential tool for in vivo study of neurodegenerative disease in animal models and potentially humans. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

753,750,"Objective: We aimed to investigate differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) between primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the relationship between FA and disease progression using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Methods: Two scanners at two different sites were used. Differences in FA between ALS patients and controls scanned in London were investigated. From the results of this analysis, brain regions were selected to test for (i) differences in FA between controls, patients with ALS and patients with PLS scanned in Oxford and (ii) the relationship between FA and disease progression rate in the Oxford patient groups. Results: London ALS patients showed a lower FA than controls in several brain regions. Oxford patients with PLS showed a lower FA than ALS patients and than controls in the body of the corpus callosum and in the white matter adjacent to the right primary motor cortex (PMC), while ALS patients showed reduced FA compared with PLS patients in the white matter adjacent to the Superior frontal gyrus. Significant correlations were found between disease progression rate and (i) FA in the white matter adjacent to the PMC in PLS, and (ii) FA along the cortico-spinal tract and in the body of the corpus callosum in ALS. Conclusions:: We described significant FA changes between PLS and ALS, suggesting that these two presentations of motor neuron disease show different features. The significant correlation between FA and disease progression rate in PLS suggests the tissue damage reflected in FA changes contributes to the disease progression rate.

754,751,"We propose a novel l(1)l(2)-norm inverse solver for estimating the sources of EEG/MEG signals. Based on the standard l(1)-norm inverse solvers, this sparse distributed inverse solver integrates the l(1)-norm spatial model with a temporal model of the source signals in order to avoid unstable activation patterns and ""spiky"" reconstructed signals often produced by the currently used sparse solvers. The joint spatio-temporal model leads to a cost function with an l(1)l(2)-norm regularizer whose minimization can be reduced to a convex second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem and efficiently solved using the interior-point method. The efficient computation of the SOCP problem allows us to implement permutation tests for estimating statistical significance of the inverse solution. Validation with simulated and human MEG data shows that the proposed solver yields source time course estimates qualitatively similar to those obtained through dipole fitting, but without the need to specify the number of dipole sources in advance. Furthermore, the l(1)l(2)-norm solver achieves fewer false positives and a better representation of the source locations than the conventional l(2) minimum-norm estimates. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

756,753,"This event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (er-fMRI) study investigated BOLD signal change in response to a series of pure gustatory stimuli that varied in stimulus quality when subjects were hungry and sated with a nutritional pre-load. Group analyses showed significant differences in activation in the hunger minus satiety condition in response to sucrose, caffeine, saccharin, and citric acid within the thalamus, hippocampus, and parahippocampus. When examining the hunger and satiety conditions, activation varied as a function of stimulus, with the majority of the stimuli exhibiting significantly greater activation in the hunger state within the insula, thalamus, and substantia nigra, in contrast to decreased activation in the satiated state within the parahippocampus, hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate. Region of interest (ROI) analysis revealed two significant interactions, ROI by physiology and ROI by physiology by stimulus. In the satiety condition, the primary (inferior and superior insulae) and secondary (OFC 11 and OFC 47) taste regions exhibited significantly greater brain activation in response to all stimuli than regions involved in processing eating behavior (hypothalamus), affect (amygdala), and memory (hippocampus, parahippocampus and entorhinal cortex). These same regions demonstrated significantly greater activation within the hunger condition than the satiety condition, with the exception of the superior insula. Furthermore, the patterns of activation differed as a function taste stimulus, with greater activation in response to sucrose than to the other stimuli. These differential patterns of activation suggest that the physiological states of hunger and satiety produce divergent activation in multiple brain areas in response to different pure gustatory stimuli.

757,754,"Recollecting autobiographical memories of personal past experiences is an integral part of our everyday lives and relies on a distributed set of brain regions. Their occurrence externally in the real world ('realness') and their self-relevance ('selfness') are two de. ning features of these autobiographical events. Distinguishing between personally experienced events and those that happened to other individuals, and between events that really occurred and those that were mere figments of the imagination, is clearly advantageous, yet the respective neural correlates remain unclear. Here we experimentally manipulated and dissociated realness and selfness during fMRI using a novel paradigm where participants recalled self (autobiographical) and non-self (from a movie or television news clips) events that were either real or previously imagined. Distinct sub-regions within dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, retrosplenial cortex and along the parieto-occipital sulcus preferentially coded for events (real or imagined) involving the self. By contrast, recollection of autobiographical events that really happened in the external world activated different areas within ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, recall of externally experienced real events (self or non-self) was associated with increased activity in areas of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Taken together our results permitted a functional deconstruction of anterior (medial prefrontal) and posterior (retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus) cortical midline regions widely associated with autobiographical memory but whose roles have hitherto been poorly understood.

Data were analyzed with SPM5 using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess main effects of diagnostic group and gender upon whole brain (WB) GMV. Post-hoc analyses were subsequently performed using SPSS to examine the extent to which clinical and illness history variables and psychotropic medication contributed to GMV abnormalities in BPI in a priori and non-a priori regions has demonstrated by the above VBM analyses. BPI showed reduced GMV in bilateral posteromedial rectal gyrus (PMRG), but no abnormalities in amygdala GMV.

GMV was significantly reduced in male low-trait anxiety BPI versus male low-trait anxiety HC, and in high-versus low-trait anxiety male BPI.

We tested this in our study with a novel paradigm of tonic pain induced by a single stimulus. Tonic pain, in contrast to phasic pain, seems to be a more appropriate experimental approach to study adaptive mechanisms of pain processing in FMS. We hypothesized that brain areas related to the ""medial"" pain system and the amygdalae will present different activation in patients compared to healthy subjects. An fMRI-block design before, during and after an incision was made in patients with FMS and in healthy controls. Acute pain caused by the incision was measured during the course of the experiment. A 2 factorial model of BOLD-signal changes was designed to explore significant differences of brain activation between both groups during the pain stimulus. Additionally the first Eigenvariates in those areas which show an interaction between both factors were determined over the time course of pain stimulation. Differences of activation in the fronto-cingulate cortex, the supplemental motor areas, and the thalamus were found between both groups with distinct differences in BOLD-signals changes over the time course of pain stimulation, even during anticipation of pain. Our results support the hypothesis that central mechanisms of pain processing in the medial pain system, favourable cognitive/affective factors even during the anticipation of pain, may play an important role for pain processing in patients with FMS.

762,759,"The inhibitory control of prepotent action is vital for appropriate behaviour. An example of the importance of such control can be seen in the inhibition of aggressive behavior, deficits in which may have broader consequences for society. Many studies have related lesions or the under-development of the prefrontal cortex to inefficiency of inhibitory control. Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and a stop-signal task, which occasionally requires the inhibition of a prepotent motor response, to investigate the role of pre-supplementary motor area (Pre-SMA) in inhibitory control. While no effects were seen on the ability to generate responses, TMS delivered over the Pre-SMA disrupted the ability to respond to a stop signal. These results are the first to establish a casual link between Pre-SMA and inhibitory control in normal subjects. The understanding of the underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control may lead to clearer understanding of the neural basis of inappropriate behaviour. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

While previous work has examined the neural systems involved in decision-making, there is a need to understand how the parameters associated with decision-making (e.g., magnitude of expected reward, probability of expected reward and risk) modulate activation within these neural systems. In the current fMRI study, we modified the monetary wheel of fortune (WOF) task [Ernst, M., Nelson, E. E., McClure, E. B., Monk, C.S., Munson, S., Eshel, N., et al. (2004).

Selection of high, relative to low, reward magnitude increased activity in insula, amygdala, middle and posterior cingulate cortex, and basal ganglia. Selection of low-probability, as opposed to high-probability reward, increased activity in anterior cingulate cortex, as did selection of risky, relative to safe reward. In summary, decision-making that did not involve conflict, as in the magnitude contrast, recruited structures known to support the coding of reward values, and those that integrate motivational and perceptual information for behavioral responses. In contrast, decision-making under conflict, as in the probability and risk contrasts, engaged the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex whose role in conflict monitoring is well established. However, decision-making under conflict failed to activate the structures that track reward values per se. Thus, the presence of conflict in decision-making seemed to significantly alter the pattern of neural responses to simple rewards.

764,761,"Objective: Examination of cerebral cortical structure in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has thus far been principally limited to volume measures. In the current study, an automated Surface-based analysis technique was used to examine the ADHD-associated differences in additional morphologic features of cerebral cortical gray matter structure, including surface area, thickness, and cortical folding. Methods: MPRAGE images were acquired from 21 children with ADHD (9 girls) and 35 typically developing controls (15 girls), aged 8-12 years. Statistical difference maps were used to compare mean cortical thickness between groups along the cortical surface. Cortical volume, surface area, mean thickness, and cortical folding were measured within regions of interest, including the right/left hemispheres, frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes within each hemisphere, and sub-lobar regions. Results: Children with ADHD showed a decrease in total cerebral volume and total cortical volume of over 7 and 8%, respectively; volume reduction was observed throughout the cortex, with significant reduction in all four lobes bilaterally. The ADHD group also showed a decrease in surface area of over 7% bilaterally, and a significant decrease in cortical folding bilaterally. No significant differences in cortical thickness were detected. Conclusions: Results from the present study reveal that ADHD is associated with decreased cortical volume, surface area, and folding throughout the cerebral cortex. The findings suggest that decreased cortical folding is a key morphologic feature associated with ADHD. This Would be consistent with onset early in neural development and could help to identify neurodevelopmental mechanisms that contribute-to ADHD. Hum Brain Mapp 30:175-184, 2009.

765,762,"To determine the functional connectivity of different EEG bands at the ""baseline"" situation (rest) and during mathematical thinking in children and young adults to study the maturation effect on brain networks at rest and during a cognitive task. Methods: Twenty children (8-12 years) and twenty students (21-26 years) were studied. The synchronization likelihood was used to evaluate the interregional synchronization of different EEG frequency bands in children and adults, at rest and during math. Then, graphs were constructed and characterized in terms of local structure (clustering coefficient) and overall integration (path length) and the ""optimal"" organization of the connectivity i.e., the small world network (SWN). Results: The main findings were: (i) Enhanced synchronization for theta band during math more prominent in adults. (ii) Decrease of the optimal SWN organization of the alpha2 band during math. (iii) The beta and especially gamma bands showed lower synchronization and signs of lower SWN organization in both situations in adults. Conclusion: There are interesting findings related to the two age groups and the two situations. The theta band showed higher synchronization during math in adults as a result of higher capacity of the working memory in this age group. The alpha2 band showed some SWN disorganization during math, a process analog to the known desynchronization. In adults, a dramatic reduction of the connections in gray matter occurs. Although this maturation process is probably related to higher efficiency, reduced connectivity is expressed by lower synchronization and lower mean values of the graph parameters in adults.

766,763,"There is current interest in understanding genetic influences on both healthy and disordered brain function. We assessed brain function with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected during an auditory oddball task-detecting an infrequent sound within a series of frequent sounds. Then, task-related imaging findings were utilized as potential intermediate phenotypes (endophenotypes) to investigate genomic factors derived from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Our target is the linkage of these genomic factors to normal/abnormal brain functionality. We explored parallel independent component analysis (paralCA) is a new method for analyzing multimodal data. The method was aimed to identify simultaneously independent components of each modality and the relationships between them. When :13 healthy controls and 20 schizophrenia patients, all Caucasian, were studied, we found a correlation of 0.38 between one fMRI component and one SNP component. This fMRI component consisted mainly of parietal lobe activations. The relevant SNP component was contributed to significantly by 10 SNPs located in genes, including those coding for the nicotinic alpha-7cholinergic receptor, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, disrupted in schizophrenia 1, among others. Both fMRI and SNP components showed significant differences in loading parameters between the schizophrenia and control groups (P = 0.0006 for the fMRI component; P = 0.001 for the SNP component). In summary, we constructed a framework to identify interactions between brain functional and genetic information; our findings provide a proof-of-concept that genomic SNP factors can be investigated by using endophenotypic imaging findings in a multivariate format.

767,764,"FMRI research in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) typically is aimed at determining regional changes in brain function, most commonly by creating a model of the expected BOLD-response and estimating its magnitude using a general linear model (GLM) analysis. This crucially depends on the suitability of the temporal assumptions of the model and on assumptions about normality of group distributions. Exploratory data analysis techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) do not depend on these assumptions and are able to detect unknown, yet structured spatiotemporal processes in neuroirnaging data. Tensorial probabilistic ICA (T-PICA) is a model free technique that can be used for analyzing multiple subjects and groups, extracting signals of interest (components) in the spatial, temporal, and also subject domain of FMRI data. We applied T-PICA and model-based GLM to study FMRI signal during face encoding in 18 AD, 28 MCI patients, and 41 healthy elderly controls. T-PICA showed activation in regions associated with motor, visual, and cognitive processing, and deactivation in the default mode network. Six networks showed a significantly decreased response in patients. For two networks the T-PICA technique was significantly more sensitive to detect group differences than the standard model-based technique. We conclude that T-PICA is a promising tool to identify and detect differences in (de)activated brain networks in elderly controls and dementia patients. The technique is more sensitive than the commonly applied model-based method. Consistent with other research, we show that networks of activation and deactivation show decreased reactivity in dementia. Hum Brain Mapp 30:256-266, 2009. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss.

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is one of the most widely used of such techniques. VBM performs voxel-wise statistical analysis of smoothed spatially normalised segmented Magnetic Resonance Images. There are several reasons why the analysis should include only voxels within a certain mask. We show that one of the most commonly used strategies for de. ning this mask runs a major risk of excluding from the analysis precisely those voxels where the subjects' brains were most vulnerable to atrophy. We investigate the issues related to mask construction, and recommend the use of alternative strategies which greatly decrease this danger of false negatives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We find that this method produces highly predictive models of fMRI data that provide evidence for the distributed nature of neural function. We also use the flexibility of Elastic Net to demonstrate that model robustness can be improved without compromising predictability, in turn revealing the importance of localized clusters of activity. Our findings highlight the functional significance of patterns of distributed clusters of localized activity, and underscore the importance of models that are both predictive and interpretable.

774,771,"Since hippocampal volume has been found to be an early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, there is large interest in automated methods to accurately, robustly, and reproducibly extract the hippocampus from MRI data. In this work we present a segmentation method based on the minimization of an energy functional with intensity and prior terms, which are derived from manually labelled training images. The intensity energy is based on a statistical intensity model that is learned from the training images. The prior energy consists of a spatial and regularity term. The spatial prior is obtained from a probabilistic atlas created by registering the training images to the unlabelled target image, and deforming and averaging the training labels. The regularity prior energy encourages smooth segmentations. The resulting energy functional is globally minimized using graph cuts. The method was evaluated using image data from a population-based study on diseases among the elderly. Two set of images were used: a small set of 20 manually labelled MR images and a larger set of 498 images, for which manual volume measurements were available, but no segmentations. This data was previously used in a volumetry study that found significant associations between hippocampal volume and cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Cross-validation experiments with the labelled set showed similarity indices of 0.852 and 0.864 and mean surface distances of 0.40 and 0.36 mm for the left and right hippocampus. 83% of the automated segmentations of the large set were rated as 'good' by a trained observer. Also, the proposed method was used to repeat the manual hippocampal volumetry study. The automatically obtained hippocampal volumes showed significant associations with cognitive decline and dementia, similar to the manually measured volumes. Finally, direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons showed that the proposed method outperforms a multi-atlas based segmentation method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

775,772,"Lately, neuroscience is showing a great interest in examining the functional and neural mechanisms which support action observation and understanding. Recent studies have suggested that our motor skills crucially affect the way in which we perceive the actions generated by others, by showing stronger motor resonance for observation of actions that are established in one's motor repertoire. In the present study we extend previous findings that were based on expert motor skills in adults to the natural development of actions in infants. To investigate the effect of natural motor experience on motor resonance during action observation, 14- to 16-month-old infants' EEG was recorded during observation of action videos. Stronger mu- and betadesynchronizations were found for observation of crawling compared to walking videos and the size of the effect was strongly related to the infant's own crawling experience. This suggests that already early in life one's own action experience is closely related to how actions of others are perceived. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, we explored the relation between symptom severity and brain regions with decreased volumes in MDD participants. The study group comprised 22 women diagnosed with MDD and 25 healthy women with no history of major psychiatric disorders. Magnetic resonance brain images were analyzed using optimized voxel-based morphometry to examine group differences in regional gray and white matter volume. Compared with healthy controls, MDD participants were found to have decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral caudate nucleus and the thalamus. No group differences were found for white matter volume, nor were there significant correlations between gray matter volumes and symptom severity within the MDD group. The present results suggest that smaller volume of the caudate nucleus may be related to the pathophysiology of MDD and may account for abnormalities of the cortico-striatal-pallido-thalamic loop in MDD.

777,774,"In neuroimaging research on attention, cognitive control, decision-making, and other areas where response time (RT) is a critical variable, the temporal variability associated with the decision is often assumed to be inconsequential to the hemodynamic response (HDR) in rapid event-related designs. On this basis, the majority of published studies model brain activity lasting less than 4 s with brief impulses representing the onset of neural or cognitive events, which are then convolved with the hemodynamic impulse response function (HRF). However, electrophysiological studies have shown that decision-related neuronal activity is not instantaneous, but in fact, often lasts until the motor response. It is therefore possible that small differences in neural processing durations, similar to human RTs, will produce noticeable changes in the HDR, and therefore in the results of regression analyses. In this study we compare the effectiveness of traditional models that assume no temporal variance with a model that explicitly accounts for the duration of very brief epochs of neural activity. Using both simulations and fMRI data, we show that brief differences in duration are detectable, making it possible to dissociate the effects of stimulus intensity from stimulus duration, and that optimizing the model for the type of activity being detected improves the statistical power, consistency, and interpretability of results.

778,775,"Empathy allows us to simulate others' affective and cognitive mental states internally, and it has been proposed that the mirroring or motor representation systems play a key role in such simulation. As emotions are related to important adaptive events linked with benefit or danger, simulating others' emotional states might constitute of a special case of empathy. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we tested if emotional versus cognitive empathy would facilitate the recruitment of brain networks involved in motor representation and imitation in healthy volunteers. Participants were presented with photographs depicting people in neutral everyday situations (cognitive empathy blocks), or suffering serious threat or harm (emotional empathy blocks). Participants were instructed to empathize with specified persons depicted in the scenes. Emotional versus cognitive empathy resulted in increased activity in limbic areas involved in emotion processing (thalamus), and also in cortical areas involved in face (fusiform gyrus) and body perception, as well as in networks associated with mirroring of others' actions (inferior parietal lobule). When brain activation resulting from viewing the scenes was controlled, emotional empathy still engaged the mirror neuron system (premotor cortex) more than cognitive empathy. Further, thalamus and primary somatosensory and motor cortices showed increased functional coupling during emotional versus cognitive empathy. The results suggest that emotional empathy is special. Emotional empathy facilitates somatic, sensory, and motor representation of other peoples' mental states, and results in more vigorous mirroring of the observed mental and bodily states than cognitive empathy.

779,776,"Recent models of language comprehension have assumed a tight coupling between the semantic representations of action words and cortical motor areas. We combined functional MRI with cytoarchitectonically defined probabilistic maps of left hemisphere primary and premotor cortices to analyse responses of functionally delineated execution- and observation-related regions during comprehension of action word meanings associated with specific effectors (e. g., punch, bite or stomp) and processing of items with various levels of lexical information (non body part-related meanings, nonwords, and visual character strings). The comprehension of effector specific action word meanings did not elicit preferential activity corresponding to the somatotopic organisation of effectors in either primary or premotor cortex. However, generic action word meanings did show increased BOLD signal responses compared to all other classes of lexical stimuli in the pre-SMA. As expected, the majority of the BOLD responses elicited by the lexical stimuli were in association cortex adjacent to the motor areas. We contrast our results with those of previous studies reporting significant effects for only 1 or 2 effectors outside cytoarchitectonically defined motor regions and discuss the importance of controlling for potentially confounding lexical variables such as imageability. We conclude that there is no strong evidence for a somatotopic organisation of action word meaning representations and argue the pre-SMA might have a role in maintaining abstract representations of action words as instructional cues.

Statistical analysis by applying the general linear model showed significant activation in the prefrontal cortex, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal eye field after external perturbation, regardless of the preceding auditory warning signals. A time-line analysis revealed similar temporal profiles for prefrontal activation in 2 different conditions. Based on the contrast between the 2 conditions, we detected enhanced activation in the right posterior parietal cortex and supplementary motor area in the condition where the auditory warning signals were provided.

During each iteration of ACM - our extension of AdaBoost the Bayesian posterior distribution of the labeling was fed back in as an input, along with its neighborhood features as new features for AdaBoost to use. In validation studies, we compared our results with hand-labeled segmentations by two experts. Using a leave-one-out approach and standard overlap and distance error metrics, our automated segmentations agreed well with human raters; any differences were comparable to differences between trained human raters. Our error metrics compare favorably with those previously reported for other automated hippocampal segmentations, suggesting the utility of the approach for large-scale studies.

782,779,"Recent studies have used pattern classification algorithms to predict or decode task parameters from individual fMRI activity patterns. For fMRI decoding, it is important to choose an appropriate set of voxels (or features) as inputs to the decoder, since the presence of many irrelevant voxels could lead to poor generalization performance, a problem known as overfitting. Although individual voxels could be chosen based on univariate statistics, the resulting set of voxels could be suboptimal if correlations among voxels carry important information. Here, we propose a novel linear classification algorithm, called sparse logistic regression (SLR), that automatically selects relevant voxels while estimating their weight parameters for classification. Using simulation data, we confirmed that SLR can automatically remove irrelevant voxels and thereby attain higher classification performance than other methods in the presence of many irrelevant voxels. SLR also proved effective with real fMRI data obtained from two visual experiments, Successfully identifying voxels in corresponding locations of visual Cortex. SI-R-selected voxels often led to better performance than those selected based on univariate statistics, by exploiting correlated noise among voxels to allow for better pattern separation. We Conclude that SLR provides a robust method for fMRI decoding and can also serve as a stand-alone tool for voxel selection. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

784,781,"Most violent crimes in Western societies are committed by a small group of men who display antisocial behavior from an early age that remains stable across the life-span. It is not known if these men display abnormal brain structure. We compared regional brain volumes of 26 persistently violent offenders with antisocial personality disorder and substance dependence and 25 healthy men using magnetic resonance imaging volumetry and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The violent offenders, as compared with the healthy men, had markedly larger white matter volumes, bilaterally, in the occipital and parietal lobes, and in the left cerebellum, and larger grey matter volume in right cerebellum (effect sizes up to 1.24, P < 0.001). Among the offenders, volumes of these areas were not associated with psychopathy scores, substance abuse, psychotropic medication, or global IQ scores. By contrast, VBM analyses of grey matter revealed focal, symmetrical, bilateral areas of atrophy in the postcentral gyri, frontopolar cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex among the offenders as compared with the healthy men (z-scores as high as 5.06). Offenders with psychopathy showed the smallest volumes in these areas. The larger volumes in posterior brain areas may reflect atypical neurodevelopmental processes that underlie early-onset persistent antisocial and aggressive behavior. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

785,782,"Dysfunction of the frontal-subcortical circuits has been the most common finding in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and recent neuropsychological studies have shown cognitive impairments in OCD. To clarify the pathophysiology of OCD without the confounding effects of medication, we investigated the alterations of brain function in OCD patients and changes after clinical improvement due solely to behavior therapy. The participants were 11 outpatients with OCD and 19 normal controls. The patients received 12 weeks of behavior therapy. We investigated the differences in the behavioral performance and functional magnetic resonance imaging results during the Stroop test in the patients and normal controls, and their changes after treatment in the patients. The patients showed less activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus and cerebellum than control subjects. Following significant improvement in OC symptoms, the cerebellum and parietal lobe showed increased activation, and the orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and temporal regions showed decreased activation during the Stroop task, and performance of the task itself unproved. Our findings Suggest that dysfunction of the posterior brain regions, especially the cerebellum, is involved in the pathogenesis of OCD, and that normalization in function can occur with improvement of OC symptoms.

786,783,"The olfactory bulb (OB) is considered to be the most important relay station in odor processing. Involving 125 randomly selected subjects (58 men, 67 women; age range: 19 to 79 years), the present study aimed to investigate a possible correlation between OB volume and specific olfactory functions including odor threshold, odor discrimination, and odor identification. The history of all participants was taken in great detail to exclude possible Causes of smell dysfunction. All participants received an otolaryngological investigation including a volumetric scan of the brain (MRI), lateralized olfactory tests and a screen for cognitive impairment. Volumetric measurements of the right and left OB were performed by manual segmentation of the coronal slices through the OB. Significant correlations between OB Volumes in relation to olfactory function were observed, independent of the subjects' age. Additionally, OB volumes decreased with age. In agreement with previous research the present study confirmed the correlation between OB Volume and specific olfactory functions. Furthermore, the correlation between OB volume and olfactory function was not mediated by the Subjects' age. In conclusion, the present data obtained from a relatively large group of subjects forms the basis for age-related normative values of OB volumes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

787,784,"The present fMRI study investigates the neural basis of hierarchical processing using two types of artificial grammars: one governed by rules of adjacent dependencies and the other by rules of hierarchical dependencies. The adjacent dependency sequences followed the rule (AB)(n), at which simple transitions between two types of syllable categories were generated (e.g. A(1)B(1)A(2)B(2)). The hierarchical syllable sequences. followed the rule A(n)B(n), generating a center-embedded structure (e.g. A(2)A(1)B(1)B(2)) the learning of which required the processing of hierarchical dependencies. When comparing the processing of hierarchical dependencies to adjacent dependencies, significantly higher activations were observed in Broca's area and the adjacent rim of the ventral premotor cortex (BA 44/6) in addition to some several other cortical and subcortical regions. These results indicate that Broca's area is part of a neural circuit that is responsible for the Processing of hierarchical structures in an artificial grammar. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

788,785,"While the Talairach atlas remains the most commonly used system for reporting coordinates in neuroimaging studies, the absence of an actual 3-D image of the original brain used in its construction has severely limited the ability of researchers to automatically map locations from 3-D anatomical MRI images to the atlas. Previous work in this area-attempted to circumvent this problem by constructing approximate linear and piecewise-linear mappings between standard brain templates (e.g. the MNI template) and Talairach space. These methods are limited in that they can only. account for differences in overall brain size and orientation but cannot correct for the actual shape differences between the,MNI template and the Taiairach brain. In this paper we describe our work to digitize the Talairach atlas and generate a nonlinear mapping between the Talairach atlas and the MNI template that attempts to compensate for the actual differences in shape between the two, resulting in more accurate coordinate transformations. We present examples in this paper and note that the method is available freely online as a Java applet. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), in which subjects inflate a virtual balloon that can either grow larger or explode [Lejuez, C.W., Read,J.P., Kahler, C.W., Richards, J.B., Ramsey, S.E., Stuart, G.L., Strong, D.R., Brown, R.A., 2002. Evaluation of a behavioral measure of risk taking: the Balloon Analogue Risk Task BART J. Exp. Psychol. Appl. 8, 75-84], provides all ecologically valid model to assess human risk taking propensity and behaviour. In the present study, we modified this task For use during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and administered it in both ail active choice mode and a passive no-choice mode in order to examine the neural correlates of voluntary and involuntary risk taking in the human brain. Voluntary risk in the active choice task is associated with robust activation in mesolimbic-frontal regions, including the midbrain, ventral and dorsal striatum, anterior insula, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortex (ACC/MFC), in addition to activation in visual pathway regions. However, these mesolimbic-frontal activation patterns were not observed for involuntary risk in the passive no-choice task. Decision making was associated with neural activity in the right DLPFC. These findings demonstrate the utility of the modified BART paradigms for using during fMRI to assess risk taking in the human brain, and suggest that recruitment of the brain mesolimbic-frontal pathway during risk-taking is Contingent upon the agency of the risk taker. The present paradigm may be extended to pathological Populations to determine the specific neural components of their impaired risk behavior. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

790,787,"Using dynamic causal modelling (DCM), we have presented provisional evidence to Suggest: (i) the mismatch negativity (MMN) is generated by self-organised interactions within a hierarchy of cortical sources [Garrido, M.I., Kilner, J.M., Kiebel, S.J., Stephan, K.E., Friston, K.J., 2007. Dynamic causal modelling of evoked potentials: a reproducibility Study. NeuroImage 36, 571-580] and (ii) the MMN tests on plastic change in both extrinsic (between-source) and intrinsic (within Source) connections (Garrido et al., Under review). In this work we revisit these two key issues in the context of the roving paradigm. Critically, this paradigm allows Lis to discount any differential response to differences in the stimuli per se, because the standards and oddballs are physically identical. We were able to confirm both the hierarchical nature of the MMN generation and the conjoint role of changes in extrinsic and intrinsic connections. These findings are consistent with a predictive coding account of repetition-suppression and the MMN, which gracefully accommodates two important mechanistic perspectives: the model-adjustment hypothesis [Winkler, I., Karmos, G., Naatanen, R., 1996.

792,789,"MR diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was proposed recently to study the deviation of water diffusion from Gaussian distribution. Mean kurtosis, the directionally averaged kurtosis, has been shown to be useful in assessing pathophysiological changes, thus yielding another dimension of information to characterize water diffusion in biological tissues. In this study, ortbogonal transformation of the 4th order diffusion kurtosis tensor was introduced to compute the diffusion kurtoses along the three eigenvector directions of the 2nd order diffusion tensor. Such axial (K-11) and radial (K-L) kurtoses measured the kurtoses along the directions parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the principal diffusion direction. DKI experiments were performed in normal adult (N=7) and formalin-fixed rat brains (N=5). DKI estimates were documented for various white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) tissues, and compared with the conventional diffusion tensor estimates. The results showed that kurtosis estimates revealed different information for tissue characterization. For example, K11 and K-L under formalin fixation condition exhibited large and moderate increases in WM while they showed little change in GM despite the overall dramatic decrease of axial and radial diffusivities in both WM and GM. These findings indicate that directional kurtosis analysis can provide additional microstructural information in characterizing neural tissues. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

No GM loss was found in CIS patients. Compared to CIS patients, those with RRMS had a significant GM loss in the right pre and postcentral gyri. Compared to RRMS, SPMS patients had a significant GM loss in several regions of the fronto-parieto-temporo-occipital lobes, the cerebellum and superior and inferior colliculus, bilaterally, and deep GM structures. Compared to PPMS, SPMS patients had a significant GM loss in the postcentral gyros, the cuncus, the middle occipital gyrus, the thalamus, the cerebellum, and the superior and inferior colliculus. In all MS groups, regional GM loss was strongly/moderately correlated with brain T2 LV. In SPMS and PPMS patients, a correlation was found between cortical regional GM loss and T2 LV of the corresponding or adjacent lobes. In MS patients, GM volume loss follows different patterns of regional distribution according to the clinical phenotype of the disease, is likely secondary to the presence and topography of focal WM inflammatory-demyelinating lesions, and is more evident in the progressive forms of the disease.

795,792,"Our objective was to investigate whether asymptomatic carriers of apolipoprotein E e4 [APOE-4] demonstrate pathological differences and atrophy in medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We measured cortical thickness and volume in MTL subregions (hippocampal CA fields 1, 2 and 3; dentate gyrus; entorhinal cortex; subiculum; perirhinal cortex; parahippocampal cortex; and fusiform gyrus) using a high-resolution in-plane (0.4 x 0.4 mm) MRI sequence in 30 cognitively normal volunteers (14 APOE-4 carriers, 16 non-carriers, mean age 57 years). A cortical unfolding procedure maximized the visibility of this convoluted cortex, providing cortical ribbon thickness measures throughout individual subregions of the hippocampus and surrounding cortex. APOE-4 carriers had reduced cortical thickness compared with non-carriers in entorhinal cortex (ERC) and the subiculum (Sub), but not in the main hippocampal body or perirhinal cortex. Average cortical thickness was 14.8% lower (p = 1.0e(-6)) for ERC and 12.6% lower (p = 6.8e(-5)) for Sub in APOE-4 carriers. Standard volumetric measures of the same regions showed similar, but non-significant trends. Cognitively intact carriers of APOE-4 show regionally specific thinning of the cortical ribbon compared to APOE-3 carriers; cortical thickness may be a more sensitive measure of pathological differences in genetic risk subjects than standard volumetry.

For each subject, tract-specific measurements of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were made within the inferior, middle, superior cerebellar peduncles and short intracerebellar fibres. No group differences were observed in mean diffusivity. However, people with Asperger syndrome had significantly lower fractional anisotropy in the short intracerebellar fibres (p < 0.001) and right superior cerebellar (output) peduncle (p < 0.001) compared to controls; but no difference in the input tracts. Severity of social impairment, as measured by the Autistic Diagnostic Interview, was negatively correlated with diffusion anisotropy in the fibres of the left superior cerebellar peduncle. These findings suggest a vulnerability of specific cerebellar neural pathways in people with Asperger syndrome. The localised abnormalities in the main cerebellar outflow pathway may prevent the cerebral cortex from receiving those cerebellar feedback inputs necessary for a successful adaptive social behaviour.

797,794,"The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of MRI-based high-dimensional pattern classification in differentiating between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and healthy controls, on an individual patient basis. MRI scans of 37 patients with AD and 37 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, as well as 12 patients with FTD and 12 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, were analyzed using voxel-based analysis and high-dimensional pattern classification. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of spatial patterns of regional brain atrophy found to be characteristic of AD and FTD were determined via cross-validation and via split-sample methods. Complex spatial patterns of relatively reduced brain volumes were identified, including temporal, orbitofrontal, parietal and cingulate regions, which were predominantly characteristic of either AD or FTD. These patterns provided 100% diagnostic accuracy, when used to separate AD or FTD from healthy controls. The ability to correctly distinguish AD from FTD averaged 84.3%. All estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined via cross-validation. In conclusion, AD-and FTD-specific patterns of brain atrophy can be detected with high accuracy using high-dimensional pattern classification of MRI scans obtained in a typical clinical setting.

798,795,"In this paper, we propose a new automated procedure for lesion identification from single images based on the detection of outlier voxels. We demonstrate the utility of this procedure using artificial and real lesions. The scheme rests on two innovations: First, we augment the generative model used for combined segmentation and normalization of images, with an empirical prior for an atypical tissue class, which can be optimised iteratively. Second, we adopt a fuzzy clustering procedure to identify outlier voxels in normalised gray and white matter segments. These two advances suppress misclassification of voxels and restrict lesion identification to gray/white matter lesions respectively. Our analyses show a high sensitivity for detecting and delineating brain lesions with different sizes, locations, and textures. Our approach has important implications for the generation of lesion overlap maps of a given population and the assessment of lesion-deficit mappings. From a clinical perspective, our method should help to compute the total volume of lesion or to trace precisely lesion boundaries that might be pertinent for surgical or diagnostic purposes.

799,796,"Although numerous behavioural studies provide evidence that there exist wide differences within individual motor imagery (MI) abilities, little is known with regards to the functional neuroanatomical networks that dissociate someone with good versus poor MI capacities. For the first time, we thus compared, through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the pattern of cerebral activations in 13 skilled and 15 unskilled imagers during both physical execution and MI of a sequence of finger movements. Differences in MI abilities were assessed using well-established questionnaire and chronometric measures, as well as a new index based upon the subject's peripheral responses from the autonomic nervous system. As expected, both good and poor imagers activated the inferior and superior parietal lobules, as well as motor-related regions including the lateral and medial premotor cortex, the cerebellum and putamen. Inter-group comparisons revealed that good imagers activated more the parietal and ventrolateral premotor regions, which are known to play a critical role in the generation of mental images. By contrast, poor imagers recruited the cerebellum, orbito-frontal and posterior cingulate cortices. Consistent with findings from the motor sequence learning literature and Doyon and Ungerleider's model of motor learning [Doyon, J., Ungerleider, L. G., 2002. Functional anatomy of motor skill learning. In: Squire, L. R., Schacter, D. L. (Eds.), Neuropsychology of memory, Guilford Press, pp. 225-238], our results demonstrate that compared to skilled imagers, poor imagers not only need to recruit the cortico-striatal system, but to compensate with the cortico-cerebellar system during MI of sequential movements.

The aim of the study was to investigate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), hippocampal and amygdala volumes in a first-presentation teenage BPD sample with minimal exposure to treatment. Groups of 20 BPD patients and 20 healthy control participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Hippocampal, amygdala, OFC and whole brain volumes were estimated and compared between the two groups. Analysis of variance revealed reversal of the normal (right > left) asymmetry of OFC grey matter volume in the BPD group, reflecting right-sided OFC grey matter loss in the BPD group compared with control participants. No significant differences were found for amygdala or hippocampal volumes comparing BPD with control participants. We identified OFC but not hippocampal or amygdala volumetric differences early in the course of BPD. Hippocampal and amygdala volume reductions observed in adult BPD samples might develop during the course of the disorder, although longitudinal studies are needed to examine this.

802,799,"To understand the effects of a cortical lesion it is necessary to consider not only the loss of local neural function, but also the lesion-induced changes in the larger network of endogenous oscillatory interactions in the brain. To investigate how network embedding influences a region's functional role, and the consequences of its being damaged, we implement two models of oscillatory cortical interactions, both of which inherit their coupling architecture from the available anatomical connection data for macaque cerebral cortex. In the first model, node dynamics are governed by Kuramoto phase oscillator equations, and we investigate the sequence in which areas entrain one another in the transition to global synchrony. In the second model, node dynamics are governed by a more realistic neural mass model, and we assess long-run inter-regional interactions using a measure of directed information flow. Highly connected parietal and frontal areas are found to synchronize most rapidly, more so than equally highly connected visual and somatosensory areas, and this difference can be explained in terms of the network's clustered architecture. For both models, lesion effects extend beyond the immediate neighbors of the lesioned site, and the amplitude and dispersal of nonlocal effects are again influenced by cluster patterns in the network. Although the consequences of in vivo lesions will always depend on circuitry local to the damaged site, we conclude that lesions of parietal regions (especially areas 5 and 7a) and frontal regions (especially areas 46 and FEF) have the greatest potential to disrupt the integrative aspects of neocortical function.",Dynamical consequences of lesions in cortical networks,2008,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,Article,18438885,['nomethod'],2.37,nomethod

804,801,"This paper presents a variational treatment of dynamic models that furnishes time-dependent conditional densities on the path or trajectory of a system's states and the time-independent densities of its parameters. These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperpara-meters using exactly the same principles. We refer to this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM). (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, little is known about whether the spontaneous brain activity at rest is relevant to the differences in intelligence.

We found that the brain regions in which the strength of the FC significantly correlated with intelligence scores were distributed in the frontal, parietal, occipital and limbic lobes. Stepwise linear regression analysis also revealed that the FCs within the frontal lobe and between the frontal and posterior brain regions were both important predictive factors for the differences in intelligence. These findings support a network view of intelligence, as suggested in previous studies.

Seventy-five normal healthy school going ethnic Chinese students and young adults of three age groups were recruited (group 1, n = 24, mean +/- SD = 7.4 +/- 0.3 years; group 2, n = 27, mean +/- SD = 10.3 +/- 0.5 years; group 3, n = 24, mean +/- SD = 22.8 +/- 2.3 years). DTI was performed with 3 mm isotropic resolution to cover the entire brain. Voxel-wise analysis was performed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to localize regions of white matter showing significant changes of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial and radial diffusivities between groups. We found increased FA and decreased MD with increasing age in regions of cerebellar white matter, right temporal white matter, and a large portion of the superior frontal and parietal white matter driven by both the reduction of radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity with the former to a greater extent. Changes were continual from late childhood to young adulthood. Findings were confirmed by region-of-interest analysis in specific white matter tracts. After controlling for the effect of age, significant correlation was found between diffusion indices of the anterior limb of the left internal capsule and Chinese reading score (p = 0.05), and of the corona radiata and English reading score (p = 0.026 and p = 0.029 for left and right, respectively).

How to extract directions of information flow in brain networks from these data remains a key challenge. Research over the last few years has identified Granger causality as a statistically principled technique to furnish this capability. The estimation of Granger causality currently requires autoregressive modeling of neural data. Here, we propose a nonparametric approach based on widely used Fourier and wavelet transforms to estimate both pairwise and conditional measures of Granger causality, eliminating the need of explicit autoregressive data modeling.

810,807,"Eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) are essential behaviors in mammalians, including man. At resting EC-EO state, brain activity in the default mode devoid of task-demand has recently been established in fMRI. However, the corresponding comprehensive electrophysiological conditions are little known even though EEG has been recorded in humans for nearly 80 years. In this study, we examined the spatial characteristics of spectral distribution in EEG field powers, i.e., sitting quietly with an EC and EO resting state of 3 min each, measured with high-density 128-ch EEG recording and FFT signal analyses in 15 right-handed healthy college females. Region of interest was set at a threshold at 90% of the spectral effective value to delimit the dominant spatial field power of effective energy in brain activity. Low-frequency delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) EEG field power was distributed at the prefrontal area with great expansion of spatial field and enhancement of field power (t = -2.72, p < 0.02) from the EC to the EO state. Theta (4-7 Hz) EEG field power was distributed over the fronto-central area and leaned forward from EC to the EO state but with drastic reduction in field power (t = 4.04, p < 0.01). The middle-frequency alpha-1 (7.5-9.5 Hz) and alpha-2 (10-12 Hz) EEG powers exhibited bilateral distribution over the posterior areas with an anterior field in lower alpha-1. Both showed significantly reduction of field powers (respectively, W = 120, p < 0.001 for alpha-1; t = 4.12, p < 0.001 for alpha-2) from EC to the EO state. Beta-1 (13-23 Hz) exhibited a similar spatial region over the posterior area as in alpha-2 and showed reduction of field power (t = 4.42, p < 0.001) from EC to the EO state. In contrast, high-frequency beta-2 and gamma band exhibited similar, mainly prefrontal distribution in field power, and exhibited no change from EC to the EO state. Corresponding correlation analyses indicated significant group association between EC and EO only in the field powers of delta (r = 0.95, p < 0.001) and theta (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) band. In addition, the great inter-individual variability (90 folds in alpha-1, 62 folds in alpha-2) in regional field power was largely observed in the EC state (10 folds) than the EO state in subjects. To summarize, our study depicts a network of spectral EEG activities simultaneously operative at well defined regional fields in the EC state, varying specifically between EC and EO states. In contrast to transient EEG spectral rhythmic dynamics, current study of long-lasting (e. g. 3 min) spectral field powers can characterize state features in EEG. The EEG default mode network (EEG-DMN) of spectral field powers at rest in the respective EC or EO state is valued to serve as the basal electrophysiological condition in human brain. In health, this EEG-DMN is deemed essential for evaluation of brain functions without task demands for gender difference, developmental change in age span, and brain response to task activation.

811,808,"Although abnonnalities in brain structures involved in the neurobiology of fear and anxiety have been implicated in the pathophysiology of panic disorder (PD), relatively few studies have made use of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine structural brain abnormalities in PD. We have assessed gray matter volume in 19 PD patients and 20 healthy volunteers using VBM. Images were acquired using a 1.5 T MRI scanner, and were spatially normalized and segmented using optimized VBM. Statistical comparisons were performed using the general linear model. A relative increase in gay matter volume was found in the left insula of PD patients compared with controls. Additional structures showing differential increases were the left superior temporal gyrus, the midbrain, and the pons. A relative gray matter deficit was found in the right anterior cingulate cortex. The insula and anterior cingulate abnormalities may be relevant to the pathophysiology of PD, since these structures participate in the evaluation process that ascribes negative emotional meaning to potentially distressing cognitive and interoceptive sensory information. The abnormal brain stem structures may be involved in the generation of panic attacks. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

812,809,"Marijuana is the most widely used illicit substance among teenagers, yet little is known about the possible neural influence of heavy marijuana use during adolescence. We previously demonstrated an altered functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity related to spatial working memory (SWM) among adolescents who were heavy users of after an average of 8 days of abstinence, but the persisting neural effects remain unclear. To characterize the potentially persisting neurocognitive effects of heavy marijuana use in adolescence, we examined fMRI response during SWM among abstinent marijuana-using teens. Participants were 15 MJ teens and 17 demographically similar non-using controls, ages 16-18. Teens underwent biweekly urine toxicology screens to ensure abstinence for 28 days before fMRI acquisition. Groups performed similarly on the SWM task, but MJ teens demonstrated lower activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal and occipital cortices, yet significantly more activation in right posterior parietal cortex. MJ teens showed abnormalities in brain response during a SWM task compared with controls, even after I month of abstinence. The activation pattern among MJ teens may reflect different patterns of utilization of spatial rehearsal and attention strategies, and could indicate altered neurodevelopment or persisting abnormalities associated with heavy marijuana use in adolescence.

813,810,"In this fMRI study, we show that an extended network of brain areas, previously described as the default-mode network, is suppressed during the performance of a global visual motion discrimination task. For the first time, we demonstrate that this network is transiently suppressed in an event-related fashion, reflecting a true negative activation compared to baseline, and that this deactivation occurs in a strongly graded fashion depending on the strength of the global motion signal. Deactivation across the network varied in an inverse linear relationship with motion coherency, demonstrating that the strongest suppression occurs for the most error-prone tasks. Deactivations were absent for the easiest of the tasks (100% coherence). We also show that the magnitude of task-related activation of the individual sub-components of the default-mode network are strongly correlated, indicating a highly integrated system. The results offer a striking indication of a rapid, highly reactive and tunable system within the brain for active suppression of this network of brain areas. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, a rapid and automatic alerting mechanism for responding to nonconscious signals of fear suggests that PTSD may display heightened rather than decreased MPFC under nonconscious processing of fear stimuli. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine blood oxygenation level-dependent signal changes during nonconscious presentation (16.7 ms, masked) of fearful and neutral faces in 15 participants with PTSD and 15 age and sex-matched healthy control participants. Results indicate that PTSD participants display increased amygdala and MPFC activity during nonconscious processing of fearful faces.

816,813,"Sexual activity involves excitement with high arousal and pleasure as typical features of emotions. Brain activations specifically related to erotic feelings and those related to general emotional processing are therefore hard to disentangle. Using fMRI in 21 healthy subjects ( 11 males and 10 females), we investigated regions that show activations specifically related to the viewing of sexually intense pictures while controlling for general emotional arousal (GEA) or pleasure. Activations in the ventral striatum and hypothalamus were found to be modulated by the stimulus' specific sexual intensity (SSI) while activations in the anterior cingulate cortex were associated with an interaction between sexual intensity and emotional valence. In contrast, activation in other regions like the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the mediodorsal thalamus and the amygdala was associated only with a general emotional component during sexual arousal. No differences were found in these effects when comparing females and males. Our findings demonstrate for the first time neural differentiation between emotional and sexual components in the neural network underlying sexual arousal. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The efficacy of the method is demonstrated with simulated sources and is also applied to real MEG data from a self-paced finger movement task. The algorithm reliably reveals modulations both in the beta band (12-30 Hz) and high gamma band (65-90 Hz) in sensorimotor cortex. The performance is validated by both across-subjects statistical comparisons and by intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) data from two epilepsy patients. Interestingly, we also reliably observed high frequency activity (30-300 Hz) in the cerebellum, although with variable locations and frequencies across subjects. The proposed algorithm is highly parallelizable and runs efficiently on modern high-performance computing clusters.

819,816,The thickness of the cerebral cortex can provide valuable information about normal and abnormal neuroanatomy. High resolution MRI together with powerful image processing techniques has made it possible to perform these measurements automatically over the whole brain. Here we present a method for automatically generating voxel-based cortical thickness (VBCT) maps. This technique results in maps where each voxel in the grey matter is assigned a thickness value. Sub-voxel measurements of thickness are possible using sub-sampling and interpolation of the image information. The method is applied to repeated MRI scans of a single subject from two MRI scanners to demonstrate its robustness and reproducibility. A simulated data set is used to show that small focal differences in thickness between two groups of subjects can be detected. We propose that the analysis of VBCT maps can provide results that are complementary to other anatomical analyses such as voxel-based morphometry. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, most functional MRI studies did not detect signal change in the primary somatosensory cortex during pain empathy. To test if the perception of pain in others involves the primary somatosensory cortex, neuromagnetic oscillatory activity was recorded from the primary somatosensory cortex in 16 participants while they observed static pictures depicting body parts in painful and non-painful situations. The left median nerve was stimulated at the wrist, and the poststimulus rebounds of the similar to 10-Hz somatosensory cortical oscillations were quantified. Compared to the baseline condition, the level of the similar to 10-Hz oscillations was suppressed during both of the observational situations, indicating the activation of the primary somatosensory cortex. Importantly, watching painful compared to non-painful situations suppressed somatosensory oscillations to a significant stronger degree. In addition, the suppression caused by perceiving others in the painful relative to the non-painful situations correlated with the perspective taking subscale of the interpersonal reaction index. These results, consistent with the mirror-neuron system, demonstrate that the perception of pain in others modulates neural activity in primary somatosensory cortex and supports the idea that the perception of pain in others elicits subtle somatosensory activity that may be difficult to detect by fMRI techniques.

821,818,"Proper singing requires the integration of auditory feedback mechanisms with the vocal motor system, such that vocal pitch can be precisely controlled. To determine the neural substrates involved in audio-vocal integration, non-musicians and experienced singers underwent fMRI scanning while they sang a single tone with either unaltered (""simple"") or pitch-shifted auditory feedback; in pitch-shifted trials, subjects were instructed either to ignore or compensate for the shifted feedback. We hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and anterior insula may be involved in audio-vocal integration due to their functional roles during singing and their anatomical connectivity. Although singers were more accurate than non-musicians in simple singing, both groups recruited similar functional networks. Singers ignored the shifted feedback better than non-musicians, and both groups also displayed different patterns of neural activity for this task: singers recruited bilateral auditory areas and left putamen, while non-musicians recruited the left supramarginal gyrus and primary motor cortex. While there were no significant group differences in performing the compensate task, singers displayed enhanced activity in the ACC, superior temporal sulcus, and putamen, whereas non-musicians exhibited increased activity in the dorsal premotor cortex, a region involved with sensorimotor interactions. We propose two neural substrates for audio-vocal integration: the dorsal premotor cortex may act as a basic interface, but with vocal training and practice, the ACC, auditory cortices, and putamen may be increasingly recruited as people learn to monitor their auditory feedback and adjust their vocal output accordingly.

822,819,"Moral judgment in the mature state depends on ""theory of mind"", or the capacity to attribute mental states (e. g., beliefs, desires, and intentions) to moral agents. The current study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the cognitive processes for belief attribution in moral judgment. Participants read vignettes in a 2 x 2 x 2 design: protagonists produced either a negative or neutral outcome, based on the belief that they were causing the negative outcome or the neutral outcome; presentation of belief information either preceded or followed outcome information. In each case, participants judged the moral permissibility of the action. The results indicate that while the medial prefrontal cortex is recruited for processing belief valence, the temporo-parietal junction and precuneus are recruited for processing beliefs in moral judgment via two distinct component processes: (1) encoding beliefs and (2) integrating beliefs with other relevant features of the action (e. g., the outcome) for moral judgment.

823,820,"Neuronal activity-induced changes in vascular tone and oxygen consumption result in a dynamic evolution of blood flow, volume, and oxygenation. Functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, optical imaging, and PET, provide indirect measures of the neural-induced vascular dynamics driving the blood parameters. Models connecting changes in vascular tone and oxygen consumption to observed changes in the blood parameters are needed to guide more quantitative physiological interpretation of these functional neuroimaging modalities. Effective lumped-parameter vascular balloon and Windkessel models have been developed for this purpose, but the lumping of the complex vascular network into a series of arterioles, capillaries, and venules allows only qualitative interpretation. We have therefore developed a parallel vascular anatomical network (VAN) model based on microscopically measurable properties to improve quantitative interpretation of the vascular response. The model, derived from measured physical properties, predicts baseline blood pressure and oxygen saturation distributions and dynamic responses consistent with literature. Furthermore, the VAN model allows investigation of spatial features of the dynamic vascular and oxygen response to neuronal activity.

824,821,"Major advances have been made in the understanding of the neurobiology of psychopathy in the past years, yet the distribution and extent of neuroanatomical abnormalities underlying the disorder are still poorly known. It is also unclear if different dimensions of the construct of psychopathy (e. g., emotional callousness, antisocial behavior) correspond to structural abnormalities in distinct regions of the brain. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) psychopathy is related to grey matter reductions in regions of the brain that underlie moral conduct and (2) the severity of psychopathy is related to the degree of structural abnormalities. Optimized voxel-based morphometry and the screening version of the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL: SV) were employed to investigate a matched sample of 15 community psychiatric patients with high PCL: SV scores, and 15 healthy normal volunteers. The analyses controlled for total grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Grey matter reductions were observed in the frontopolar, orbitofrontal and anterior temporal cortices, superior temporal sulcus region, and insula of the patients. The degree of structural abnormalities was significantly related to the interpersonal/affective dimension of psychopathy. The pattern of grey matter reductions in patients with high psychopathy scores comprised a distributed fronto-temporal network which plays a critical role in moral sensibility and behavior.

Multiple pediatric studies have reported reductions in the corpus callosum - the primary white matter tract in the brain. Consequently, in the present study, diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess white matter integrity in the corpus callosum in 17 maltreated children with PTSD and 15 demographically matched normal controls. Children with PTSD had reduced fractional anisotropy in the medial and posterior corpus, a region which contains interhemispheric projections from brain structures involved in circuits that mediate the processing of emotional stimuli and various memory functions - core disturbances associated with a history of trauma. Further exploration of the effects of stress on the corpus callosum and white matter development appears a promising strategy to better understand the pathophysiology of PTSD in children.

826,823,"Three-dimensional atlases and databases of the brain at different ages facilitate the description of neuroanatomy and the monitoring of cerebral growth and development. Brain segmentation is challenging in young children due to structural differences compared to adults. We have developed a method, based on established algorithms, for automatic segmentation of young children's brains into 83 regions of interest (ROIs), and applied this to an exemplar group of 33 2-year-old subjects who had been born prematurely. The algorithm uses prior information from 30 normal adult brain magnetic resonance (MR) images, which had been manually segmented to create 30 atlases, each labeling 83 anatomical structures. Each of these adult atlases was registered to each 2-year-old target MR image using non-rigid registration based on free-form deformations. Label propagation from each adult atlas yielded a segmentation of each 2-year-old brain into 83 ROIs. The final segmentation was obtained by combination of the 30 propagated adult atlases using decision fusion, improving accuracy over individual propagations. We validated this algorithm by comparing the automatic approach with three representative manually segmented volumetric regions (the subcortical caudate nucleus, the neocortical precentral gyros and the archicortical hippocampus) using similarity indices (SI), a measure of spatial overlap (intersection over average). SI results for automatic versus manual segmentations for these three structures were 0.90 +/- 0.01, 0.90 +/- 0.01 and 0.88 +/- 0.03 respectively. This registration approach allows the rapid construction of automatically labelled age-specific brain atlases for children at the age of 2 years. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

827,824,"Background: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) with hippocampus sclerosis (HS) is an important cause for focal epilepsy. In this study, we explored the integrity of connecting networks using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and two whole-brain voxel-based methods: statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Methods: Thirty-three consecutive patients with mTLE and HS undergoing presurgical evaluation were scanned at 3 T, a DTI data set was acquired and parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated. Twenty-one patients had left hippocampal sclerosis (LHS) and 12 patients had right HS (RHS). These groups were compared to 37 normal control subjects using both SPM5 and TBSS. Results: The ipsilateral temporal lobe showed widespread FA reduction in both groups. The limbic system was clearly abnormal in the LHS group, also involving the arcuate fasciculus. In RHS, changes were more restricted but also showed involvement of the contralateral temporal and inferior frontal lobe. Increased MD was found in the ipsilateral hippocampus by SPM that was only marginally detected by TBSS. In white matter regions, however, TBSS was more sensitive to changes than SPM. Conclusion: DT1 detects extensive changes in mTLE with HS. The affected networks were principally in the ipsilateral temporal lobe and the limbic system but also the arcuate fasciculus. SPM and TBSS gave complementary information with higher sensitivity to FA changes using TBSS. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

828,825,"Although motor imagery is widely used for motor learning in rehabilitation and sports training, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Based on fMRI data sets acquired with very high temporal resolution (300 ms) under motor execution and imagery conditions, we utilized Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to determine effective connectivity measures between supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1). A set of 28 models was tested in a Bayesian framework and the by-far best-performing model revealed a strong suppressive influence of the motor imagery condition on the forward connection between SMA and M1. Our results clearly indicate that the lack of activation in M1 during motor imagery is caused by suppression from the SMA. These results highlight the importance of the SMA not only for the preparation and execution of intended movements, but also for suppressing movements that are represented in the motor system but not to be performed.

829,826,"Wallerian degeneration plays a significant role in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Tracking the progression of Wallerian degeneration may provide better understanding of the evolution of many CNS diseases. In this study, a 28-day longitudinal in vivo DTI of optic nerve (ON) and optic tract (OT) was conducted to evaluate the temporal and spatial evolution of Wallerian degeneration resulting from the transient retinal ischemia. At 3-28 days after ischemia, ipsilateral ON and contralateral OT showed significant reduction in axial diffusivity (32-40% and 21-29% respectively) suggestive of axonal damage. Both ON and OT showed significant increase in radial diffusivity, 200-290% and 58-65% respectively, at 9-28 days suggestive of myelin damage. Immunohistochemistry of phosphorylated neurofilament (pNF) and myelin basic protein (MBP) was performed to assess axonal and myelin integrities validating the DTI findings. Both DTI and immunohistochemistry detected that transient retinal ischemia caused more severe damage to ON than to OT. The current results suggest that axial and radial diffusivities are capable of reflecting the severity of axonal and myelin damage in mice as assessed using immunohistochemistry.

830,827,"The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is upregulated on activated microglia and macrophages and thereby is a useful biomarker of inflammation. We developed a novel PET radioligand, [C-11]PBR28, that was able to image and quantify PBRs in healthy monkeys and in a rat model of stroke. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of [C-11]PBR28 to quantify PBRs in brain of healthy human subjects. Twelve subjects had PET scans of 120 to 180 min duration as well as serial sampling of arterial plasma to measure the concentration of unchanged parent radioligand. One- and two-tissue compartmental analyses were performed. To obtain stable estimates of distribution volume, which is a summation of B-max/K-D and nondisplaceable activity, 90 min of brain imaging was required. Distribution volumes in human were only similar to 5% of those in monkey. This comparatively low amount of receptor binding required a two-rather than a one-compartment model, suggesting that nonspecific binding was a sizeable percentage compared to specific binding. The time-activity curves in two of the twelve subjects appeared as if they had no PBR binding-i.e., rapid peak of uptake and fast washout from brain. The cause(s) of these unusual findings are unknown, but both subjects were also found to lack binding to PBRs in peripheral organs such as lung and kidney. In conclusion, with the exception of those subjects who appeared to have no PBR binding, [C-11] PBR28 is a promising ligand to quantify PBRs and localize inflammation associated with increased densities of PBRs.

832,829,"Fast, parallel word recognition, in expert readers, relies on sectors of the left ventral occipito-temporal pathway collectively known as the visual word form area. This expertise is thought to arise from perceptual learning mechanisms that extract informative features from the input strings. The perceptual expertise hypothesis leads to two predictions: (1) parallel word recognition, based on the ventral visual system, should be limited to words displayed in a familiar format (foveal horizontal words with normally spaced letters); (2) words displayed in formats outside this field of expertise should be read serially, under supervision of dorsal parietal attention systems. We presented adult readers with words that were progressively degraded in three different ways (word rotation, letter spacing, and displacement to the visual periphery). Behaviorally, we identified degradation thresholds above which reading difficulty increased non-linearly, with the concomitant emergence of a word length effect on reading latencies reflecting serial reading strategies. fMRI activations were correlated with reading difficulty in bilateral occipito-temporal and parietal regions, reflecting the strategies required to identify degraded words. A core region of the intraparietal cortex was engaged in all modes of degradation. Furthermore, in the ventral pathway, word degradation led to an amplification of activation in the posterior visual word form area, at a level thought to encode single letters. We also found an effect of word length restricted to highly degraded words in bilateral occipitoparietal regions. Those results clarify when and how the ventral parallel visual word form system needs to be supplemented by the deployment of dorsal serial reading strategies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This study addressed the functional neuroanatomy of this process and investigated whether it is modulated by temporal distance. Participants imagined positive and negative events pertaining to the near future or far future while their brain activity, was measured with fMRI. The results demonstrate that the anterior part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was more active in envisioning emotional events in the far future than in the near future, whereas the caudate nucleus was engaged in envisioning emotional (especially positive) situations in the near future. We argue that the anterior part of the vmPFC might assign emotional values to mental representations of future events that pertain to long-term goals. On the other hand, the caudate might support more concrete simulations of action plans to achieve rewarding situations in the near future. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

834,831,"Abnomalities of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, but structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies have reported variable findings. Reasons for this include a failure to consider variability in regional cortical folding patterns and a reliance on relatively coarse measures (e.g., volume) to index anatomical change. We sought to overcome these limitations by combining a novel protocol for parcellating the ACC and adjacent paracingulate cortex (PaC) that accounts for inter-individual variations in sulcal and gyrat morphology with a cortical surface-based approach that allowed calculation of regional grey matter volume, surface area and cortical thickness in 24 patients with bipolar I disorder and 24 matched controls. No changes in grey matter volume or surface area were identified in any region, but patients did show significant reductions in cortical thickness in the left rostral PaC and right dorsal PaC that were not attributable to group differences in cortical folding patterns. These findings suggest that bipolar disorder is associated with more pronounced changes in the PaC, and that reliance on volumetric measures alone may obscure more subtle differences.

835,832,"Animal models suggest that sucrose activates taste afferents differently than non-caloric sweeteners. Little information exists how artificial sweeteners engage central taste pathways in the human brain. We assessed sucrose and sucralose taste pleasantness across a concentration gradient in 12 healthy control women and applied 10% sucrose and matched sucralose during functional magnet resonance imaging. The results indicate that (1) both sucrose and sucralose activate functionally connected primary taste pathways; (2) taste pleasantness predicts left insula response; (3) sucrose elicits a stronger brain response in the anterior insula, frontal operculum, striaturn and anterior cingulate, compared to sucralose; (4) only sucrose, but not sucralose, stimulation engages dopaminergic midbrain areas in relation to the behavioral pleasantness response. Thus, brain response distinguishes the caloric from the non-caloric sweetener, although the conscious mind could not. This could have important implications on how effective artificial sweeteners are in their ability to substitute sugar intake. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

837,834,"In recent years, the use of beamformers for source localisation has significantly improved the spatial accuracy of magnetoencephalography. In this paper, we examine techniques by which to optimise experimental design, and ensure that the application of beamformers yields accurate results. We show that variation in the experimental duration, or variation in the bandwidth of a signal of interest, can significantly affect the accuracy of a beamformer reconstruction of source power. Specifically, power will usually be underestimated if covariance windows are made too short, or bandwidths too narrow. The accuracy of spatial localisation may also be reduced. We conclude that for optimum accuracy, experimenters should aim to collect as much data as possible, and use a bandwidth spanning the entire frequency distribution of the signal of interest. This minimises distortion to reconstructed source images, time courses and power estimation. In the case where experimental duration is short, and small covariance windows are therefore used, we show that accurate power estimation can be achieved by matrix regularisation. However, large amounts of regularisation cause a loss in the spatial resolution of the MEG beamformer, hence regularisation should be used carefully, particularly if multiple sources in close proximity are expected.

838,835,"Gastric distention during meal ingestion activates vagal afferents, which send signals from the stomach to the brain and result in the perception of fullness and satiety. Distention is one of the mechanisms that modulates food intake. We measured regional brain activation during dynamic gastric balloon distention in 18 health subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging and the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses. The BOLD signal was significantly changed by both inflow and outflow changes in the balloon's volume. For lower balloon volumes, water inflow was associated with activation of sensorimotor cortices and right insula. The larger volume condition additionally activated left posterior amygdala, left posterior insula and the left precuneus. The response in the left amygdala and insula was negatively associated with changes in self-reports of fullness and positively with changes in plasma ghrelin concentration, whereas those in the right amygdala and insula were negatively associated with the subject's body mass index. The widespread activation induced by gastric distention corroborates the influence of vagal afferents on cortical and subcortical brain activity. These findings provide evidence that the left amygdala and insula process interoceptive signals of fullness produced by gastric distention involved in the controls of food intake.

839,836,"The pathophysiology of generalized spike wave discharges (GSW) is not completely understood. Thalamus, basal ganglia and neocortex have been implicated in the generation of GSW, yet the specific role of each structure remains to be clarified. in six children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), we performed combined EEG-fMRI to identify GSW-related changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the striato-thalamo-cortical network. In all patients, within-subject analysis demonstrated BOLD signal changes that preceded the GSW. An increase in BOLD signal in the medial thalamus started 6 s before the onset of the GSW. Decreases in cortical BOLD signal were mainly found in frontoparietal areas and precuneus starting 6 to 3 s before the GSW. All patients showed a decrease in BOLD signal in the head of the caudate nucleus with a variable onset. The temporospatial pattern of BOLD signal changes suggests that GSW on the cortical surface is preceded by a sequence of neuronal events in the thalamo-cortical-striatal network. Approximately 6 s before the GSW, the thalamus shows an increase in neuronal activity along with regional decreases in cortical activity. These changes in thalamo-cortical activity are followed by a deactivation of the caudate nucleus. These early changes in BOLD signal may reflect changes in neuronal activity that contribute to the generation of GSW and may contribute to the transition from a normal to a generalized hyper-synchronous pattern of neuronal activity.

839,836,"The pathophysiology of generalized spike wave discharges (GSW) is not completely understood. Thalamus, basal ganglia and neocortex have been implicated in the generation of GSW, yet the specific role of each structure remains to be clarified. in six children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), we performed combined EEG-fMRI to identify GSW-related changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the striato-thalamo-cortical network. In all patients, within-subject analysis demonstrated BOLD signal changes that preceded the GSW. An increase in BOLD signal in the medial thalamus started 6 s before the onset of the GSW. Decreases in cortical BOLD signal were mainly found in frontoparietal areas and precuneus starting 6 to 3 s before the GSW. All patients showed a decrease in BOLD signal in the head of the caudate nucleus with a variable onset. The temporospatial pattern of BOLD signal changes suggests that GSW on the cortical surface is preceded by a sequence of neuronal events in the thalamo-cortical-striatal network. Approximately 6 s before the GSW, the thalamus shows an increase in neuronal activity along with regional decreases in cortical activity. These changes in thalamo-cortical activity are followed by a deactivation of the caudate nucleus.

840,837,"The mirror neuron system (MNS) has been proposed to play an important role in social cognition by providing a neural mechanism by which others' actions, intentions, and emotions can be understood. Here functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to directly examine the relationship between MNS activity and two distinct indicators of social functioning in typically-developing children (aged 10.1 years +/- 7 months): empathy and interpersonal competence. Reliable activity in pars opercularis, the frontal component of the MNS, was elicited by observation and imitation of emotional expressions. Importantly, activity in this region (as well as in the anterior insula and amygdala) was significantly and positively correlated with established behavioral measures indexing children's empathic behavior (during both imitation and observation) and interpersonal skills (during imitation only). These findings suggest that simulation mechanisms and the MNS may indeed be relevant to social functioning in everyday life during typical human development. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

On the other hand, it remains unclear whether or not the potential confound introduced by different scanners and upgrades will devalue the integrity of any results. Although there are studies of scanner differences for the purpose of calibration and quality control, the current literature is devoid of studies that describe the analysis of multi-scanner data with regard to the interaction of scanner(s) with effects of interest. We investigated a data-set of 136 subjects, 62 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and 74 cognitively normal elderly controls, with MRI scans from one center that were acquired over 10 years with 6 different scanners and multiple upgrades over time. We used a whole-brain voxel-wise analysis to evaluate the effect of scanner, effect of disease, and the interaction of scanner and disease for the 6 different scanners. The effect of disease in patients showed the expected significant reduction of grey matter in the medial temporal lobe. Scanner differences were substantially less than the group differences and only significant in the thalamus. There was no significant interaction of scanner with disease group. We describe the rationale for concluding that our results were not confounded by scanner differences. Similar analyses in other multi-scanner data-sets could be used to justify the pooling of data when needed, such as in studies of rare disorders or in multi-center designs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

843,840,"Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals in functional magnetic resonance imaging (tMRI) are often small compared to the level of noise in the data. The sources of noise are numerous including different kinds of motion artifacts and physiological noise with complex patterns. This complicates the statistical analysis of the fMRI data. In this study, we propose an automatic method to reduce fMRI artifacts based on independent component analysis (ICA). We trained a supervised classifier to distinguish between independent components relating to a potentially task-related signal and independent components clearly relating to structured noise. After the components had been classified as either signal or noise, a denoised fMR time-series was reconstructed based only on the independent components classified as potentially task-related. The classifier was a novel global (fixed structure) decision tree trained in a Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework, which allowed the shape of the decision regions to be controlled effectively. Additionally, the conservativeness of the classifier could be tuned by modifying the NP threshold. The classifier was tested against the component classifications by an expert with the data from a category learning task. The test set as well as the expert were different from the data used for classifier training and the expert labeling the training set. The misclassification rate was between 0.2 and 0.3 for both the event-related and blocked designs and it was consistent among variety of different NP thresholds. The effects of denoising on the group-level statistical analyses were as expected: The denoising generally decreased Z-scores in the white matter, where extreme Z-values can be expected to reflect artifacts. A similar but weaker decrease in Z-scores was observed in the gray matter on average. These two observations suggest that denoising was likely to reduce artifacts from gray matter and could be useful to improve the detection of activations. We conclude that automatic ICA-based denoising offers a potentially useful approach to improve the quality of fMRI data and consequently increase the accuracy of the statistical analysis of these data.

844,841,"Stuttering is a developmental speech disorder that occurs in 5% of children with spontaneous remission in approximately 70% of cases. Previous imaging studies in adults with persistent stuttering found left white matter deficiencies and reversed right-left asymmetries compared to fluent controls. We hypothesized that similar differences might be present indicating brain development differences in children at risk of stuttering. Optimized voxel-based morphometry compared gray matter volume (GMV) and diffusion tensor imaging measured fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter tracts in 3 groups: children with persistent stuttering, children recovered from stuttering, and fluent peers. Both the persistent stuttering and recovered groups had reduced GMV from normal in speech-relevant regions: the left inferior frontal gyros and bilateral temporal regions. Reduced FA was found in the left white matter tracts underlying the motor regions for face and larynx in the persistent stuttering group. Contrary to previous findings in adults who stutter, no increases were found in the right hemisphere speech regions in stuttering or recovered children and no differences in right-left asymmetries. Instead, a risk for childhood stuttering was associated with deficiencies in left gray matter volume while reduced white matter integrity in the left hemisphere speech system was associated with persistent stuttering. Anatomical increases in right hemisphere structures previously found in adults who stutter may have resulted from a lifetime of stuttering. These findings point to the importance of considering the role of neuroplasticity during development when studying persistent forms of developmental disorders in adults. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated the association between age, gender, and the global and regional fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 145 adults (30 to 80 years old) using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. We studied sixteen regions of interest in both hemispheres to search for regions that display age- and gender-related white matter changes and also performed a complementary voxel-based analysis without any hypothesis a priori. On a global scale, our results indicate that the full brain FA was negatively correlated with age. The regional analysis showed that the anterior corpus callosum, the bilateral anterior and posterior internal capsule, and the posterior periventricular regions had the most significant age-related FA decrease. On the other hand, the FA in the temporal and occipital regions was not correlated with age. However, in contrast to males, females overall had a significantly lower FA in the right deep temporal regions. More gender differences in precentral, cingulate, and anterior temporal white matter areas were also found, suggesting that microstructural white matter organization in these regions may have a sexual dimorphism. Such differences were mainly due to the increase in diffusion perpendicular to fiber tracts. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

846,843,"Semantic dementia (SD) is a rare clinical syndrome, assigned to the group of frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD). Histopathological analysis has not revealed the deposition of amyloid plaques in the majority of SD cases, in contrast to dementia of the Alzheimer type (AD). However, based on clinical examination alone a reliable differentiation of the underlying pathology cannot be guaranteed, i.e. AD and SD may be confused in some cases. Our aim was to determine, whether AD and SD can be differentiated in vivo by means of amyloid plaque PET imaging. In groups of AD and SD patients, matched for gender, age and overall degree of cognitive impairment, cerebral glucose metabolism was examined with [F-18]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and cerebral amyloid plaque density was assessed using [C-11]6-OH-BTA-1 (PIB)-PET. A volume-of-interest analysis (VOI), using the cerebellum as a reference region, and voxel-based statistical group comparisons (SPM2) were carried out between the patient groups and matched groups of healthy controls. To control for a potential influence of atrophy on the PET findings, a correction of partial volume effects was performed. Characteristic patterns of hypometabolism could be demonstrated in both clinically defined AD and SD with some regional overlap and subtle differences (AD: bilateral posterior cingulate, temporoparietal and frontal cortex; SD: left>right polar temporal, frontal mesial cortex). Compared with healthy controls, significant [C-11]PIB amyloid plaque tracer binding was observed only in patients with AD (in bilateral temporoparietal, frontal and posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus) but not in SD. This difference in amyloid plaque deposition could be reproduced in direct statistical comparison of AD and SD and clearly extended the metabolic differences between the patient groups. These findings support the notion that SD can be diagnosed in vivo as a separate entity from AD using amyloid plaque imaging. In general, amyloid plaque PET may complement neuropsychological assessment regarding reliable differential diagnosis of AD and FTLD dementias based on characterization of underlying pathology and may improve the definition of individual prognosis and the selection of patients for scientific trials.

847,844,"An erect posture with bipedal locomotion is a characteristic feature of humans compared to other mammals. Most of our knowledge about the hierarchical network of supraspinal locomotor centers derives from animal experiments, mainly in the cat. We posed the question of whether evolutionary transition from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion - with associated change of foreleg function - caused reorganization of these supraspinal locomotor centers. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified separate and distinct cerebellar and brainstem BOLD signal increases related to posture and gait during mental imagery of standing, walking, and running in healthy volunteers (n = 26). Comparison with the locomotion centers in the cat showed that these activations include the pacemakers for gait initiation and speed regulation in the interfastigial cerebellum and bilateral midbrain tegmentum (cerebellar and mesencephalic locomotor regions), their descending target regions in the pontine reticular formation, and the rhythm generators in the cerebellar vermis and paravermal cortex. Moreover, during mental imagery of stance, a BOLD signal increase was observed in the dorsal pons, reflecting an activation of the dorsal tegmental field, a locomotion-suppressing site in the cat. These results support the view that the organization of supraspinal locomotor centers was preserved during the transition to bipedal locomotion. The clinical relevance of these centers has so far been largely neglected. However, Parkinson's disease, for example, is associated with reduced cell counts in the pedunculopontine nucleus, a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region. This association suggests that deep brain stimulation of locomotion centers may provide new therapeutic approaches for common gait disorders. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

848,845,"The symptom-provocation paradigms generally used in neuroimaging studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have placed high demands on emotion processing but lacked cognitive processing, thereby limiting the ability to assess alterations in neural systems that subserve executive functions and their interactions with emotion processing. Thirty-nine veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while exposed to emotional combat-related and neutral civilian scenes interleaved with an executive processing task. Contrast activation maps were regressed against PTSD symptoms as measured by the Davidson Trauma Scale. Activation for emotional compared with neutral stimuli was highly positively correlated with level of PTSD symptoms in ventral frontolimbic regions, notably the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and ventral anterior cingulate gyrus. Conversely, activation for the executive task was negatively correlated with PTSD symptoms in the dorsal executive network, notably the middle frontal gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule. Thus, there is a strong link between the subjectively assessed behavioral phenomenology of PTSD and objective neurobiological markers. These findings extend the largely symptom provocation-based functional neuroanatomy to provide evidence that interrelated executive and emotional processing systems of the brain are differentially affected by PTSD symptomatology in recently deployed war veterans.

849,846,"Background: Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) val(108/158) met (rs4680) is thought to affect dopamine regulated prefrontal cortical activity during working memory (WM) tasks, and to weakly increase risk for developing schizophrenia. Recently, other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the gene have emerged as additional risk factors for schizophrenia: namely rs737865, rs165599, and rs2097603. In a large sample, we examined whether these SNPs affect WM. Methods: Schizophrenic probands (n = 325), their nonpsychotic siblings (n = 359), and normal control subjects (n = 330) completed tests of WM function. Data were analyzed with a series of mixed model analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Results: Val homozygotes performed most poorly on all conditions of the n-back, irrespective of diagnosis. Additionally, there was a trend towards a disease-only val(108/158) met effect on a test of attentional set-shifting; val homozygote probands performed most poorly. Significant or near-significant effects of rs737865 were found on all conditions of the n-back, with G homozygotes performing worst. There also was a disease-only COMT rs737865 effect on the 0-back. None of the other SNPs showed main effects by themselves. A haplotype constructed from promoter and val(108/158)met SNPs showed main effects on WM parameters, consistent with inverted U models of doparmine signaling. Conclusions: We extended earlier findings of a val(108/158)met effect on WM function, and suggest that combinations of alleles within COMT may modulate the val(108/158). met effect in a nonlinear manner.","Genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase: Effects on working memory in schizophrenic patients, their siblings, and healthy controls",2008,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY,Article,17707347,['nomethod'],1.672025723,nomethod
850,847,"In normal humans, relationships between cognitive test performance and cortical structure have received little study, in part, because of the paucity of tools for measuring cortical structure. Computational morphometric methods have recently been developed that enable the measurement of cortical thickness from MRI data, but little data exist on their reliability. We undertook this study to evaluate the reliability of an automated cortical thickness measurement method to detect correlates of interest between thickness and cognitive task performance. Fifteen healthy older participants were scanned four times at 2-week intervals on three different scanner platforms. The four MRI data sets were initially treated independently to investigate the reliability of the spatial localization of findings from exploratory whole-cortex analyses of cortical thickness-cognitive performance correlates. Next, the first data set was used to define cortical Rolls based on the exploratory results that were then applied to the remaining three data sets to determine whether the relationships between cognitive performance and regional cortical thickness were comparable across different scanner platforms and field strengths. Verbal memory performance was associated with medial temporal cortical thickness, while visuomotor speed/set shifting was associated with lateral parietal cortical thickness. These effects were highly reliable - in terms of both spatial localization and magnitude of absolute cortical thickness measurements - across the four scan sessions. Brain-behavior relationships between regional cortical thickness and cognitive task performance can be reliably identified using an automated data analysis system, suggesting that these measures may be useful as imaging biomarkers of disease or performance ability in multicenter studies in which MRI data are pooled.

852,849,"This paper introduces a multivariate Bayesian (MVB) scheme to decode or recognise brain states from neuroimages. It resolves the ill-posed many-to-one mapping, from voxel values or data features to a target variable, using a parametric empirical or hierarchical Bayesian model. This model is inverted using standard variational techniques, in this case expectation maximisation, to furnish the model evidence and the conditional density of the model's parameters. This allows one to compare different models or hypotheses about the mapping from functional or structural anatomy to perceptual and behavioural consequences (or their deficits). We frame this approach in terms of decoding measured brain states to predict or classify outcomes using the rhetoric established in pattern classification of neuroimaging data. However, the aim of MVB is not to predict (because the outcomes are known) but to enable inference on different models of structure-function mappings; such as distributed and sparse representations. This allows one to optimise the model itself and produce predictions that outperform standard pattern classification approaches, like support vector machines. Technically, the model inversion and inference uses the same empirical Bayesian procedures developed for ill-posed inverse problems (e.g., source reconstruction in EEG). However, the MVB scheme used here extends this approach to include a greedy search for sparse solutions. It reduces the problem to the same form used in Gaussian process modelling, which affords a generic and efficient scheme for model optimisation and evaluating model evidence. We illustrate MVB using simulated and real data, with a special focus on model comparison; where models can differ in the form of the mapping (i.e., neuronal representation) within one region, or in the (combination of) regions per se.

This measure is based on previous formulas for the mutual information (MI) between clusters of regions in the frequency domain. Under the current scenario, the MI can be given as a simple monotonous function of the multiple coherence and it leads to an easy visual representation of connectivity patterns. Computationally efficient formulas, adequate for short time series, are presented and applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data measured in subjects (N=34) performing a working memory task or being at rest. While resting state coherence in high (0.17-0.25 Hz) and middle (0.08-0.17 Hz) frequency intervals is bilaterally salient in several limbic and temporal areas including the insula, the amygdala, and the primary auditory cortex, low frequencies (<0.08 Hz) have greatest connectivity in frontal structures. Results from the comparison between resting and N-back conditions show enhanced low frequency coherence in many of the areas previously reported in standard fMRI activation studies of working memory, but task related reductions in high frequency connectivity are also found in regions of the default mode network.

Under the current scenario, the MI can be given as a simple monotonous function of the multiple coherence and it leads to an easy visual representation of connectivity patterns. Computationally efficient formulas, adequate for short time series, are presented and applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data measured in subjects (N=34) performing a working memory task or being at rest. While resting state coherence in high (0.17-0.25 Hz) and middle (0.08-0.17 Hz) frequency intervals is bilaterally salient in several limbic and temporal areas including the insula, the amygdala, and the primary auditory cortex, low frequencies (<0.08 Hz) have greatest connectivity in frontal structures. Results from the comparison between resting and N-back conditions show enhanced low frequency coherence in many of the areas previously reported in standard fMRI activation studies of working memory, but task related reductions in high frequency connectivity are also found in regions of the default mode network. Finally, potentially confounding effects of head movement and regional volume on MI are identified and addressed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

855,852,"Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a specific learning disability affecting the normal acquisition of arithmetic skills. Current studies estimate that 3-6% of the school population is affected by DD. Genetic, neurobiological, and epidemiologic evidence indicates that dyscalculia is a brain-based disorder. Imaging studies suggest the involvement of parietal and prefrontal cortices in arithmetic tasks. The aim of the present study was to analyze if children with DD show structural differences in parietal, frontal, and cingulate areas compared to typically achieving children. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained from 12 children with DD aged 9.3 +/- 0.2 years and 12 age-matched control children without any learning disabilities on a 1.5 T whole-body scanner. Voxel-based morphometry analysis with an optimization of spatial segmentation and normalization procedures was applied to compare the two groups in order to rind differences in cerebral gray and white matter. Compared to controls, children with DD show significantly reduced gray matter volume in the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the anterior cingulum, the left inferior frontal gyros, and the bilateral middle frontal gyri. White matter comparison demonstrates clusters with significantly less volume in the left frontal lobe and in the right parahippocampal gyros in dyscalculic children. The decreased gray and white matter volumes in the frontoparietal network might be the neurological substrate of impaired arithmetic processing skills. The white matter volume decrease in parahippocampal areas may have influence on fact retrieval and spatial memory processing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In an event-related FMRI experiment, we independently manipulated valence and salience by cuing participants to anticipate certain and uncertain monetary gains and losses. NAcc activation correlated with both valence and salience. On trials with certain outcomes, NAcc activation increased for anticipated gains and decreased for anticipated losses. On trials with uncertain outcomes, NAcc activation increased for both anticipated gains and losses but did not differ between them. These findings suggest that NAcc activation separately represents both valence and salience, consistent with its hypothesized role in appetitive motivation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The SST involves a go task and the occasional requirement to stop the go response. We posit that both the go and the stop phases of the SST involve components of inhibition and performance monitoring. The goal of this study was to determine whether inhibition and performance monitoring during go and stop phases of the task activated different networks. We isolated go-phase activities underlying response withholding, monitoring, and sensorimotor processing and contrasted these with successful inhibition to identify the substrate of response inhibition. Error detection activity was isolated using trials in which a stop signal appeared but the response was executed. These trials were modeled as a hand-specific go trial followed by error processing. Cognitive go-phase processes included response withholding and monitoring and activated right prefrontal and midline networks. Response withdrawal additionally activated right inferior frontal gyrus and basal ganglia (caudate). Error detection invoked by failed inhibition activated dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right middle frontal Brodmann's area 9.

859,856,"The classical model of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses by Buxton et al. [Buxton, R.B., Wong, E.C., Frank, L.R., 1998. Dynamics of blood flow and oxygenation changes during brain activation: the Balloon model. Magn. Reson. Med. 39, 855-864] has been very important in providing a biophysically plausible framework for explaining different aspects of hemodynamic responses. It also plays an important role in the hemodynamic forward model for dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of fMRI data. A recent study by Obata et al. [Obata, T., Liu, T.T., Miller, K.L., Luh, W.M., Wong, E.C., Frank, L.R., Buxton, R.B., 2004. Discrepancies between BOLD and flow dynamics in primary and supplementary motor areas: application of the Balloon model to the interpretation of BOLD transients. NeuroImage 21, 144-153] linearized the BOLD signal equation and suggested a revised form for the model coefficients. In this paper, we show that the classical and revised models are special cases of a generalized model. The BOLD signal equation of this generalized model can be reduced to that of the classical Buxton model by simplifying the coefficients or can be linearized to give the Obata model. Given the importance of hemodynamic models for investigating BOLD responses and analyses of effective connectivity with DCM, the question arises which formulation is the best model for empirically measured BOLD responses. In this article, we address this question by embedding different variants of the BOLD signal equation in a well-established DCM of functional interactions among visual areas. This allows us to compare the ensuing models using Bayesian model selection. Our model comparison approach had a factorial structure, comparing eight different hemodynamic models based on (i) classical vs. revised forms for the coefficients, (ii) linear vs. nonlinear output equations, and (iii) fixed vs. free parameters, e, for region-specific ratios of intra- and extravascular signals. Using fMRI data from a group of twelve subjects, we demonstrate that the best model is a non-linear model with a revised form for the coefficients, in which e is treated as a free parameter.

860,857,"White matter (WM) abnormalities in schizophrenia may offer important clues to a better understanding of the disconnectivity associated with the disorder. The aim of this study was to elucidate a WM basis of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia through the simultaneous investigation of WM tract integrity and WM density. Diffusion tensor images (DTIs) and structural T1 magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were taken from 15 hallucinating schizophrenic patients, 15 non-hallucinating schizophrenic patients and 22 normal controls. Voxel-based analyses and post-hoc region of interest analyses were obtained to compare the three groups on fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from DTI as well as WM density derived from structural MRIs. In both the hallucinating and non-hallucinating groups, FA of the WM regions was significantly decreased in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), whereas WM density was significantly increased in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). The mean FA value of the left frontal part of the SLF was positively correlated with the severity score of auditory hallucinations in the hallucinating patient group. Our findings show that WM changes were mainly observed in the frontal and temporal areas, suggesting that disconnectivity in the left fronto-temporal area may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In addition, pathologic WM changes in this region may be an important step in the development of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

861,858,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving dysmaturation of widely distributed brain systems. Accordingly, behaviors that depend on distributed systems, such as higher level cognition and sensorimotor control, are compromised in the disorder. The current study investigated alterations in neural systems underlying sensorimotor disturbances in autism. An fMRI investigation was conducted using saccadic and. pursuit eye movement paradigms with 13 high functioning individuals with autism and 14 age- and IQ-matched typically developing individuals. Individuals with autism had reduced activation in cortical eye fields and cerebellar hemispheres during both eye movement tasks. When executing visually guided saccades, individuals with autism had greater activation bilaterally in a frontostriatal circuit including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, medial thalamus, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, and right dentate nucleus. The increased activation in prefrontal-striatal-thalamocortical circuitry during visually guided saccades indicates that systems typically dedicated to cognitive control may need to compensate for disturbances in lower-level sensorimotor systems. Reduced activation throughout visual sensorimotor systems may contribute to saccadic and pursuit disturbances that have been reported in autism. These findings document that neurodevelopmental disturbances in autism affect widely distributed brain systems beyond those mediating language and social cognition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

862,859,"Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed that parietal brain circuits subserve arithmetic problem solving and that their recruitment dynamically changes as a function of training and development. The present study investigated whether the brain activation during mental calculation is also modulated by individual differences in mathematical competence. Twenty-five adult students were selected from a larger pool based on their performance on standardized tests of intelligence and arithmetic and divided into groups of individuals with relatively lower and higher mathematical competence. These groups did not differ in their non-numerical intelligence or age. In an fMRI block-design, participants had to verify the correctness of single-digit and multi-digit multiplication problems. Analyses revealed that the individuals with higher mathematical competence displayed stronger activation of the left angular gyrus while solving both types of arithmetic problems. Additional correlational analyses corroborated the association between individual differences in mathematical competence and angular gyrus activation, even when variability in task performance was controlled for. These findings demonstrate that the recruitment of the left angular gyrus during arithmetic problem solving underlies individual differences in mathematical ability and suggests a stronger reliance on automatic, language-mediated processes in more competent individuals.

We. applied principal component analysis to deformation maps derived from MRI scans of 32 AD patients, 18 elderly healthy controls and 24 MCI patients. Principal component scores were used to discriminate between AD patients and controls and between MCI converters and MCI non-converters. We found a significant regional pattern of atrophy (p < 0.001) in medial temporal lobes, neocortical association areas, thalamus and basal ganglia and corresponding widening of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces (p < 0.001) in AD patients compared to controls. Accuracy was 81% for CSF- and 83% for brainbased deformation maps to separate AD patients from controls. Nine out of 24 MCI patients converted to AD during clinical follow-up. Discrimination between MCI converters and non-converters reached 80% accuracy based on CSF maps and 73% accuracy based on brain maps. In a logistic regression model, principal component scores based on CSF maps predicted clinical outcome in MCI patients even after controlling for age, gender, MMSE score and time of follow-up. Our findings indicate that multivariate network analysis of deformation maps detects typical features of AD pathology and provides a powerful tool to predict conversion into AD in non-demented at risk patients.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we explored brain activation in subjects with spider phobia and in non-phobic subjects, while participants anticipated the presentation of either neutral or phobogenic visual stimuli. Subjective ratings indicated that anticipation of phobia-related stimuli was associated with increased anxiety in phobics but not in healthy subjects. FMRI results showed increased activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, thalamus, and visual areas in phobics compared to controls during anticipation of phobia-relevant versus anticipation of neutral stimulation. Furthermore, for this contrast, we found also increased activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). This particular finding supports models, which propose, based on animal experiments, a critical involvement of the BNST in anticipatory anxiety. Finally, correlation analysis revealed that subjective anxiety of phobics correlated significantly with activation in rostral and dorsal ACC and the anterior medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, activation in different ACC regions and the medial prefrontal cortex seems to be specifically associated with the severity of experienced anticipatory anxiety in subjects with spider phobia.

Genotypes for COMT and DAT were determined in a sample of 75 healthy subjects, who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an N-back task. To further assess the effects of the genotypes on cognition, subjects were administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Analysis of fMRI data revealed an additive effect of these two genes on brain activation in an N-back task, with subjects homozygous for the Val and the 9-repeat alleles showing the highest activation for the same level of performance. Moreover, the Val allele was related to higher number of perseverative errors on the WCST and with a higher number of commission errors on the CPT.

871,868,"In a natural environment, non-verbal emotional communication is multimodal (i.e. speech melody, facial expression) and multifaceted concerning the variety of expressed emotions. Understanding these communicative signals and integrating them into a common percept is paramount to successful social behaviour. While many previous studies have focused on the neurobiology of emotional communication in the auditory or visual modality alone, far less is known about multimodal integration of auditory and visual non-verbal emotional information. The present study investigated this process using event-related fMRI. Behavioural data revealed that audiovisual presentation of non-verbal emotional information resulted in a significant increase in correctly classified stimuli when compared with visual and auditory stimulation. This behavioural gain was paralleled by enhanced activation in bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and right thalamus, when contrasting audiovisual to auditory and visual conditions. Further, a characteristic of these brain regions, substantiating their role in the emotional integration process, is a linear relationship between the gain in classification accuracy and the strength of the BOLD response during the bimodal condition. Additionally, enhanced effective connectivity between audiovisual integration areas and associative auditory and visual cortices was observed during audiovisual stimulation, offering further insight into the neural process accomplishing multimodal integration. Finally, we were able to document an enhanced sensitivity of the putative integration sites to stimuli with emotional non-verbal content as compared to neutral stimuli. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

872,869,"Speakers use external auditory feedback to monitor their own speech. Feedback distortion has been found to increase activity in the superior temporal areas. Using fMR1, the present study investigates the neural correlates of processing verbal feedback without distortion. In a blocked design, the following conditions were presented: (1) overt picture-naming, (2) overt picture-naming while pink noise was presented to mask external feedback, (3) covert picture-naming, (4) listening to the picture names (previously recorded from participants' own voices), and (5) listening to pink noise. The results show that auditory feedback processing involves a network of different areas related to general performance monitoring and speech-motor control. These include the cingulate cortex and the bilateral insula, supplementary motor area, bilateral motor areas, cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia. Our findings suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex, which is often implicated in error-processing and conflict-monitoring, is also engaged in ongoing speech monitoring. Furthermore, in the superior temporal gyrus, we found a reduced response to speaking under normal feedback conditions. This finding is interpreted in the framework of a forward model according to which, during speech production, the sensory consequence of the speech-motor act is predicted to attenuate the sensitivity of the auditory cortex.

DBS of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is emerging as a promising surgical therapy for PD as well. In order to better characterize these nuclei in humans, we determined the anatomical connections of the PPN and STN and the topography of these connections using probabilistic diffusion tractography. Diffusion tractography was carried out in eight healthy adult subjects using diffusion data acquired at 1.5 T MRI (60 directions, b=1000 S/MM2, 2x2x2 MM3 voxels). The major connections that we identified from single seed voxels within STN or PPN were present in at least half the subjects and the topography of these connections within a 36-voxel region surrounding the initial seed voxel was then examined. Both the PPN and STN showed connections with the cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and down the spinal cord, largely matching connections demonstrated in primates. The topography of motor and associative brain areas in the human STN was strikingly similar to that shown in animals. PPN Topography has not been extensively demonstrated in animals, but we showed significant topography of cortical and subcortical connections in the human PPN.

873,870,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) ofthe subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most common surgical therapy for Parkinson' s disease (PD). DBS of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is emerging as a promising surgical therapy for PD as well. In order to better characterize these nuclei in humans, we determined the anatomical connections of the PPN and STN and the topography of these connections using probabilistic diffusion tractography. Diffusion tractography was carried out in eight healthy adult subjects using diffusion data acquired at 1.5 T MRI (60 directions, b=1000 S/MM2, 2x2x2 MM3 voxels). The major connections that we identified from single seed voxels within STN or PPN were present in at least half the subjects and the topography of these connections within a 36-voxel region surrounding the initial seed voxel was then examined. Both the PPN and STN showed connections with the cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and down the spinal cord, largely matching connections demonstrated in primates. The topography of motor and associative brain areas in the human STN was strikingly similar to that shown in animals. PPN Topography has not been extensively demonstrated in animals, but we showed significant topography of cortical and subcortical connections in the human PPN. In addition to demonstrating the usefulness ofPDT in determining the connections and topography of small grey matter structures in vivo, these results allow for inference of optimal DBS target locations and add to our understanding of the role of these nuclei in PD.

874,871,"A key component of group analyses of neuroimaging data is precise and valid spatial normalization (i.e., inter-subject image registration). When patients have structural brain lesions, such as a stroke, this process can be confounded by the lack of correspondence between the subject and standardized template images. Current procedures for dealing with this problem include regularizing the estimate of warping parameters used to match lesioned brains to the template, or ""cost function masking""; both these solutions have significant drawbacks. We report three experiments that identify the best spatial normalization for structurally damaged brains and establish whether differences among normalizations have a significant effect on inferences about functional activations. Our novel protocols evaluate the effects of different normalization solutions and can be applied easily to any neuroiniaging study. This has important implications for users of both structural and functional imaging techniques in the study of patients with structural brain damage. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

875,872,"Cocaine affects sensory perception and attention, but little is known about the neural substrates underlying these effects in the human brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a sustained visuospatial attention task to assess if the visual attention network is dysfunctional in cocaine abusers (n = 14) compared to age-, gender-, and education-matched controls (n= 14). Compared with controls, cocaine abusers showed (1) hypo-activation of the thalamus, which may reflect noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic deficits; (2) hyper-activation in occipital and prefrontal cortices, which may reflect increased visual cortical processing to compensate for inefficient visual thalamic processing; and (3) larger deactivation of parietal and frontal regions possibly to support the larger hemodynamic supply to the hyper-activated brain regions. These findings provide evidence of abnormalities in thalamo-cortical responses in cocaine abusers that are likely to contribute to the impairments in sensory processing and in attention. The development of therapies that diminish these thalamo-cortical deficits could improve the treatment of cocaine addiction.

876,873,"Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is one of the most prominent neurobiological findings in major depressive disorder (MDD). The relationship of regional brain metabolism to HPA axis dysfunction in depressed patients, however, is still unclear. In this study, to examine the clinical pharmacotherapeutic effects on HPA axis function and brain metabolism in MDD patients, we performed the combined dexamethasone (DEX)/corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test on 24 antidepressant-free patients with MDD a few days after positron emission tomography (PET) with a radiotracer, [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Moreover, 10 patients who responded to pharmacotherapy were re-tested. 75% of unmedicated MDD patients exhibited a heightened cortisol response to the DEX/CRH test, and thus were defined as non-suppressors. Non-suppressors showed a marked hypometabolism in the medial prefrontal cortex as compared with suppressors. After successful pharmacotherapy, enhanced cortisol responsiveness normalized. Prior to treatment of the unmedicated MDD, a significant hypometabolism in various frontal regions and a significant hypermetabolism in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were observed compared with controls. Metabolic activity in treatment responders showed a normalizing pattem in almost all the areas that had been characterized by metabolic abnormality at baseline except for the medial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that depressed patients remitted with antidepressant treatment were accompanied by resolution of HPA dysregulation and alteration of regional glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortical, limbic and paralimbic regions.

877,874,"The goal of this work was to study white matter maturation in young children with autism following previous reports of increased cerebral volume during early development, as well as arguments for abnormal neural growth patterns and regulation at this critical developmental period. We applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high b value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to young children diagnosed with autism and to a typically developing (TD) control group. Fractional anisotropy (FA), probability and displacement were measured in overall analysis as well as in regions of interest (ROI). Individual data points of children with autism were compared to the developmental curves obtained from typically developing children. Increased restriction, reflected in significantly increased FA and probability along with reduced displacement values, was detected in overall analysis as well as in several brain regions. Increased restriction, suggesting an early and accelerated abnormal maturation of white matter, was more dominant in the left hemisphere and was mainly detected in the frontal lobe. No changes were detected in the occipital lobes. These results support previous claims of abnormal brain overgrowth in young children with autism and are in contrast to the decreased restricted diffusion reported in previous studies in adolescent with autism.

878,875,"We readdress the diffusion tractography problem in a global and probabilistic manner. Instead of tracking through local orientations, we parameterise the connexions between brain regions at a global level, and then infer on global and local parameters simultaneously in a Bayesian framework. This approach offers a number of important benefits. The global nature of the tractography reduces sensitivity to local noise and modelling errors. By constraining tractography to ensure a connexion is found, and then inferring on the exact location of the connexion, we increase the robustness of connectivity-based parcellations, allowing parcellations of connexions that were previously invisible to tractography. The Bayesian framework allows a direct comparison of the evidence for connecting and non-connecting models, to test whether the connexion is supported by the data. Crucially, by explicit parameterisation of the connexion between brain regions, we infer on a parameter that is shared with models of functional connectivity. This model is a first step toward the joint inference on functional and anatomical connectivity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

879,876,"Diffusion MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows the measurement of water molecule diffusion through tissue in vivo. The directional features of water diffusion allow one to infer the connectivity patterns prevalent in tissue and possibly track changes in this connectivity over time for various clinical applications. In this paper, we present a novel statistical model for diffusion-weighted MR signal attenuation which postulates that the water molecule diffusion can be characterized by a continuous mixture of diffusion tensors. An interesting observation is that this continuous mixture and the MR signal attenuation are related through the Laplace transform of a probability distribution over symmetric positive definite matrices. We then show that when the mixing distribution is a Wishart distribution, the resulting closed form of the Laplace transform leads to a Rigaut-type asymptotic fractal expression, which has been phenomenologically used in the past to explain the MR signal decay but never with a rigorous mathematical justification until now. Our model not only includes the traditional diffusion tensor model as a special instance in the limiting case, but also can be adjusted to describe complex tissue structure involving multiple fiber populations. Using this new model in conjunction with a spherical deconvolution approach, we present an efficient scheme for estimating the water molecule displacement probability functions on a voxel-by-voxel basis.

Using an optimized voxel-based morphometry protocol, we compared grey matter volume in 12 patients with CD and 12 age-, sex-, and intelligen ce- matched control subjects. Grey matter volume in bilateral anterior insular cortex and the left amygdala was significantly reduced in CD patients compared to healthy control subjects. The insular grey matter abnormalities could be attributed to aggressive behaviour. Moreover, bilateral anterior insular grey matter volume in CD patients correlated significantly with empathy scores. These novel findings point at a joint neuroanatomical substrate underpinning aggressive behaviour and impaired capacity of empathy and suggest a critical role for the anterior insula in regulating social behaviour.

Individuals with WS exhibit mild to moderate mental retardation, but are relatively more proficient in specific language and musical abilities. We used tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to visualize the complex pattern of gray/white matter reductions in WS, based on fluid registration of structural brain images. Methods: 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs of 41 WS subjects (age [mean +/- SD]: 29.2 +/- 9.2 years; 23F/18M) and 39 age-matched healthy controls (age: 27.5 +/- 7.4 years; 23F/16M) were fluidly registered to a minimum deformation target. Fine-scale volumetric differences were mapped between diagnostic groups. Local regions were identified where regional structure volumes were associated with diagnosis, and with intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. Brain asymmetry was also mapped and compared between diagnostic groups. Results: WS subjects exhibited widely distributed brain volume reductions (similar to 10-15% reduction; P< 0.0002, permutation test). After adjusting for total brain volume, the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, fusiform gyrus and cerebellum were found to be relatively preserved in WS, but parietal and occipital lobes, thalamus and basal ganglia, and midbrain were disproportionally decreased in volume (P<0.0002). These regional volumes also correlated positively with performance IQ in adult WS subjects (age >= 30 years, P=0.038). Conclusion: TBM facilitates 3D visualization of brain volume reductions in WS.

882,879,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to study tissue composition and architecture in vivo. To increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of DTI contrasts, studies typically use more than the minimum of 6 diffusion weighting (DW) directions or acquire repeated observations of the same set of DW directions. Simulation-based studies have sought to optimize DTI acquisitions and suggest that increasing the directional resolution of a DTI dataset (i.e., the number of distinct directions) is preferable to repeating observations, in an equal scan time comparison. However, it is not always clear how to translate these recommendations into practice when considering physiological noise and scanner stability. Furthermore, the effect of different DW schemes on ht vivo DTI findings is not fully understood. This study characterizes how the makeup of a DW scheme, in terms of the number of directions, impacts the precision and accuracy of in vivo fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, (MD), and principal eigenvector (PEV) findings. Orientation dependence of DTI reliability is demonstrated in vivo and a principled theoretical framework is provided to support and interpret findings with simulation results. As long as sampling orientations are well balanced, differences in DTI contrasts due to different DW schemes are shown to be small relative to intra-session variability. These differences are accentuated at low SNR, while minimized at high SNR. This result suggests that typical clinical studies, which use similar protocols but different ell-balanced DW schemes, are readily comparable within the experimental precision. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

883,880,"Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) has been applied recently to event-related responses (ERPs) measured with EEG/MEG. DCM attempts to explain ERPs using a network of interacting cortical sources and waveform differences in terms of coupling changes among sources. The aim of this work was to establish the validity of DCM by assessing its reproducibility across subjects. We used an oddball paradigm to elicit mismatch responses. Sources of cortical activity were modelled as equivalent current dipoles, using a biophysical informed spatiotemporal forward model that included connections among neuronal subpopulations in each source. Bayesian inversion provided estimates of changes in coupling among sources and the marginal likelihood of each model. By specifying different connectivity models we were able to evaluate three different hypotheses: differences in the ERPs to rare and frequent events are mediated by changes in forward connections (F-model), backward connections (B-model) or both (FB-model). The results were remarkably consistent over subjects. In all but one subject, the forward model was better than the backward model. This is an important result because these models have the same number of parameters (i.e., the complexity). Furthermore, the FB-model was significantly better than both, in 7 out of 11 subjects. This is another important result because it shows that a more complex model (that can fit the data more accurately) is not necessarily the most likely model. At the group level the FB-model supervened. We discuss these findings in terms of the validity and usefulness of DCM in characterising EEG/MEG data and its ability to model ERPs in a mechanistic fashion. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This probability is estimated by means of probabilistic tissue segmentation and intravoxel white matter orientational distribution function, obtained from anatomical MRI and DW-MRI, respectively.

885,882,"The assessment of voluntary behavior in non-communicative brain injured patients is often challenging due to the existence of profound motor impairment. In the absence of a full understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness, even a normal activation in response to passive sensory stimulation cannot be considered as proof of the presence of awareness in these patients. In contrast, predicted activation in response to the instruction to perform a mental imagery task would provide evidence of voluntary task-dependent brain activity, and hence of consciousness, in non-communicative patients. However, no data yet exist to indicate which imagery instructions would yield reliable single subject activation. The aim of the present study was to establish such a paradigm in healthy volunteers. Two exploratory experiments evaluated the reproducibility of individual brain activation elicited by four distinct mental imagery tasks. The two most robust mental imagery tasks were found to be spatial navigation and motor imagery. In a third experiment, where these two tasks were directly compared, differentiation of each task from one another and from rest periods was assessed blindly using a priori criteria and was correct for every volunteer. The spatial navigation and motor imagery tasks described here permit the identification of volitional brain activation at the single subject level, without a motor response.

The structural brain connections supporting this atypical language dominance have not previously been identified. We performed fMRI of language functions and imaging of white matter connections using MR tractography in 14 patients with unilateral TLE and hippocampal sclerosis and 10 controls. Verb generation and reading comprehension paradigms were used to define functional regions which were used to generate starting regions for tractography. Controls and right TLE patients had a left-lateralised pattern of both language-related activations and the associated structural connections. Left TLE patients showed more symmetrical language activations, along with reduced left hemisphere and increased right hemisphere structural connections. Subjects with more lateralised functional activation had also more highly lateralised connecting pathways. We provide evidence for structural reorganisation of white matter tracts that reflects the altered functional language lateralisation in left TLE patients. The combination of fMRI and tractography offers a promising tool for studying the reorganisation of language functions in many neurological conditions and may prove useful in predicting language deficits following temporal lobe surgery.

888,885,"Recent brain imaging studies have shown that the neural substrates underlying the ability to infer and share the feeling of pain of other individuals overlap with the pain matrix that mediates the process of one's own pain. While there has been evidence that the neural activity mediating pain experience is influenced by top-down attention, it remains unclear whether the neural substrates of empathy for pain are modulated by top-down controlled mechanisms. The current work investigated whether the neural correlates of empathic processes of pain are altered by task demand and prior knowledge of stimulus reality. Subjects were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while watching pictures or cartoons of hands that were in painful or neutral situations. Subjects were asked either to evaluate pain intensity supposedly felt by the model or to count the number of hands in the stimulus displays. Relative to counting neutral stimuli, rating pain intensity of painful pictures and cartoons induced increased activation in ACC/paracingulate and the right middle frontal gyrus. Rating pain intensity also activated the inferior frontal cortex bilaterally and the right insula/putamen for pictures but activated the left parietal cortex, the postcentral gyros, and the occipitotemporal cortex for cartoons. However, the neural activities related to pain rating were eliminated when subjects counted the number of hands in the painful stimuli. In addition, the ACC activity associated with empathy for pain was stronger for the pictures than for the cartoons. Our findings indicate that the involvement of the neural substrates underlying pain-related empathy is constrained by topdown attention and contextual reality of stimuli. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The present study sought to extend this finding to methamphetamine (MA) abusers and to help understand its neural basis. MA abusers (n = 12) and control subjects who did not use illicit drugs (n = 17) participated in tests of delay discounting with hypothetical money rewards. We then used a derived estimate of each individual's delay discounting to generate a functional magnetic resonance imaging probe task consisting of three conditions: ""hard choices,"" requiring selections between ""smaller, sooner"" and ""larger, later"" alternatives that were similarly valued given the individual's delay discounting; ""easy choices,"" in which alternatives differed dramatically in value; and a ""no choice"" control condition. MA abusers exhibited more delay discounting than control subjects (P < 0.05). Across groups, the ""hard choice > no choice"" contrast revealed significant effects in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and areas surrounding the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). With group comparisons limited to these clusters, the ""hard choice > easy choice"" contrast indicated significant group differences in task-related activity within the left DLPFC and right IPS; qualitatively similar nonsignificant effects were present in the other clusters tested. Whereas control subjects showed less recruitment associated with easy than with hard choices, MA abusers generally did not. Correlational analysis did not indicate a relationship between this anomaly in frontoparietal recruitment and greater degree of delay discounting exhibited by MA abusers.

This study examined amygdala reactivity during a task previously used with clinically anxious adolescents. Adolescents were selected for enduring patterns of BI or non-inhibition (BN). We examined amygdala response to evocative emotion faces in BI (N= 10, mean 12.8 years) and BN (N= 17, mean 12.5 years) adolescents while systematically manipulating attention. Analyses focused on amygdala response during subjective ratings of internal fear (constrained attention) and passive viewing (unconstrained attention) during the presentation of emotion faces (Happy, Angry, Fearful, and Neutral). BI adolescents, relative to BN adolescents, showed exaggerated amygdala response during subjective fear ratings and deactivation during passive viewing, across all emotion faces. In addition, the BI group showed an abnormally high amygdala response to a task condition marked by novelty and uncertainty (i.e., rating fear state to a Happy face). Perturbations in amygdala function are evident in adolescents temperamentally at risk for anxiety. Attention state alters the underlying pattern of neural processing, potentially mediating the observed behavioral patterns across development. BI adolescents also show a heightened sensitivity to novelty and uncertainty, which has been linked to anxiety. These patterns of reactivity may time and contribute to the observed relation between BI and anxiety. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

891,888,"A recent study from our laboratory demonstrated that parietal cortex contains a map of visual space related to saccades and spatial attention and identified this area as the likely human homologue of the lateral intraparietal (LIP). A human homologue for the parietal reach region (PRR), thought to preferentially encode planned hand movements, has also been recently proposed. Both of these areas, originally identified in the macaque monkey, have been shown to encode space with eye-centered coordinates. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of humans was used to test the hypothesis that the putative human PRR contains a retinotopic map recruited by finger pointing but not saccades and to test more generally for differences in the visuospatial maps recruited by pointing and saccades. We identified multiple maps in both posterior parietal cortex and superior frontal cortex recruited for eye and hand movements, including maps not observed in previous mapping studies. Pointing and saccade maps were generally consistent within single subjects. We have developed new group analysis methods for phase-encoded data, which revealed subtle differences between pointing and saccades, including hemispheric asymmetries, but we did not find evidence of pointing-specific maps of visual space.

892,889,"It is well established that a lack of social support constitutes a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality, comparable to risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure. Although it has been hypothesized that social support may benefit health by reducing physiological reactivity to stressors, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Moreover, to date, no studies have investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms that translate experiences of social support into the health outcomes that follow. To investigate these processes, thirty participants completed three tasks in which daily social support, neurocognitive reactivity to a social stressor, and neuroendocrine responses to a social stressor were assessed. Individuals who interacted regularly with supportive individuals across a 10-day period showed diminished cortisol reactivity to a social stressor. Moreover, greater social support and diminished cortisol responses were associated with diminished activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and Brodmann's area (BA) 8, regions previously associated with the distress of social separation. Lastly, individual differences in dACC and BA 8 reactivity mediated the relationship between high daily social support and low cortisol reactivity, such that supported individuals showed reduced neurocognitive reactivity to social stressors, which in turn was associated with reduced neuroendocrine stress responses. This study is the first to investigate the neural underpinnings of the social support-health relationship and provides evidence that social support may ultimately benefit health by diminishing neural and physiological reactivity to social stressors.

897,894,"Belief reasoning plays a central role in making inferences about other people's mental states. The ability to reason about false beliefs is considered as a critical test for having a Theory of Mind (ToM). There is some controversy as to whether it is the media] prefrontal cortex (MPFC) or the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) that is centrally involved in belief reasoning. According to developmental studies of belief reasoning we conducted an fMRI experiment with a carefully controlled paradigm (Sally Anne scenario). We compared false belief reasoning with true belief reasoning in parallel tasks, using a series of cartoon stories depicting transfer of an object unbeknownst to the protagonist (false belief) or with the protagonist witnessing (true belief). The false belief versus true belief contrast revealed activation of the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), the right lateral rostral prefrontal cortex and the right TPJ associated with false belief. We suggest that the activation of the dACC and the lateral PFC might be associated with action monitoring and stimulus-independent cognitive processing whereas the activation of the TPJ might be related to the computation of mental representations that create perspective differences, such as a person's false belief that contrasts with reality and therefore might be centrally involved in the decoupling mechanism. Additionally we found common patterns of activation for true and false belief reasoning, including inferior parietal and precuneus activation, but we found no activation of the MPFC or the TPJ in general belief reasoning.

Sixteen antipsychotic drug-naive and three minimally medicated first-episode schizophrenic patients and 19 matched controls participated. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either low doses of the typical antipsychotic drug, zuclopenthixol, or the atypical compound, risperidone. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in patients before and after 12 weeks of exposure to medication and in controls at baseline. Caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and putamen volumes were measured. Compared with controls, absolute volumes of interest (VOIs) were smaller in patients at baseline and increased after treatment. However, with controls for age, gender and whole brain or intracranial volume, the only significant difference between patients and controls was a Hemisphere x Group interaction for the caudate nucleus at baseline, with controls having larger left than right caudate nuclei and patients having marginally larger right than left caudate volumes. Within patients, the two medication groups did not differ significantly with respect to volume changes after 3 months of low dose treatment in any of the VOIs. Nevertheless, when medication groups were examined separately, a significant volume increase in the putamen was evidenced in the risperidone group.

899,896,"Cognitive deficits, including impaired verbal memory, are prominent in schizophrenia and lead to increased disability. Functional neuroimaging of patients with schizophrenia performing memory tasks has revealed abnormal activation patterns in prefrontal cortex and temporo-limbic regions. Aberrant fronto-temporal interactions thus represent a potential pathophysiological mechanism underlying verbal memory deficits, yet this hypothesis of disturbed connectivity is not tested directly with standard activation studies. We performed within-subject correlations of frontal and temporal timeseries to measure functional connectivity during verbal encoding. Our results confirm earlier findings of aberrant fronto-temporal connectivity in schizophrenia, and extend them by identifying distinct alterations within dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex. Relative to healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia had reduced connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporal lobe areas including parahippocampus and superior temporal gyrus. In contrast, patients showed increased connectivity between a region of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and these same temporal lobe regions. Higher temporal-DLPFC connectivity during encoding was associated with better subsequent recognition accuracy in controls, but not patients. Temporal-VLPFC connectivity was uncorrelated with recognition accuracy in either group. The results suggest that reduced temporal-DLPFC connectivity in schizophrenia could underlie encoding deficits, and increased temporal-VLPFC connectivity may represent an ineffective compensatory effort.

902,899,"White matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) is thought to be related to WM integrity and decline in FA is often used as an index of decreasing WM health. However, the relationship of FA to other structural indices of cerebral health has not been well studied. We hypothesized that the decline in WM health will be associated with changes in several other indices of cerebral health. In this manuscript we studied the correlation between whole-brain/hemispheric/corpus callosum FA and gray matter (GM) thickness, sulcal span, and the volume of T2-hyperintense WM in a group of 31 healthy aging individuals (12 males/19 females) aged 57-82 years old. Individual subjects' FA measures were calculated from diffusion tracing imaging (DTI) data using tract-based spatial statistics-an approach specifically designed and validated for voxel-wise multi-subject FA analysis. Age-controlled correlation analysis showed that whole-brain average FA values were significantly and positively correlated with the subject's average GM thickness and negatively correlated with hyperintense WM volume. Intra-hemispheric correlations between FA and other measures of cerebral health had generally greater effect sizes than inter-hemispheric correction, with correlation between left FA and left GM thickness being the most significant (r=0.6, p < 0.01). Regional analysis of FA values showed that late-myelinating fiber tracts of the genu of corpus callosum had higher association with other cerebral health indices. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that late-myelinating regions of the brain bear the brunt of age-related degenerative changes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

903,900,"This study investigated the spatio-temporal properties of blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signals in gray matter, excluding the confounding, inaccurate contributions of large blood vessels. We quantified the spatial specificity of the BOLD response, and we investigated whether this specificity varies as a function of time from stimulus onset. fMRI was performed at 7 Tesla (T), where mapping signals of parenchymal origin are easily detected. Two abutting visual stimuli were adjusted to elicit responses centered on a flat gray matter region in V1. fMRI signals were sampled at high-resolution orthogonal to the retinotopic boundary between the representations of the stimuli. Signals from macro-vessels were masked out. Principal component analysis revealed that the first component in space accounted for 96.2 +/- 1.6% of the variance over time. The spatial profile of this time-invariant response was fitted with a model consisting of the convolution of a step function and a Gaussian point-spread-function (PSF). The mean full-width at half-maximal-height of the fitted PSF was 2.34 +/- 0.20 mm. Based on simulations of confounding effects, we estimate that BOLD PSF in human gray matter is smaller than 2 mm. A time-point to time-point analysis revealed that the PSF obtained during the 3rd (1.52 mm) and 4th (1.99 mm) seconds of stimulation were narrower than the mean PSF obtained from the 5th second on (2.42 +/- 0.15 mm). The position of the edge of the responding region was offset (1.72 +/- 0.07 mm) from the boundary of the stimulated region, indicating a spatial non-linearity. Simulations showed that the effective contrast between active and non-active columns is reduced 25-fold when imaged using a PSF whose width is equal to the cycle of the imaged columnar organization. Thus, the PSF of the hyper-oxygenated BOLD response in human gray matter is narrower than that reported at 1.5 T, where macrovessels dominate the mapping signals. The initial phase of this response is more spatially specific than later phases. Data acquisition methods that suppress macro-vascular signals should increase the spatial specificity of BOLD fMRI. The choice of optimal stimulus duration represents a trade-off between the spatial specificity and the overhead associated with short stimulus duration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We quantified the spatial specificity of the BOLD response, and we investigated whether this specificity varies as a function of time from stimulus onset. fMRI was performed at 7 Tesla (T), where mapping signals of parenchymal origin are easily detected. Two abutting visual stimuli were adjusted to elicit responses centered on a flat gray matter region in V1. fMRI signals were sampled at high-resolution orthogonal to the retinotopic boundary between the representations of the stimuli. Signals from macro-vessels were masked out. Principal component analysis revealed that the first component in space accounted for 96.2 +/- 1.6% of the variance over time. The spatial profile of this time-invariant response was fitted with a model consisting of the convolution of a step function and a Gaussian point-spread-function (PSF). The mean full-width at half-maximal-height of the fitted PSF was 2.34 +/- 0.20 mm. Based on simulations of confounding effects, we estimate that BOLD PSF in human gray matter is smaller than 2 mm. A time-point to time-point analysis revealed that the PSF obtained during the 3rd (1.52 mm) and 4th (1.99 mm) seconds of stimulation were narrower than the mean PSF obtained from the 5th second on (2.42 +/- 0.15 mm). The position of the edge of the responding region was offset (1.72 +/- 0.07 mm) from the boundary of the stimulated region, indicating a spatial non-linearity. Simulations showed that the effective contrast between active and non-active columns is reduced 25-fold when imaged using a PSF whose width is equal to the cycle of the imaged columnar organization. Thus, the PSF of the hyper-oxygenated BOLD response in human gray matter is narrower than that reported at 1.5 T, where macrovessels dominate the mapping signals. The initial phase of this response is more spatially specific than later phases. Data acquisition methods that suppress macro-vascular signals should increase the spatial specificity of BOLD fMRI. The choice of optimal stimulus duration represents a trade-off between the spatial specificity and the overhead associated with short stimulus duration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

904,901,"Characteristic fear behaviour like putting the bands in front of the face and running for cover provides strong fear signals to observers who may not themselves be aware of any danger. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, we investigated how such dynamic fear signals from the whole body are perceived. A factorial design allowed us to investigate brain activity induced by viewing bodies, bodily expressions of fear and the role of dynamic information in viewing them. Our critical findings are threefold. We find that viewing neutral and fearful body expressions enhances amygdala activity; moreover actions expressing fear activate the temporal pole and lateral orbital cortex more than neutral actions; and finally differences in activations between static and dynamic bodily expressions were larger for actions expressing fear in the STS and premotor cortex compared to neutral actions.

905,902,"The ability to evaluate outcomes of previous decisions is critical to adaptive decision-making. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is an event-related potential (ERP) modulation that distinguishes losses from wins, but little is known about the effects of outcome probability on these ERP responses. Further, little is known about the frequency characteristics of feedback processing, for example, event-related oscillations and phase synchronizations. Here, we report an EEG experiment designed to address these issues. Subjects engaged in a probabilistic reinforcement learning task in which we manipulated, across blocks, the probability of winning and losing to each of two possible decision options. Behaviorally, all subjects quickly adapted their decision-making to maximize rewards. ERP analyses revealed that the probability of reward modulated neural responses to wins, but not to losses. This was seen both across blocks as well as within blocks, as learning progressed. Frequency decomposition via complex wavelets revealed that EEG responses to losses, compared to wins, were associated with enhanced power and phase coherence in the theta frequency band. As in the ERP analyses, power and phase coherence values following wins but not losses were modulated by reward probability. Some findings between ERP and frequency analyses diverged, suggesting that these analytic approaches provide complementary insights into neural processing.

908,905,"The cortical hemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulus is investigated at the level of individual vascular compartments using both depth-resolved optical imaging and in-vivo two-photon microscopy. We utilize a new imaging and spatiotemporal analysis approach that exploits the different characteristic dynamics of responding arteries, arterioles, capillaries and veins to isolate their three-dimensional spatial extent within the cortex. This spatial delineation is validated using vascular casts. Temporal delineation is supported by in-vivo two-photon microscopy of the temporal dynamics and vascular mechanisms of the arteriolar and venous responses. Using these techniques we have been able to characterize the roles of the different vascular compartments in generating and controlling the hemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulus. We find that changes in arteriolar total hemoglobin concentration agree well with arteriolar dilation dynamics, which in turn correspond closely with changes in venous blood flow. For 4-s stimuli, we see only small changes in venous hemoglobin concentration, and do not detect measurable dilation or ballooning in the veins. Instead, we see significant evidence of capillary hyperemia. We compare our findings to historical observations of the composite hemodynamic response from other modalities including functional magnetic resonance imaging. Implications of our results are discussed with respect to mathematical models of cortical hemodynamics, and to current theories on the mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling. We also conclude that our spatiotemporal analysis approach is capable of isolating and localizing signals from the capillary bed local to neuronal activation, and holds promise for improving the specificity of other hemodynamic imaging modalities.

909,906,"Previous neuroimaging studies have found hyperactivation in the cerebellum and motor cortex and hypoactivation in the basal ganglia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) but the relationship between the two has not been established. This study examined whether cerebellar and motor cortex hyperactivation is a compensatory mechanism for hypoactivation in the basal ganglia or is a pathophysiological response that is related to the signs of the disease. Using a BOLD contrast fMRI paradigm PD patients and healthy controls performed automatic and cognitively controlled thumb pressing movements. Regions of interest analysis quantified the BOLD activation in motor areas, and correlations between the hyperactive and hypoactive regions were performed, along with correlations between the severity of upper limb rigidity and BOLD activation. There were three main findings. First, the putamen, supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-SMA were hypoactive in PD patients. The left and right cerebellum and the contralateral motor cortex were hyperactive in PD patients. Second, I'D patients had a significant negative correlation between the BOLD activation in the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral putamen. The correlation between the putamen and motor cortex was not significant. Third, the BOLD activation in the motor cortex was positively correlated with the severity of upper limb rigidity, but the BOLD activation in the cerebellum was not correlated with rigidity. Further, the activation in the motor cortex was not correlated with upper extremity bradykinesia. These findings provide new evidence supporting the hypothesis that hyperactivation in the ipsilateral cerebellum is a compensatory mechanism for the defective basal ganglia. Our findings also provide the first evidence from neuroimaging that hyperactivation in the contralateral primary motor cortex is not a compensatory response but is directly related to upper limb rigidity.

This paper presents a methodology for developing unbiased, high resolution iterative registration templates from a group of 222 subject hemispheres and shows that the resulting template provides better alignment of a separate set of test data than single-subject templates. It demonstrates that between 30 and 50 subjects are required to generate a stable iterative template. It also explores the way in which fold variants in registration templates affect the quality of registration. Finally, it shows that hemisphere-specific group registration templates systematically better register subject hemispheres of the same laterality, underlining the need to develop templates free of hemisphere bias for asymmetry analysis.

However, their effectiveness as relative head-surface-based positioning systems has not been examined. We previously developed a virtual 10/20 measurement algorithm that can analyze any structural MR head and brain image. Extending this method to the virtual 10/10 and 10/5 measurement algorithms, we analyzed the MR images of 17 healthy subjects. The acquired scalp positions of the 10/10 and 1015 systems were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic coordinates and their spatial variability was assessed. We described and examined the effects of spatial variability due to the selection of positioning systems and landmark placement strategies. As long as a detailed rule for a particular system was provided, it yielded precise landmark positions on the scalp. Moreover, we evaluated the effective spatial resolution of 329 scalp landmark positions of the 10/5 system for multi-subject studies. As long as a detailed rule for landmark setting was provided, 241 scalp positions could be set effectively when there was no overlapping of two neighboring positions. Importantly, 10/10 positions could be well separated on a scalp without overlapping.

913,910,"Brain atrophy associated with chronic alcohol consumption is partially reversible after cessation of drinking. Recovering alcoholics (RA, 45 +/- 8 years) were studied with MRI within 1 week of entering treatment, with follow-up at 8 months. Light drinkers (LD) were studied with MRI twice 1 year apart. For each participant, deformation maps of baseline structure and longitudinal size changes between baseline and follow-up scans were created using nonlinear registration techniques. ANCOVA assessed group differences and regression methods examined relationships between deformation maps and measures of drinking severity or baseline atrophy. At baseline, RA showed significant atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes. Longitudinally, abstainers recovered tissue volumes significantly faster than LD in parietal and frontal lobes. When comparing abstainers to relapsers, additional regions with significantly greater recovery in abstainers were temporal lobes, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, corpus callosum, anterior cingulate, insula, and subcortical white matter. Gray matter volume at baseline predicted volume recovery during abstinence better than white matter. Drinking severity was not significantly related to brain structural changes assessed with this method. Longitudinally, deformation-based morphometry confirmed tissue recovery in RAs who maintain long-term sobriety.

Fractional anisotropy maps were obtained from an EPI diffusion sequence using parallel imaging to reduce distortion artifacts. We used high-dimensional image warping to control for partial volume effects due to white matter atrophy in AD. We found a significant regional pattern of fiber changes (p < 0.01) indicating that the integrity of intracortical projecting fiber tracts (including corpus callosum, cingulum and fornix, and frontal, temporal and occipital lobe white matter areas) was reduced, whereas extracortical projecting fiber tracts, including the pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems and somatosensory projections, were relatively preserved in AD. Effects of a univariate analysis were almost entirely contained within the multivariate effect. Our findings illustrate the use of a multivariate approach to fractional anisotropy data that takes advantage of the highly organized structure of anisotropy maps, and is independent of multiple comparison correction and partial volume effects.

915,912,"We describe a new algorithm for the automated segmentation of the hippocampus (He) and the amygdala (Am) in clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Based on homotopically deforming regions, our iterative approach allows the simultaneous extraction of both structures, by means of dual competitive growth. One of the most original features of our approach is the deformation constraint based on prior knowledge of anatomical features that are automatically retrieved from the MRI data. The only manual intervention consists of the definition of a bounding box and positioning of two seeds; total execution time for the two structures is between 5 and 7 min including initialisation. The method is evaluated on 16 young healthy subjects and 8 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) for whom the atrophy ranged from limited to severe. Three aspects of the performances are characterised for validating the method: accuracy (automated vs. manual segmentations), reproducibility of the automated segmentation and reproducibility of the manual segmentation. For 16 young healthy subjects, accuracy is characterised by mean relative volume error/overlap/maximal boundary distance of 7%/84%/4.5 mm for He and 12%/81%/3.9 mm for Am; for 8 Alzheimer's disease patients, it is 9%/ 84%/6.5 mm for He and 15%/76%/4.5 mm for Am. We conclude that the performance of this new approach in data from healthy and diseased subjects in terms of segmentation quality, reproducibility and time efficiency compares favourably with that of previously published manual and automated segmentation methods. The proposed approach provides a new framework for further developments in quantitative analyses of the pathological hippocampus and amygdala in MRI scans. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

916,913,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequent psychiatric disorder in children, yet data are sparse on its pathophysiology. Particularly relevant are the dopamine transporters since these are the main targets of stimulant medications used for ADHD treatment. Though some imaging studies have shown increases in dopamine transporters in ADHD others have not and their role in the neurobiology of ADHD remains unclear. Here we investigate dopamine transporters in ADHD subjects with control of potentially confounding factors (previous medication and/or drug histories, comorbidity) and their association with clinical symptoms. Positron emission tomography and [C-11]cocaine were used to measure dopamine transporters in 20 never medicated adults with ADHD and 25 controls. Dopamine transporters were lower in left caudate (13%, p < 0.05) and in left nucleus accumbens (p < 0.005) in ADHD subjects than in controls. In putamen dopamine transporters did not differ between groups but were associated with scores of inattention (Conners Adult Attention Rating Scale) both in ADHD subjects (p < 0.005) and in controls (p < 0.005). Thus, for a given transporter level the scores for inattention were on average five times greater in ADHD subjects than in controls. These results do not corroborate increases in dopamine transporters in ADHD subjects and show that in some they are reduced. It also provides evidence that dopamine transporter levels modulate attention but suggest that additional pathology (e.g., prefrontal or cingulostriatal pathways, noradrenergic neurotransmission) is necessary to account for the large differences in inattention observed between controls and ADHD subjects.

917,914,"Research on the neural basis of working memory (WM) has generally focused on neocortical regions; comparatively little is known about the role of subcortical structures. There is growing evidence that the basal ganglia are involved in WM, but their contribution to different component processes of WM is poorly understood. We examined the temporal dynamics of basal ganglia response and connectivity during the. encoding, maintenance and response phases of a Sternberg WM task. During the encoding and maintenance phases, WM-load-dependent activation was observed in the left anterior caudate, anterior putamen and globus pallidus; activation in the right anterior caudate was observed only during the maintenance phase. During the response phase, the basal ganglia were equally active in both the high-load and low-load WM conditions. Caudate and putamen activations were primarily localized to the (rostral) associative parts of the basal ganglia, consistent with the putative role of these regions in cognitive processing. Effective connectivity analyses revealed increased WM-load-dependent interaction of the left anterior caudate with the left posterior parietal cortex during all three phases of the task; with the visual association cortex, including the fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus, only during the encoding phase; with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the encoding and maintenance phases; with the pre-supplementary motor area during the maintenance and response phases; and with the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices only during the response phase. Taken together with known neuroanatomy of the basal ganglia, these results suggest that the anterior caudate helps to link signals in distinct functional networks during different phases of the WM task. Our study offers new insight into the integrative and adaptive role of the basal ganglia in higher cognitive function. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

918,915,"Objective: Aim of present study was to evaluate changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters in the whole brain of 28 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) compared to 26 healthy controls. Methods: In both fibertracking and voxel-based analysis, quantitative comparisons of the diffusion parameters between ALS patients and controls were performed. Correlation analyses of diffusion parameters and disease duration and disease severity were performed. A second DTI examination was acquired, allowing the evaluation of the effect of disease progression on the diffusion parameters. Results: Fibertracking analysis revealed that especially the precentral part of the corticospinal tract (CST) was impaired. In the voxel-based analysis, it was shown that changes of diffusion parameters occurred throughout the brain, including frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Disease severity was inversely correlated with the fractional anisotropy (EA). In the follow-up examination, a further decline of FA over time could be demonstrated in the CST as well as in the whole brain white matter. Interpretation: This study provides support for the view of ALS as being a multisystem degenerative disease, in which abnormalities of extramotor areas play an important role in the in vivo physiopathology.

919,916,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to predominantly affect white matter (WM). Recently, however, loss of cortical gray matter has also been described. Little is known about the cause of cortical atrophy in MS, whether it occurs early in the disease course, and whether it affects all cortical regions equally or if there is a preferential pattern of focal cortical atrophy. An automated method was used to compute the thickness at every vertex of the cortical surface of the brains of 425 early relapsing-remitting MS patients. We correlated cortical thickness with the WM lesion load and the Expanded Disability Status Scale score. Mean cortical thickness correlated with WM lesion load and disability. The correlations of cortical thickness with total lesion load and disability were most significant in cingulate gyrus, insula, and associative cortical regions. Conversely, primary sensory, visual, and motor areas showed a less significant relationship. The highest amount of atrophy per lesion volume or disability scale unit was in the anterior cingulate cortex. This study confirms the relation between cortical atrophy, WM lesion load, and disability in MS, and suggests that cortical atrophy occurs even in MS patients with only mild disability. Most interestingly, we show a specific regional pattern of focal atrophy in MS that is distinctively different from the one in normal aging. The predilection of the atrophic process for areas that are heavily interconnected with other brain regions suggests that interruption of WM tracts by MS plaques contributes, at least in part, to the development of cortical atrophy.

Different methods have been proposed to remove the BCG artefact focusing on channel-wise template subtraction procedures or spatial filtering approaches such as independent component analysis (ICA). Here we systematically compared the performance of the optimal basis set (OBS), a channel-wise correction approach, with ICA and a recently proposed combination of both (OBS-ICA). The three different procedures were applied to 60-channel EEG data from 12 subjects recorded during fMRI acquisition in a 3-T scanner. In addition to examination of the residual BCG artefact, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the topography of the resulting auditory evoked potential component NI were compared. Whereas all three approaches led to a significant artefact reduction, the ICA procedure resulted in a significantly reduced NI SNR and amplitude when compared to BCG-uncorrected data, indicating a rather poor performance. In contrast to ICA, OBS and OBS-ICA corrected data substantially improved the SNR of the N1. The quality of the auditory evoked potential NI topography was investigated by means of equivalent current dipole modelling. On a descriptive level, all three correction procedures led to a reduced localization error when compared to BCG-uncorrected data. This improvement was significant for OBS-ICA.

922,919,"The motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been linked to an abnormal spatial covariance pattern involving basal ganglia thalamocortical pathways. By contrast, little is known about the functional networks that underlie cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. To identify such patterns, we studied 15 non-demented PD patients using FDG PET and a voxel-based network modeling approach. We detected a significant covariance pattern that correlated (p < 0.01) with performance on tests of memory and executive functioning. This PD-related cognitive pattern (PDCP) was characterized by metabolic reductions in frontal and parietal association areas and relative increases in the cerebellar vermis and dentate nuclei. To validate this pattern, we analyzed data from 32 subsequent PD patients of similar age, disease duration and severity. Prospective measurements of PDCP activity predicted memory performance (p < 0.005), visuospatial function (p < 0.01), and perceptual motor speed (p < 0.005) in this validation sample. PDCP scores additionally exhibited an excellent degree of test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC=0.89) in patients undergoing repeat FDG PET at an 8-week interval. Unlike the PD-related motor pattern, PDCP expression was not significantly altered by antiparkinsonian treatment with either intravenous levodopa or deep brain stimulation (DBS). These findings substantiate the PDCP as a reproducible imaging marker of cognitive function in PD. Because PDCP expression is not altered by routine antiparkinsonian treatment, this measure of network activity may prove useful in clinical trials targeting the progression of non-motor manifestations of this disorder.

924,921,"In recent years, multiple brain MR imaging modalities have emerged; however, analysis methodologies have mainly remained modality-specific. In addition, when comparing across imaging modalities, most researchers have been forced to rely on simple region-of-interest type analyses, which do not allow the voxel-by-voxel comparisons necessary to answer more sophisticated neuroscience questions. To overcome these limitations, we developed a toolbox for multimodal image analysis called biological parametric mapping (BPM), based on a voxel-wise use of the general linear model. The BPM toolbox incorporates information obtained from other modalities as regressors in a voxel-wise analysis, thereby permitting investigation of more sophisticated hypotheses. The BPM toolbox has been developed in Matlab with a user-friendly interface for performing analyses, including voxel-wise multimodal correlation, ANCOVA, and multiple regression. It has a high degree of integration with the SPM (statistical parametric mapping) software relying on it for visualization and statistical inference. Furthermore, statistical inference for a correlation field, rather than a widely used T-field, has been implemented in the correlation analysis for more accurate results. An example with in vivo data is presented, demonstrating the potential of the BPM methodology as a tool for multimodal image analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

925,922,"We present a general method for the classification of independent components (ICs) extracted from functional MRI (fMRI) data sets. The method consists of two steps. In the first step, each FMRI-IC is associated with an IC-fingerprint, i.e., a representation of the component in a multidimensional space of parameters. These parameters are post hoc estimates of global properties of the ICs and are largely independent of a specific experimental design and stimulus timing. In the second step a machine learning algorithm automatically separates the IC-fingerprints into six general classes after preliminary training performed on a small subset of expert-labeled components. We illustrate this approach in a multisubject fMRI study employing visual structure-from-motion stimuli encoding faces and control random shapes. We show that: (1) IC-fingerprints are a valuable tool for the inspection, characterization and selection of fMRI-ICs and (2) automatic classifications of FMRI-ICs in new subjects present a high correspondence with those obtained by expert visual inspection of the components. Importantly, our classification procedure highlights several neuro-physiologically interesting processes. The most intriguing of which is reflected, with high intra- and inter-subject reproducibility, in one IC exhibiting a transiently task-related activation in the 'face' region of the primary sensorimotor cortex. This suggests that in addition to or as part of the mirror system, somatotopic regions of the sensorimotor cortex are involved in disambiguating the perception of a moving body part.

926,923,"Currently available laboratory procedures might provide additional information to psychiatric diagnostic systems for more valid classifications of mental disorders. To identify the correlative pattern of gray matter distribution that best discriminates schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects, we applied discriminant function analysis techniques using the multivariate linear model and the voxel-based morphometry. The first analysis was conducted to obtain a statistical model that classified 30 male healthy subjects and 30 male schizophrenia patients diagnosed according to current operational criteria. The second analysis was performed to prospectively validate the statistical model by successfully classifying a new cohort that consisted of 16 male healthy subjects and 16 male schizophrenia patients. Inferences about the structural relevance of the gray matter distribution could be made if the individual profile of pattern expression could be linked to the specific diagnosis of each subject. The result was that 90% of the subjects were correctly classified by the eigenimage, and the Jackknife approach revealed well above chance accuracy. The pattern of the eigenimage was characterized by positive loadings indicating gray matter decline in the patients in the lateral and medial prefrontal regions, insula, lateral temporal regions, medial temporal structures, and thalamus as well as the negative loadings reflecting gray matter increase in the patients in the putamen and cerebellum. When the eigenimage derived from the original cohort was applied to classify data from the second cohort, it correctly assigned more than 80% of the healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients. These findings suggest that the characteristic distribution of gray matter changes may be of diagnostic value for schizophrenia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

927,924,"To investigate brain mechanisms whereby electrical stimulation of the motor cortex (MCS) may induce pain relief in patients with neuropathic pain, cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes were studied using H2O PET in 19 consecutive patients treated with MCS for refractory neuropathic pain. Patients were studied in three conditions, (a) before MCS (Baseline, stimulator stopped 4 weeks before), (b) during a 35-min period of MCS and (c) during a 75-min period after MCS had been discontinued (OFF). Compared to Baseline, turning on the stimulator was associated with CBF increase in the contralateral (anterior) midcingulate cortex (aMCC, BA24 and 32) and in the dorso-lateral prefrontal (BA10) cortices. The most important changes of CBF were observed in the 75 min after discontinuation of MCS (OFF). This post-stimulation period was associated with CBF increases in a large set of cortical and subcortical regions (from posterior MCC (pMCC) to pregenual (pg) ACC, orbitufrontal cortex, putamen, thalami, posterior cingulate and prefrontal areas) and in the brainstem (mesencephalon/periaqueductal grey (PAG) and pons). CBF changes in the post-stimulation period correlated with pain relief. Functional connectivity analysis showed significant correlation between pgACC and PAG, basal ganglia, and lower pons activities, supporting the activation of descending ACC-to-PAG connections. MCS may act in part through descending (top-down) inhibitory controls that involve prefrontal, orbitofrontal and ACC as well as basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem. These hemodynamic changes are lengthened and might therefore underlie the long-lasting clinical effects that largely outlast the actual stimulation periods. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

928,925,"Functional imaging during movement of the hand affected by a stroke has shown excess activation of the contralesional motor network, implying less physiological hemisphere activation balance. Although this may be adaptive, the relationship between the severity of motor deficit and the hemisphere activation balance for the four major cortical motor areas has not been systematically studied. We prospectively studied 19 right-handed patients with first-ever stroke (age range 61 10 years) in the stable phase of recovery (> 3 months after onset), using auditory-paced index-thumb (IT) tapping of the affected hand at 1.25 Hz as the fMRI paradigm. The hemisphere activation balance for the primary motor (M1), primary somatosensory (S1), supplementary motor (SMA) and dorsal premotor (PMd) areas was measured by a modified weighted laterality index (wLI), and correlations with motor performance (assessed by the affected/unaffected ratio of maximum IT taps in 15 s, termed IT-R) were computed. There were statistically significant negative correlations between IT-R and the wLI for M1 and SI, such that the more the hemispheric balance shifted contralesionally, the worse the performance. Furthermore, worse performance was related to a greater amount of contralesional, but not ipsilesional, activation. No significant correlation between IT-R and the wLI was obtained for the SMA and PMd, which functionally have stronger bilateral organization. These findings suggest that the degree of recovery of fine ringer motion after stroke is determined by the extent to which activation balance in the primary sensory motor areas - where most corticospinal fibers originate - departs from normality. This observation may have implications for therapy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, however, paradigms have been studied in which the converse operation is performed, thus inferring behavioral or mental states associated with activation images. Here, we use the well-known retinotopy of the visual cortex to infer the visual content of real or imaginary scenes from the brain activation patterns that they elicit. We present two decoding algorithms: an explicit technique, based on the current knowledge of the retinotopic structure of the visual areas, and an implicit technique, based on supervised classifiers. Both algorithms predicted the stimulus identity with significant accuracy. Furthermore, we extend this principle to mental imagery data: in five data sets, our algorithms could reconstruct and predict with significant accuracy a pattern imagined by the subjects.

930,927,"The purpose of this pilot study was to: (1) determine if regional brain volume change occurs in schizophrenia patients during very short periods of withdrawal from, or stable treatment with, antipsychotics, and; (2) compare results of region-of-interest (ROI) to voxel-based morphometry (VBM) methods. In two small groups of schizophrenic inpatients, magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after antipsychotic withdrawal, and at two time points during stable chronic antipsychotic treatment. Regional brain volumes were measured using ROI methods. Grey matter volume was measured with VBM. The medication withdrawal group showed no effect of treatment state or antipsychotic type on regional brain volumes with ROI analysis, but effects of both treatment state and antipsychotic type on grey matter volume were observed with VBM in right middle frontal, right medial frontal, right and left superior frontal, right cingulate, and fight superior temporal gyrii as well as in the right and left hippocampal gyrii. The chronic stable treatment group showed an effect of time on right caudate, left hippocampal, and total cerebrospinal fluid volumes with ROI analysis, while effects of both time and antipsychotic type were observed with VBM on grey matter volume in the left superior temporal lobe. No findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. A positive correlation between regional volume change and emerging psychopathology was demonstrated using ROI methods in the medication withdrawal group. Treatment state and emergent symptoms in schizophrenia patients were associated with regional volume change over very short time periods. Longitudinal regional brain volume change in schizophrenia patients is likely physiologic and therefore potentially reversible. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

931,928,"Brain imaging studies of the hippocampus in autism have yielded inconsistent results. In this study, a computational mapping strategy was used to examine the three-dimensional profile of hippocampal abnormalities in autism. Twenty-one mates with autism (age: 9.5 +/- 3.3 years) and 24 male controls (age: 10.3 +/- 2.4 years) underwent a volumetric magnetic resonance imaging scan at 3 Tesla. The hippocampus was delineated, using an anatomical protocol, and hippocampal volumes were compared between the two groups. Hippocampal traces were also converted into three-dimensional parametric surface meshes, and statistical brain maps were created to visualize morphological differences in the shape and thickness of the hippocampus between groups. Parametric surface meshes and shape analysis revealed subtle differences between patients and controls, particularly in the right posterior hippocampus. These deficits were significant even though the groups did not differ significantly with traditional measures of hippocampal volume. These results suggest that autism may be associated with subtle regional reductions in the size of the hippocampus. The increased statistical and spatial. power of computational mapping methods provided the ability to detect these differences, which were not found with traditional volumetric methods.

933,930,"As diffusion tractography is increasingly used to generate quantitative measures to address clinical questions, it is important to characterise the inter-session reproducibility and inter-subject variability of these measures. Here, we assess the reproducibility and variability of diffusion tractography measures using diffusion data from 8 subjects scanned 3 times. We used probabilistic tractography to define the cingulum bundle, pyramidal tracts, optic radiations and germ of the corpus callosum in each individual data set using three different methods of seed definition. Measures of mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) along the tracts were more reproducible than measures of tract volume. Further, tracts defined using a two region of interest (ROI) approach were more reproducible than those defined using manually placed seed masks alone. For mean FA taken from tracts defined using the two ROI approach, inter-session coefficients of variation (CV) were all below 5% and inter-subject CVs were below 10%; for mean MD inter-session, CVs were all below 3% and inter-subject CVs were below 8%. We use the variability measures found here to calculate the sample sizes required to detect changes in FA, MD or tract volume of a given size, either between groups of subjects or within subjects over time. Finally, we compare tractography results using 60 diffusion encoding directions to those found using a subset of 12 directions; the number of diffusion directions did not have a significant effect on reproducibility, but tracts derived using fewer directions were consistently smaller than those derived using 60 direction data. We suggest that 12 direction data are sufficient for reproducibly defining the core of large bundles but may be less sensitive to smaller pathways. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

934,931,"Since its inception, experimental psychology has sought to account for individual differences in human performance. Some neuroimaging research, involving complex behavioral paradigms, has suggested that faster-performing individuals show greater neural activity than slower performers. Other research has suggested that faster-performing individuals show less neural activity than slower performers. To examine the neural basis of individual performance differences, we had participants perform a simple speeded-processing task during fMRI scanning. In some prefrontal cortical (PFC) brain regions, faster performers showed less cortical activity than slower performers while in other PFC and parietal regions they showed greater activity. Regional-causality analysis indicated that PFC exerted more influence over other brain regions for slower than for faster individuals. These results suggest that a critical determinant of individual performance differences is the efficiency of interactions between brain regions and that slower individuals may require more prefrontal executive control than faster individuals to perform successfully (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Neural correlates of cognitive efficiency,2006,NEUROIMAGE,Article,17010646,['fMRI'],2.31,fMRI
935,932,"Cerebral hemispheric specialization has traditionally been described using a lateralization index (LI). Such an index, however, shows a very severe threshold dependency and is prone to be influenced by statistical outliers. Reliability of this index thus has been inherently weak, and the assessment of this reliability is as yet not possible as methods to detect such outliers are not available. Here, we propose a new approach to calculating a lateralization index on functional magnetic resonance imaging data by combining a bootstrap procedure with a histogram analysis approach. Synthetic and real functional magnetic resonance imaging data was used to assess performance of our approach. Using a bootstrap algorithm, 10,000 indices are iteratively calculated at different thresholds, yielding a robust mean, maximum and minimum LI and thus allowing to attach a confidence interval to a given index. Taking thresholds into account, an overall weighted bootstrapped lateralization index is calculated. Additional histogram analyses of these bootstrapped values allow to judge reliability and the influence of outliers within the data. We conclude that the proposed methods yield a robust and specific lateralization index, sensitively detect outliers and allow to assess the underlying data quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

936,933,"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an emerging non-invasive tool for functional neuroimaging, has evolved as a multichannel technique allowing simultaneous measurements through many channels ranging from below ten to above hundred. Simultaneous testing of such a large number of channels escalates the risk of Type I error, therefore multiplicity correction is unavoidable. To date, only a few studies have considered this issue using Bonferroni correction, which is an effective conservative solution, but may be too severe for neuroimaging. Its power varies in inverse proportion of the number of channels, which varies among NIRS studies depending on selected region of interest (1101), thereby leading to a subjective inference. This problem may be well circumvented by a more contemporary approach, called false discovery rate (FDR) that is widely being adopted in functional neuroimaging. An FDR-based procedure controls the expected proportion of erroneously rejected hypotheses among the rejected hypotheses, which offers a more objective, powerful, and consistent measure of Type I error than Bonferroni correction and maintains a better balance between power and specificity. In this technical note, we examine FDR approach using examples from simulated and real NIRS data. The FDR-based procedure could yield 52% more power than Bonferroni correction in a 172-channel real NIRS study and proved to be more robust against the changing number of channels.

937,934,"Motor imagery is widely used to study cognitive aspects of the neural control of action. However, what is exactly simulated during motor imagery is still a matter of debate. On the one hand, it is conceivable that motor imagery is an embodied cognitive process, involving a simulation of movements of one's own body. The alternative possibility is that, although motor imagery relies on knowledge of the motor processes, it does not entail an actual motor simulation that is influenced by the physical configuration of one's own body. Here we discriminate between these two hypotheses, in the context of an established motor imagery task: laterality judgments of rotated hand drawings. We found that reaction times of hand laterality judgments followed the biomechanical constraints of left or right hand movements. Crucially, the position of subjects' own left and right arm influenced laterality judgments of left and right hands. In neural terms, hand laterality judgments activated a parieto-frontal network. The activity within this network increased with increasing biomechanical complexity of the imagined hand movements, even when the amount of stimulus rotation was identical. Moreover, activity in the intraparietal sulcus was modulated by subjects' own hand position: a larger incongruence in orientation between the subjects' hand and the stimulus hand led to a selective increase in intraparietal activity. Our results indicate that motor imagery generates motor plans that depend on the current configuration of the limbs. This motor plan is calculated by a parieto-frontal network. Within this network, the posterior parietal cortex appears to incorporate proprioceptive information related to the current position of the body into the motor plan. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

938,935,"Using a modified sparse temporal sampling fMRI technique, we examined both shared and distinct neural correlates of singing and speaking. In the experimental conditions, 10 right-handed subjects were asked to repeat intoned (""sung"") and non-intoned (""spoken"") bisyllabic words/phrases that were contrasted with conditions controlling for pitch (""humming"") and the basic motor processes associated with vocalization (""vowel production""). Areas of activation common to all tasks included the inferior pre- and post-central gyrus, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and superior temporal sulcus (STS) bilaterally, indicating a large shared network for motor preparation and execution as well as sensory feedback/control for vocal production. The speaking more than vowel-production contrast revealed activation in the inferior frontal gyrus most likely related to motor planning and preparation, in the primary sensorimotor cortex related to motor execution, and the middle and posterior STG/STS related to sensory feedback. The singing more than speaking contrast revealed additional activation in the mid-portions of the STG (more strongly on the right than left) and the most inferior and middle portions of the primary sensorimotor cortex. Our results suggest a bihemispheric network for vocal production regardless of whether the words/phrases were intoned or spoken. Furthermore, singing more than humming (""intoned speaking"") showed additional right-lateralized activation of the superior temporal gyrus, inferior central operculum, and inferior frontal gyros which may offer an explanation for the clinical observation that patients with non-fluent aphasia due to left hemisphere lesions are able to sing the text of a song while they are unable to speak the same words.

939,936,"Neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence point to a role for the left fusiform gyros in visual word recognition, but the specific nature of this role remains a topic of debate. The aim of this study was to measure the sensitivity of this region to sublexical orthographic structure. We measured blood oxygenation (BOLD) changes in the brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging while fluent readers of English viewed meaningless letter strings. The stimuli varied systematically in their approximation to English orthography, as measured by the probability of occurrence of letters and sequential letter pairs (bigrams) comprising the string. A whole-brain analysis showed a single region in the lateral left fusiform gyrus where BOLD signal increased with letter sequence probability; no other brain region showed this response pattern. The results suggest tuning of this cortical area to letter probabilities as a result of perceptual experience and provide a possible neural correlate for the 'word superiority effect' observed in letter perception research.

941,938,"Neural responses to unfamiliar non-native phonemes varying in the extent to which they can be articulated were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both superior temporal (auditory) and precentral (motor) areas were activated by passive speech perception, and both distinguished non-native from native phonemes, with greater signal change in response to non-native phonemes. Furthermore, speech-responsive motor regions and superior temporal sites were functionally connected. However, only in auditory areas did activity covary with the producibility of non-native phonemes. These data suggest that auditory areas are crucial for the transformation from acoustic signal to phonetic code, but the motor system also plays an active role, which may involve the internal generation of candidate phonemic categorizations. These 'motor' categorizations would then be compared to the acoustic input in auditory areas. The data suggest that speech perception is neither purely sensory nor motor, but rather a sensorimotor process. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

942,939,"Doubts have been cast on the strict dissociation between short- and long-term memory systems. Specifically, several neuroimaging studies have shown that the medial temporal lobe, a region almost invariably associated with long-term memory, is involved in active short-term memory maintenance. Furthermore, a recent study in hippocampally lesioned patients has shown that the hippocampus is critically involved in associating objects and their locations, even when the delay period lasts only 8 s. However, the critical feature that causes the medial temporal lobe, and in particular the hippocampus, to participate in active maintenance is still unknown. This study was designed in order to explore hippocampal involvement in active maintenance of spatial and non-spatial associations. Eighteen participants performed a delayed-match-to-sample task in which they had to maintain either object-location associations, color-number association, single colors, or single locations. Whole-brain activity was measured using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed using a random effects model. Right lateralized hippocampal activity was evident when participants had to maintain object-location associations, but not when they had to maintain object-color associations or single items. The present results suggest a hippocampal involvement in active maintenance when feature combinations that include spatial information have to be maintained online. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

943,940,"People alter their task performance on a trial-to-trial basis, for example after an incongruent trial on tasks involving response conflict. Previous research has found that these adjustments are most robust in the Simon task. One explanation for behavioral adjustments is the conflict-monitoring hypothesis, which posits that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) responds to conflict and that this serves as a signal to recruit other brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to minimize conflict and improve performance. However, another independently supported explanation for behavioral adjustments on the Simon task is the feature integration view, which can account for behavioral adjustments as the result of stimulus repetitions and alternations. Hence, by itself, evidence for behavioral adjustments on the Simon task does not clearly provide evidence for the conflict-monitoring hypothesis. However, the conflict-monitoring hypothesis does predict that behavioral adjustments on the Simon task should involve ACC conflict activity and PFC post-conflict activity. In the current study, consistent with the conflict-monitoring hypothesis, behavioral adjustments in performance on the Simon task were predicted by ACC conflict-related activity. In addition, subsequent behavioral adjustments were associated with PFC activity, with previous trial ACC conflict-related activity predicting greater PFC activity on subsequent trials. These results provide additional evidence that behavioral adjustments on the Simon task are due in part to ACC conflict monitoring and the subsequent recruitment of PFC to minimize conflict.

944,941,"The striatum, a subcortical structure, is the principal target of the neurodegenerative process in Huntington's disease (HD). The measurement of striatal atrophy using the bicaudate ratio on CT scanner images has therefore been used for years to assess disease progression, but this measure only takes into account unidimensional changes in the head of the caudate nucleus. Recently, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), which permits automated statistical comparisons of whole-brain MRI images, has been proposed to quantify striatal atrophy. However, VBM was not originally designed to study subcortical structures, and severe deep brain deformations that occur in HD may hamper the automatic processing of VBM. Here, we validate the use of the optimised protocol of VBM to quantify subcortical atrophy in HD by comparing results obtained with this method to those provided by manual segmentation of subcortical structures. We studied 20 patients with early HD and 12 controls matched for age, sex and handedness using an improved T1-weighted sequence that eased grey matter segmentation. Both manual and automated methods evidenced the dorso-ventral gradient of striatal atrophy, a loss of grey matter in the globus pallidus and the thalamus, and similar correlations between clinical scores and subcortical atrophy. Furthermore, we were able to detect with VBM grey matter loss in the substantia nigra, the hypothalamus, the amygdala, the insular cortex and the premotor and sensorimotor cortices.

945,942,"When listening to music, we often spontaneously synchronize our body movements to a rhythm's beat (e.g. tapping our feet). The goals of this study were to determine how features of a rhythm such as metric structure, can facilitate motor responses, and to elucidate the neural correlates of these auditory-motor interactions using fMRI. Five variants of an isochronous rhythm were created by increasing the contrast in sound amplitude between accented and unaccented tones, progressively highlighting the rhythm's metric structure. Subjects tapped in synchrony to these rhythms, and as metric saliency increased across the five levels, louder tones evoked longer tap durations with concomitant increases in the BOLD response at auditory and dorsal premotor cortices. The functional connectivity between these regions was also modulated by the stimulus manipulation. These results show that metric organization, as manipulated via intensity accentuation, modulates motor behavior and neural responses in auditory and dorsal premotor cortex. Auditory-motor interactions may take place at these regions with the dorsal premotor cortex interfacing sensory cues with temporally organized movement.

946,943,"Axonal degeneration of white matter fibers is a key consequence of neuronal or axonal injury. It is characterized by a series of time-related events with initial axonal membrane collapse followed by myelin degradation being its major hallmarks. Standard imaging cannot differentiate these phenomena, which would be useful for clinical investigations of degeneration, regeneration and plasticity. Animal models suggest that diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is capable of making such distinction. The applicability of this technique in humans would permit inferences on white matter microanatomy using a non-invasive technique. The surgical bisection of the anterior 2/3 of the corpus callosum for the palliative treatment of certain types of epilepsy serves as a unique opportunity to assess this method in humans. DTI was performed on three epilepsy patients before corpus callosotomy and at two time points (1 week and 2-4 months) after surgery. Tractography was used to define voxels of interest for analysis of mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and eigenvalues. Diffusion anisotropy was reduced in a spatially dependent manner in the germ and body of the corpus callosum at I week and remained low 2-4 months after the surgery. Decreased anisotropy at 1 week was due to a reduction in parallel diffusivity (consistent with axonal fragmentation), whereas at 2-4 months, it was due to an increase in perpendicular diffusivity (consistent with myelin degradation). DTI is capable of non-invasively detecting, staging and following the microstructural degradation of white matter following axonal injury. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, evolving white matter injury within the optic nerves of mice with retinal ischemia was examined by in vivo and ex vivo measurements of A(parallel to) and lambda(perpendicular to). The results show that at 3 days after retinal ischemia, a 33% decrease in vivo and a 38% decrease ex vivo in lambda(parallel to) without change in lambda(perpendicular to) was observed in the injured optic nerve compared to the control, suggestive of axonal damage without myelin injury. At 14 days, both in vivo and ex vivo measured lambda(perpendicular to) increased significantly to 220-240% of the control level in the injured optic nerve suggestive of myelin damage. In contrast, the axonal injury that was clearly detected in vivo as a significantly decreased All (33% decrease) was not as clearly detected by ex vivo lambda(parallel to) (17% decrease). The current findings suggest that ex vivo lambda(perpendicular to) is comparable to in vivo lambda(perpendicular to) in detecting myelin injury. However, the structural changes resulting from axonal damage causing the decreased in vivo All may not be preserved ex vivo in the fixed tissues. Despite the accurate depiction of the pathology using lambda(parallel to) and lambda(perpendicular to) in vivo, the use of ex vivo lambda(parallel to) to extrapolate the status of axonal injury in vivo would require further investigation.

This perceptual illusion, the 'face composite effect', is taken as strong evidence that faces are processed as a whole rather than as a collection of independent features. To test the hypothesis that areas responding preferentially to faces in the human brain represent faces holistically, we recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an adaptation paradigm with the composite face illusion. In both the middle fusiform gyrus (MFG) and the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), we observed a significantly larger response to the same top face when it was aligned with different bottom parts than with the same bottom part, with a most robust effect in the right middle fusiform gyrus. This difference was not found when the top and the bottom face parts were spatially misaligned or when the faces were presented upside-down. These findings indicate that facial features are integrated into holistic face representations in areas of the human visual cortex responding preferentially to faces. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

951,948,"Alexithymic individuals have difficulty in recognizing and describing emotions in themselves. We investigated the neuronal basis of mentalizing in alexithymia to determine whether there is a common neuronal substrate associated with knowing the mental states of the self and others. Individuals high in alexithymia (n = 16) and low in alexithymia (n = 14) were selected from a pool of 310 college students using a combination of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Structured Interview version of the Beth Israel Questionnaire (SIBIQ). We compared the two groups on psychological measures, including ratings of mentalizing and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and regional brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a mentalizing animation task. The results for both groups showed activation in regions associated with mentalizing: medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC), temporo-parietal junctions (TPJ), and the temporal pole (TP). Alexithymics had lower mentalizing and IRI perspective-taking scores and less activation in the right MPFC. Activity in the MPFC was positively correlated with the mentalizing score and the IRI perspective-taking score. Although there were no group differences in cerebral activity in the TPJ and the TP, the activity in the right TP had a positive correlation with mentalizing and IRI personal distress scores. These results suggest that alexithymic individuals have an impairment in mentalizing associated with an inability to take the perspective of others. Thus, the skills involved in comprehending the self and others are inter-related and play an important role in emotion regulation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

952,949,"In the complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), several theories proposed the existence of pathophysiological mechanisms of central origin. Recent studies highlighted a smaller representation of the CRPS-affected hand on the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) during nonpainful stimulation of the affected side. We addressed the question whether reorganizational changes can also be found in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Moreover, we investigated whether cortical changes might be accompanied by perceptual changes within associated skin territories. Seventeen patients with CRPS of one upper limb without the presence of peripheral nerve injuries (type 1) were subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during electrical stimulation of both index fingers (IFs) in order to assess hemodynamic signals of the IF representation in SI and SII. As a marker of tactile perception, we tested 2-point discrimination thresholds on the tip of both IFs. Cortical signals within SI and SII were significantly reduced contralateral to the CRPS-affected IF as compared to the ipsilateral side and to the representation of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In parallel, discrimination thresholds of the CRPS-affected IF were significantly higher, giving rise to an impairment of tactile perception within the corresponding skin territory. Mean sustained, but not current pain levels were correlated with the amount of sensory impairment and the reduction in signal strength. We conclude that patterns of cortical reorganization in SI and SII seem to parallel impaired tactile discrimination. Furthermore, the amount of reorganization and tactile impairment appeared to be linked to characteristics of CRPS pain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

954,951,"Allocation of attentional resources to portions of the available sensory input can be regulated by bottom-up processes, i.e., spontaneous orientation towards an oncoming stimulus (stimulus-driven attention), and by top-down processes, i.e., intentionally and driven by knowledge, expectation and goals. The present study aimed at advancing the understanding of brain networks mediating bottom-up and top-down control of visuospatial attention by employing a paradigm that parametrically varied demands on these two processes. Spatial predictability of peripheral targets was parametrically varied by centrally cueing one, two, three or four of four possible locations. Reaction time decreased linearly with more precise valid cueing of the target location and increased with more precise invalid cueing. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enabled measurement of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to cues and to targets. A mostly left-hemispheric network consisting of left intraparietal sulcus, inferior and superior parietal lobule, bilateral precuneus, middle frontal gyri including superior frontal sulci, and middle occipital gyri displayed BOLD responses to cues that increased linearly with more precise spatial cueing, indicating engagement by top-down spatial selective attention. In contrast, bilateral temporoparietal junction, cingulate gyrus, right precentral gyrus and anterior and posterior insula, bilateral fusiform gyri, lingual gyri and caucus displayed BOLD responses to targets that increased with their spatial unpredictability, indicating engagement by stimulus-driven orienting. The results suggest two largely dissociated neural networks mediating top - down and bottom - up control of visuospatial selective attention. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated, for the first time, the abstract linking of linguistic and odour information using modern neuro-imaging techniques (functional MRI). Subjects passively read odour-related words ('garlic', 'cinnamon', 'jasmine') and neutral language items. The odour-related terms elicited activation in the primary olfactory cortex, which include the piriform cortex and the amygdala. Pur results suggest the activation of widely distributed cortical cell assemblies in the processing of olfactory words. These distributed neuron populations extend into language areas but also reach some parts of the olfactory system. These distributed neural systems may be the basis of the processing of language elements, their related conceptual and semantic information and the associated sensory information.

956,953,"Whether human infants perceive televised stimuli in the same way to live stimuli largely remains unknown. Action observation, which has been extensively confirmed to elicit activation of internal motor representation, provides a promising framework for investigating this issue. This 'mirror-matching' property has been found in the monkey premotor cortex as Well as the premotor and primary motor cortices in human adults. Although larger activation in observing a live action compared to a televised action in adult subjects has been reported, it is unknown whether the same neural response is obtained from human infants. To address this issue, we first measured the activity of motor areas in adult subjects while viewing either a live or televised action of other people by using near-infrared spectroscopy. The motor areas that were activated when the subject themselves performed an action were also activated during action observation in the live setting, while this was not evident in the TV setting. We then conducted qualitatively the same experiment with 6- to 7-month-old infants. The infant's motor areas were significantly activated when observing a live person performing an action. Although we also found activation in the same area during action observation in the TV setting, the difference in activity between action observation and object-motion observation was significant only in the live setting. Our results are the first to demonstrate activation in motor areas during action observation in human infants. We suggest that human brain responds differently to the real world and the virtual world. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The most common known cerebral abnormality among preterm infants at term equivalent age is a diffuse white matter abnormality seen on magnetic resonance (MR) images. It occurs with a similar prevalence to subsequent impairment, but its effect on developing neural systems is unknown. MR images were obtained at term equivalent age from 62 infants born at 24-33 completed weeks gestation and 12 term born controls. Tissue damage was quantified using diffusion-weighted imaging, and deformation-based morphometry was used to make a non-subjective survey of the whole brain to identify significant cerebral morphological alterations associated with preterm birth and with diffuse white matter injury. Preterm infants at term equivalent age had reduced thalamic and lentiform volumes without evidence of acute injury in these regions (t = 5.81, P < 0.05), and these alterations were more marked with increasing prematurity (t = 7.13, P < 0.05 for infants born at less than 28 weeks) and in infants with diffuse white matter injury (t = 6.43, P < 0.05). The identification of deep grey matter growth failure in association with diffuse white matter injury suggests that white matter injury is not an isolated phenomenon, but rather, it is associated with the maldevelopment of remote structures. This could be mediated by a disturbance to corticothalamic connectivity during a critical period in cerebral development.

Here, we used high field functional MRI in humans to examine the neural basis of this multisensory perceptual illusion. We show that activity in retinotopic visual cortex is increased by the presence of concurrent auditory stimulation, irrespective of any illusory perception. However, when concurrent auditory stimulation gave rise to illusory visual perception, activity in VI was enhanced, despite auditory and visual stimulation being unchanged. These findings confirm that responses in human V1 can be altered by sound and show that they reflect subjective perception rather than the physically present visual stimulus. Moreover, as the right superior temporal sulcus and superior colliculus were also activated by illusory visual perception, together with VI, they provide a potential neural substrate for the generation of this multisensory illusion.

963,960,"This 3-T fMRI study investigates brain regions similarly and differentially involved with listening and covert production of singing relative to speech. Given the greater use of auditory-motor self-monitoring and imagery with respect to consonance in singing, brain regions involved with these processes are predicted to be differentially active for singing more than for speech. The stimuli consisted of six Japanese songs. A block design was employed in which the tasks for the subject were to listen passively to singing of the song lyrics, passively listen to speaking of the song lyrics, covertly sing the song lyrics visually presented, covertly speak the song lyrics visually presented, and to rest. The conjunction of passive listening and covert production tasks used in this study allow for general neural processes underlying both perception and production to be discerned that are not exclusively a result of stimulus induced auditory processing nor to low level articulatory motor control. Brain regions involved with both perception and production for singing as well as speech were found to include the left planum temporale/superior temporal parietal region, as well as left and right premotor cortex, lateral aspect of the VI lobule of posterior cerebellum, anterior superior temporal gyrus, and planum polare. Greater activity for the singing over the speech condition for both the listening and covert production tasks was found in the right planum temporale. Greater activity in brain regions involved with consonance, orbitofrontal cortex (listening task), subcallosal cingulate (covert production task) were also present for singing over speech. The results are consistent with the PT mediating representational transformation across auditory and motor domains in response to consonance for singing over that of speech. Hemispheric laterality was assessed by paired t tests between active voxels in the contrast of interest relative to the left-right flipped contrast of interest calculated from images normalized to the left-right reflected template. Consistent with some hypotheses regarding hemispheric specialization, a pattern of differential laterality for speech over singing (both covert production and listening tasks) occurs in the left temporal lobe, whereas, singing over speech (listening task only) occurs in right temporal lobe.

First, individual differences in the amount of regional gray matter volumes across the entire brain were correlated with eight cognitive tests showing distinguishable g-involvement. Results show that increasing g-involvement of individual tests was associated with increased gray matter volume throughout the brain. Second, it is shown that two prototypical measures of verbal and nonverbal g (i.e., vocabulary and block design) correlate with the amount of regional gray matter across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, suggesting that the general factor of intelligence relates to areas distributed across the brain as opposed to the view that g derives exclusively from the frontal lobes.

Cortical thickness was measured using a direct method for calculating the distance between corresponding vertices from inner and outer cortical surfaces. We normalized cortical surfaces using 2-D surface registration and performed diffusion smoothing to reduce the variability of folding patterns and to increase the power of the statistical analysis. In stereotaxic space, significant localized cortical thickening in women was found extensively in frontal, parietal and occipital lobes, including the superior frontal gyros (SFG), superior parietal gyrus (SPG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and postcentral gyros (PoCG) in the left hemisphere and mostly in the parietal lobe, including the SPG in the right hemisphere. In the temporal lobe, small regions of the left and right caudal superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the left temporal pole showed significantly greater cortical thickness in women. The temporal lobe shows relatively less significant thickening than other lobes in both hemispheres. In native space, significantly greater cortical thickness in women was detected in left parietal region, including SPG and PoCG. No significant local increases of cortical thickness were observed in men in both spaces. These findings suggest statistically significant cortical thickening in women in localized anatomical regions, which is consistent with several previous studies and may support a hypothesis of sexual dimorphism.

The results at the group level showed good reliability in terms of the single measure ICCs (up to 0.84) and excellent reproducibility quantified by R-QUANTITY and R-OVERLAP (up to 96% of the quantity and the location were reproducible), whereas the results at the single subjects' level were mediocre.

The temporal sequence ('when') and source localization ('where') of event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by fearful and happy facial expressions, compared to neutral control expressions, were examined for 219 healthy subjects. We scored ERPs over occipito-temporal sites (N80, 50-120 ms; P120 80-180 ms; N170, 120-220 ms; P230, 180-290 ms; N250, 230-35 ms) and their polarity-reversed counterparts over medial sites (P80, 40-120 ms; N120, 80-150 ms; VPP, 120-220 ms; N200,150-280 ms; P300, 280-450 ms). In addition to scoring peak amplitude and latency, the anatomical sources of activity were determined using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Fearful faces were distinguished by persistent increases in positivity, associated with a dynamical shift from temporo-frontal (first 120 ms) to more distributed cortical sources (120-220 ms) and back (220-450 ms). By contrast, expressions of happiness produced a discrete enhancement of negativity, later in the time course (230-350 ms) and localized to the fusiform region of the temporal cortex. In common, fear and happiness modulated the face-related N170, and produced generally greater right hemisphere activity. These findings support the proposal that fear signals are given precedence in the neural processing systems, such that processing of positive signals may be suppressed until vigilance for potential danger is completed. While fear may be processed via parallel pathways (one initiated prior to structural encoding), neural systems supporting positively valenced input may be more localized and rely on structural encoding.

973,970,"The human infant is particularly immature at birth and brain maturation, with the myelination of white matter fibers, is protracted until adulthood. Diffusion tensor imaging offers the possibility to describe non invasively the fascicles spatial organization at an early stage and to follow the cerebral maturation with quantitative parameters that might be correlated with behavioral development. Here, we assessed the feasibility to study the organization and maturation of major white matter bundles in eighteen 1- to 4-month-old healthy infants, using a specific acquisition protocol customized to the immature brain (with 15 orientations of the diffusion gradients and a 700 s mm(-2) b factor). We were able to track most of the main fascicles described at later ages despite the low anisotropy of the infant white matter, using the FACT algorithm. This mapping allows us to propose a new method of quantification based on reconstructed tracts, split between specific regions, which should be more sensitive to specific changes in a bundle than the conventional approach, based on regions-of-interest. We observed variations in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity over the considered developmental period in most bundles (corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles, cortico-spinal tract, spinothalamic tract, capsules, radiations, longitudinal and uncinate fascicles, cingulum). The results are in good agreement with the known stages of white matter maturation and myelination, and the proposed approach might provide important insights on brain development.

974,971,"Spatial specificity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals to sub-millimeter functional architecture remains controversial. To investigate this issue, high-resolution fMRI in response to visual stimulus was obtained in isoflurane-anesthetized cats at 9.4 T using conventional gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo (SE) techniques; blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted data were acquired without and with injection of 10 mg Fe/kg monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (MION), respectively. Studies after MION injection at two SE times show that the T-2' contribution to SE fMRI is minimal. GE and SE BOLD changes were spread across the cortical layers. GE and SE CBV-weighted fMRI responses peaked at the middle cortical layer, which has the highest experimentally-determined microvascular volume; full-width at half-maximum was < 1.0 mm. Parenchymal sensitivity of GE CBV-weighted fMRI was similar to 3 times higher than that of SE CBV-weighted fMRI and similar to 1.5 times higher than that of BOLD fMRI. It is well known that GE CBV-weighted fMRI detects a volume change in vessels of all sizes, while SE CBV-weighted fMRI is heavily weighted toward microvascular changes. Peak CBV change of 10% at the middle of the cortex in GE measurements was 1.8 times higher than that in SE measurements, indicating that CBV changes occur predominantly for vasculature connecting the intracortical vessels and capillaries. Our data supports the notion of laminar-dependent CBV regulation at a sub-millimeter scale. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

977,974,"The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigates modifications of brain activation patterns related to the training of two different arithmetic operations, multiplication and subtraction. Healthy young adults were trained in five sessions to answer multiplication and subtraction problems. In the following fMRI session, trained and new untrained problems closely matched for difficulty were presented in blocked order. Contrasts between untrained and trained operations showed stronger activation of inferior frontal and parietal regions, especially along the banks of the intraparietal sulcus. The reverse contrasts, trained minus untrained operations, yielded significantly higher activation in the left angular gyros for multiplication but no significantly activated area for subtraction. This suggests that training leads to a reduction of general purpose processes, such as working memory and executive control in both operations, indicated by the decrease of activation in inferior frontal areas. For multiplication, however, the increase of activation in the left angular gyrus indicates a switching of cognitive processes. Trained subtraction therefore seems to lead to faster and more efficient strategies, while trained multiplication showed a shift from quantity-based processing (supported by the areas along the intraparietal sulci) to more automatic retrieval (supported by the left angular gyros). The same training method caused changes in brain activation patterns that depended on the given operation. The effects of learning on the brain therefore seem not only to depend on the method of learning but also on its content. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",How specifically do we learn?

Fifteen never-medicated, first episode schizophrenia patients, and 24 matched healthy individuals performed eye movement tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. For both visually guided saccade and smooth pursuit paradigms, schizophrenia patients demonstrated reduced activation in sensorimotor areas supporting eye movement control, including the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, and parietal and cingulate cortex. The same findings were observed for an oculomotor delayed response paradigm used to assess spatial working memory, during which schizophrenia patients also had reduced activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, only minimal group differences in activation were found during a manual motor task. These results suggest a system-level dysfunction of cortical sensorimotor regions supporting oculomotor function, as well as in areas of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that support spatial working memory. These findings indicate that a generalized rather than localized pattern of neocortical dysfunction is present early in the course of schizophrenia and is related to deficits in the sensorimotor and cognitive control of eye movement activity.

979,976,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is showing increased utility in examining medial temporal lobe atrophy and its relationship to memory performance in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied 56 AD patients and 42 older healthy subjects with neuropsychological assessment and MRI. Hippocampal and amygdaloid volumes (normalized to intracranial volume) were contrasted between AD patients and healthy controls and correlated with neuropsychological performance. Comparisons between AD patients and healthy controls revealed highly significant differences in the normalized volume of hippocampus and amygdala by analysis of covariance. Group differences tended to be at least as large for amygdaloid as hippocampal volume, including when the subset of AD patients with the mildest symptoms was considered separately. Within the AD group, performance on the Memory-Orientation subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog) was significantly correlated with normalized amygdaloid volume but not with normalized hippocampal volume. Other ADAS-Cog subscales (Language, Praxis) were uncorrelated with either volume. In the healthy control sample, neither hippocampal nor amygdaloid volumes were significant predictors of any neuropsychological measure.

Among patients, but not healthy controls, performance on the PASAT, a comprehensive measure of cognitive function and reference task for the cognitive evaluation of MS-patients, correlated with global grey matter volume as well as with grey matter volume in regions associated with working memory and executive function, including bilateral prefrontal cortex, precentral gyros and superior parietal cortex as well as right cerebellum. Compared to healthy subjects, patients showed a volume reduction in left temporal and prefrontal cortex, recently identified as areas predominantly affected by diffuse brain atrophy in MS. A comparison of low performers in the patient group with their matched control subjects showed more extensive and bilateral temporal and frontal volume reductions as well as bilateral parietal volume loss, compatible with the progression of atrophy found in more advanced MS-patients.

981,978,"Semantic dementia (SD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are both disorders in which early pathology affects the temporal lobe Net they produce distinct syndromes of declarative memory impairment-loss of established semantic knowledge with relatively preserved episodic memory in the former and the converse in the latter. Groups with mild SD and mild AD who showed a double dissociation in these two aspects of declarative memory were studied-the SD group's episodic memory and the AD group's semantic knowledge each being comparable to controls. Positron emission tomography and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging were used to map deficits in regional cerebral metabolic rate and mesial temporal lobe MTL atrophy, respectively. Episodic memory impairment in AD was associated with dysfunction of an integrated network (mesial temporal lobe, mamillary bodies, dorsomesial thalamus and posterior cingulate). Semantic memory impairment in SD was associated with bilateral rostra] temporal lobe hypometabolism. The SD group had comparable MTL atrophy and hypometabolism to that found in AD but the remainder of their limbic-diencephalic network was preserved suggesting that the latter explains their ability to acquire new episodic memories. The results challenge the view that amnesia in early AD can be explained by the degree of MTL damage alone while showing that semantic impairment can occur with damage restricted to the rostral temporal lobes.

982,979,"The specific role of particular cerebral regions with regard to executive functions remains elusive. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to segregate different network components underlying the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a test widely applied clinically to assess executive abilities. Three different test variants of the WCST, differing in task complexity (A > B > C), were contrasted with a high-level baseline condition (HLB). Cognitive subcomponents were extracted in a serial subtraction approach (A-C, A-B, B-C). Imaging data were further subjected to a correlational analysis with individual behavioral parameters. Contrasting A with the HLB revealed the entire neural network underlying WCST performance, including frontoparietal regions and the striatum. Further analysis showed that, within this network, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex related to simple working memory operations, while right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex related to more complex/manipulative working memory operations. The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the temporoparietal junction bilaterally represented an attentional network for error detection. In contrast, activation of the caudal ACC and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with increased attentional control in the context of increasing demands of working memory and cognitive control. Nonfrontal activations were found to be related to (uninstructed relative to instructed) set-shifting (cerebellum) and working memory representations (superior parietal cortex, retrosplenium). The data provide neural correlates for the different cognitive components involved in the WCST. They support a central role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in executive working memory operations and cognitive control functions but also suggest a functional dissociation of the rostral and caudal ACC in the implementation of attentional control.

983,980,"Using magnetic resonance imaging and well-validated computational cortical pattern matching methods in a large and well-matched sample of healthy subjects (n = 60), we analyzed the regional specificity of gender-related cortical thickness differences across the lateral and medial cortices at submillimeter resolution. To establish the influences of brain size correction on gender effects, comparisons were performed with and without applying affine transformations to scale each image volume to a template. We revealed significantly greater cortical thickness in women compared to men, after correcting for individual differences in brain size, while no significant regional thickness increases were observed in males. The pattern and direction of the results were similar without brain size correction, although effects were less pronounced and a small cortical region in the lateral temporal lobes showed greater thickness in males. Our gender-specific findings support a dimorphic organization in male and female brains that appears to involve the architecture of the cortical mantle and that manifests as increased thickness in female brains. This sexual dimorphism favoring women, even without correcting for brain size, may have functional significance and possibly account for gender-specific abilities and/or behavioral differences between sexes.",Gender effects on cortical thickness and the influence of scaling,2006,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,Article,16124013,['nomethod'],1.8,nomethod
984,981,"Digital and print brain atlases have been used with success to help ill the planning of neurosurgical interveritions. In this paper, a technique presented for the creation of a brain atlas of the basal ganglia and the thalamus derived from serial histological data. Photographs of coronal histological sections were digitized and anatomical structures were manually segmented. A slice-to-slice nonlinear registration technique was used to correct for spatial distortions introduced into the histological data set at the time of acquisition. Since the histological data were acquired without any anatomical reference (e.g., block-face imaging, post-mortem MR]), this registration technique was optimized to use an error metric which calculates a nonlinear transformation minimizing the mean distance between the segmented contours between adjacent pairs of slices in the data set. A voxel-by-voxel intensity correction field was also estimated for each slice to correct for lighting and staining inhomogencity. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) histological volume can be viewed in transverse and sagittal directions in addition to the original coronal. Nonlinear transformations used to correct for spatial distortions of the histological data were applied to the segmented structure contours. These contours were then tessellated to create three-dimensional geometric objects representing the different anatomic regions in register with the histological volumes. This yields two alternate representations (one histological and one geometric) of the atlas. To register the atlas to a standard reference MR volume created from the average of 27 T1-weighted MR volumes, a pseudo-MRI was created by setting the intensity of each anatomical region defined in the geometric atlas to match the intensity of the corresponding region of the reference MR volume. This allowed the estimation of a 3D nonlinear transformation using a correlation based registration scheme to fit the atlas to the reference MRI. The result of this procedure is a contiguous 3D histological volume, a set of 3D objects defining the basal ganglia and thalamus, both of which are registered to a standard MRI data set, for use for neurosurgical planning.

985,982,"Bipolar disorder (BD) has been associated with abnormalities of brain structure. Specifically, in vivo volumetric MRI and/or post mortern studies of BID have reported abnormalities of gray matter (GM) volume in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, hippocampal subiculum and ventral striatum. These structures share anatomical connections with each other and form part of a ""visceromotor"" network modulating emotional behavior. Areas of the lateral orbital, superior temporal and posterior cingulate cortices project to this network, but morphometric abnormalities in these areas have not been established in BD. The current study assessed tissue volumes within these areas in 131) using MRI and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). MRI images were obtained from 36 BD subjects and 65 healthy controls. To account for possible neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of psychotropic medications, BID subjects were divided into medicated and unmedicated groups. Images were segmented into tissue compartments, which were examined on a voxel-wise basis to determine the location and extent of morphometric changes. The GM was reduced in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and superior temporal gyrus of unmedicated BD subjects relative to medicated BD subjects and in the lateral orbital cortex of medicated BD subjects relative to controls. White matter (WM) was increased in the orbital and posterior cingulate cortices, which most likely reflected alterations in gyral morphology resulting from the reductions in the associated GM. The morphometric abnormalities in the posterior cingulate, superior temporal and lateral orbital cortices in BD support the hypothesis that the extended network of neuroanatomical structures subserving visceromotor regulation contains structural alterations in BID. Additionally, localization of morphometric abnormalities to areas known to exhibit increased metabolism in depression supports the hypothesis that repeated stress and elevated glucocorticoid secretion may result in neuroplastic changes in BD.

986,983,"To examine the effect of gender on regional brain activity, we utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a motor task and three cognitive tasks; a word generation task, a spatial attention task, and a working memory task in healthy male (n = 23) and female (it = 10) volunteers. Functional data were examined for group differences both in the number of pixels activated, and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) magnitude during each task. Males had a significantly greater mean activation than females in the working memory task with a greater number of pixels being activated in the right superior parietal gyrus and right inferior occipital gyrus, and a greater BOLD magnitude occurring in the left inferior parietal lobe. However, despite these fMRI changes, there were no significant differences between males and females on cognitive performance of the task. In contrast, in the spatial attention task, men performed better at this task than women, but there were no significant functional differences between the two groups. In the word generation task, there were no external measures of performance, but in the functional measurements, males had a significantly greater mean activation than females, where males had a significantly greater BOLD signal magnitude in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the right inferior parietal lobe, and the cingulate. In neither of the motor tasks (right or left hand) did males and females perform differently. Our fMRI findings during the motor tasks were a greater mean BOLD signal magnitude in males in the right hand motor task, compared to females where males had an increased BOLD signal magnitude in the right inferior parietal gyrus and in the left inferior frontal gyrus. In conclusion, these results demonstrate differential patterns of activation in males and females during a variety of cognitive tasks, even though performance in these tasks may not vary, and also that variability in performance may not be reflected in differences in brain activation. These results suggest that in functional imaging studies in clinical populations it may be sensible to examine each sex independently until this effect is more fully understood.

Conventional analysis of fMRI data revealed activation within the right posterior middle temporal gyrus and bilateral inferior frontal cortex during evaluation of affective prosody and left temporal pole, orbitofrontal, and medial superior frontal cortex during judgment of affective semantics. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in combination with Bayes factors was used to compare competing neurophysiological models with different intrinsic connectivity structures and input regions within the network of brain regions underlying comprehension of affecfive prosody. Comparison on group level revealed superiority of a model in which the right temporal cortex serves as input region as compared to models in which one of the frontal areas is assumed to receive external inputs. Moreover, models with parallel information conductance from the right temporal cortex were superior to models in which the two frontal lobes accomplish serial processing steps. In conclusion, connectivity analysis supports the view that evaluation of affective prosody requires prior analysis of acoustic features within the temporal and that transfer of information from the temporal cortex to the frontal lobes occurs via parallel pathways.

991,988,"We describe a novel spatial filtering approach to the localization of cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements. The synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) minimum-variance beam-former algorithm was used to compute spatial filters three-dimensionally over the entire brain from single trial neuromagnetic recordings of subjects performing self-paced index finger movements. Images of instantaneous source power (""event-related SAM"") computed at selected latencies revealed activation of multiple cortical motor areas prior to and following left and right index finger movements in individual subjects, even in the presence of low-frequency noise (e.g., eye movements). A slow premovement motor field (MF) reaching maximal amplitude similar to 50 ms prior to movement onset was localized to the hand area of contralateral precentral gyrus, followed by activity in the contralateral postcentral gyrus at 40 ms, corresponding to the first movement-evoked field (MER). A novel finding was a second activation of the precentral gyrus at a latency of similar to 150 ms, corresponding to the second movement-evoked field (MEFII). Group averaging of spatially normalized images indicated additional premovement activity in the ipsilateral precentral gyrus and the left interior parietal cortex for both left and right fin-er movements. Weaker activations were also observed in bilateral premotor areas and the supplementary motor area. These results show that event-related beamforming provides a robust method for studying complex patterns of time-locked cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements, and offers a new approach for the localization of multiple cortical sources derived from neuromagnetic recordings in single subject and group data.",Spatiotemporal mapping of cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements using an event-related beamforming approach,2006,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,Article,16037985,['nomethod'],2.25,nomethod

993,990,"Understanding the neurobiological substrates of self-recognition yields important insight into socially and clinically critical cognitive functions such as theory of mind. Experimental evidence suggests that right frontal and parietal lobes preferentially process self-referent information. Recognition of one's own face is an important parameter of self-recognition, but well-controlled experimental data on the brain substrates of self-face recognition is limited. The goal of this study was to characterize the activation specific to self-face in comparison with control conditions of two levels of familiarity: unknown unfamiliar face and the more stringent control of a personally familiar face. We studied 12 healthy volunteers who made ""unknown,"" ""familiar,"" and ""self"" judgments about photographs of three types of faces: six different novel faces, a personally familiar face (participant's fraternity brother), and their own face during an event-related functional MR1 (fMRI) experiment. Contrasting unknown faces with baseline showed activation of the inferior occipital lobe, which supports previous findings suggesting the presence of a generalized face-processing area within the inferior occipital-temporal region. Activation in response to a familiar face, when contrasted with an unknown face, invoked insula, middle temporal, inferior parietal, and medial frontal lobe activation, which is consistent with an existing hypothesis suggesting familiar face recognition taps neural substrates that are different from those involved in general facial processing. Brain response to self-face, when contrasted with familiar face, revealed activation in the right superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal and inferior parietal lobes, and left middle temporal gyrus. The contrast familiar vs. self produced activation only in the anterior cingulate gyrus. Our results support the existence of a bilateral network for both perceptual and executive aspects of self-face processing that cannot be accounted for by a simple hemispheric dominance model. This network is similar to those implicated in social cognition, mirror neuron matching, and face-name matching. Our findings also show that some regions of the medial frontal and parietal lobes are specifically activated by familiar faces but not unknown or self-faces, indicating that these regions may serve as markers of face familiarity and that the differences between activation associated with self-face recognition and familiar face recognition are subtle and appear to be localized to lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal regions.",Neural substrates for functionally discriminating self-face from personally familiar faces,2006,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,Article,16035037,['fMRI'],2.25,fMRI

In this study, we investigated hemodynamic changes in the dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC) (luring video games as one of daily amusements, using near infrared spectroscopy technique. It was previously reported that oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) in adults' DPFC decreased during prolonged game playing time. In the present study, we examined whether similar changes were observed in children. Twenty children (7-14 years old) participated in our study, but only 13 of them were eventually subject to analysis. They played one or two commercially available video games; namely a fighting and a puzzle game, for 5 min. We used changes in concentration of oxyHb as an indicator of brain activity and consequently, most of the children exhibited a sustained game-related oxyHb decrease in DPFC. Decrease patterns of oxyHb in children during video game playing time did not differ from those in adults. There was no significant correlation between ages or game performances and changes in oxyHb. These findings suggest that game-related oxyHb decrease in DPFC is a common phenomenon to adults and children at least older than 7 years old, and we suggest that this probably results from attention demand from the video games rather than from subject's age and performance.

Ten healthy female subjects were presented with affectively positive, neutral, and negative pictures in each of an Attending and Suppression task. Regional cerebral blood-flow changes were measured using O-15-water positron emission tomography, and autonomic (heart rate: HR, skin conductance response: SCR) and endocrine (adrenocorticotropic hormone: ACTH) indices were measured during both tasks.

In the Attending task, activation in the amygdala and MOFC positively correlated with magnitudes of the SCR and ACTH responses. Emotion suppression elicited enhancement of SCR and the strength of the effect positively correlated with activation in the MOFC. These results suggest that the MOFC plays a pivotal role in top-down regulation of peripheral physiological responses accompanying emotional experiences. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Then, gray matter density in patients with PTSD and control groups was compared by using a VBM approach in SPM2. Group analysis was thresholded at P < 0.001, uncorrected, at the voxel level. The following three regions of reduced gray matter volume were found in patients with PTSD compared with controls: left hippocampus, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral insular cortex. It was concluded that there are structural abnormalities of the hippocampus, the ACC and the insular cortex in patients with PTSD due to fire. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

999,996,"Effective fear processing relies on the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Post-trauma reactions provide a compelling model for examining how the heightened experience of fear impacts these systems. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with excessive amygdala and a lack of MPFC activity in response to nonconscious facial signals of fear, but responses to consciously processed facial fear stimuli have not been examined. We used functional MRI to elucidate the effect of trauma reactions on amygdala-MPFC function during an overt fear perception task. Subjects with PTSD (n = 13) and matched non-traumatized healthy subjects (it = 13) viewed 15 blocks of eight fearful face stimuli alternating pseudorandomly with 15 blocks of neutral faces (stimulus duration 500 ms; ISI 767 ms). We used random effects analyses in SPM2 to examine within- and between-group differences in the MPFC and amygdala search regions of interest. Time series data were used to examine amygdala-MPFC associations and changes across the first (Early) versus second (Late) phases of the experiment. Relative to non-traumatized subjects, PTSD subjects showed a marked bilateral reduction in MPFC activity (in particular, right anterior cingulate cortex, ACC), which showed a different Early-Late pattern to non-traumatized subjects and was more pronounced with greater trauma impact and symptomatology. PTSD subjects also showed a small but significant enhancement in left amygdala activity, most apparent during the Late phase, but reduction in Early right amygdala response. Over the time course, trauma was related to a distinct pattern of ACC and amygdala connections. The findings suggest that major life trauma may disrupt the normal pattern of medial prefrontal and amygdala regulation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1001,998,"We investigated the human face specificity by comparing the effects of inversion and contrast reversal, two manipulations known to disrupt configural face processing, on human and ape faces, isolated eyes and objects, using event-related potentials. The face sensitive marker, N170, was shortest to human faces and delayed by inversion and contrast reversal for all categories and not only for human faces. Most importantly, N170 to inverted or contrast-reversed faces was not different from N170 to eyes that did not differ across manipulations. This suggests the disruption of facial configuration by these manipulations isolates the eye region from the face context, to which eye neurons respond. Our data suggest that (i) the inversion and contrast reversal effects on N170 latency are not specific to human faces and (ii) the similar increase of N170 amplitude by inversion and contrast reversal is unique to human faces and is driven by the eye region. Thus, while inversion and contrast reversal effects on N170 latency are not category-specific, their effects on amplitude are face-specific and reflect mainly the contribution of the eye region.

The present study aimed to identify changes in brain activation following cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in subjects suffering from specific phobia. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain activation to spider videos was measured in 28 spider phobic and 14 healthy control subjects. Phobics were randomly assigned to a therapy-group (TG) and a waiting-list control group (WG). Both groups of phobics were scanned twice. Between scanning sessions, CBT was given to the TG. Before therapy, brain activation did not differ between both groups of phobics. As compared to control subjects, phobics showed greater responses to spider vs. control videos in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). CBT strongly reduced phobic symptoms in the TG while the WG remained behaviorally unchanged. In the second scanning session, a significant reduction of hyperactivity in the insula and ACC was found in the TG compared to the WG. These results propose that increased activation in the insula and ACC is associated with specific phobia, whereas an attenuation of these brain responses correlates with successful therapeutic intervention.

Detailed time courses of brain activation in the bipolar disorder group were investigated using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (LAIRS), a recently developed functional neuroimaging technology with a high time resolution, and were compared with those in the major depression and healthy control groups. Seventeen patients with bipolar disorder, 11 equally depressed patients with major depression, and 17 healthy controls participated in the study. Changes in oxy hemoglobin concentration ([oxy-Hb]) during cognitive and motor tasks were monitored using frontal and temporal probes of two sets of 24-channel LAIRS machines. [oxy-Hb] increases in the bipolar disorder group were smaller than those in the healthy control group during the early period of a verbal fluency task, larger than those in the major depression and healthy control groups during the late period of this task, and were smaller than those in the major depression group during a finger-tapping task. Depressive symptoms and antidepressant dosages did not correlate with [oxy-Hb] changes in the two patient groups.

1006,1003,"This study examined the effects of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on cerebral responses to a verbal learning task with two levels of word difficulty. A total of 32 subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) after normal sleep and following 36 h of TSD. Cerebral responses to EASY words were identical on both nights, but several brain regions showed increased activation to HARD words following TSD compared with following a normal night of sleep (NORM). These regions included bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal lobe. Better free recall performance on the HARD words after TSD was related to increased cerebral responses within the left inferior and superior parietal lobes and left inferior frontal gyrus. Recall was negatively related to activation within the right inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, the findings support the predictions of the compensatory recruitment hypothesis that task demands influence both the likelihood and location of increased cerebral activation during task performance following TSD, and refine that hypothesis by identifying a specific task demand that plays a role. The performance relationships suggest increased activation may be both beneficial (compensatory) and interfere with task performance, depending on the brain regions involved.

A. 99, 15238-15243.) has suggested that semantic knowledge about the psychological aspects of other people draws on a pattern of neural activity that differentiates social from nonsocial semantics. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) clearly plays a central role in a range of such social-cognitive tasks, little is known about the precise contributions made by this region to social semantics. The current study addressed two outstanding questions regarding mPFC function. First, do mPFC contributions to processing words that refer to psychological states extend to other, nonhuman targets or are they specific to understanding the psychological experience of conspecifics? Second, does the mPFC respond generally to tasks that require processing another person, or is its activity specific to understanding psychological characteristics? To address these questions, participants were scanned using fMRI while judging the applicability of words to one of two types of targets: people or dogs. For each target, participants made one of two types of semantic judgment: does this word describe a potential psychological state of the target or does this word refer to a physical part of the target? Results demonstrated that greater mPFC activation accompanied judgments of psychological states than of body parts regardless of whether the target was a person or a dog, indicating that mPFC contributions to social semantics are specific for understanding psychological states-directly countering recent suggestions that mPFC responds generally to any judgment about another person-and that mPFC activity extends to targets other than conspecifics.

Severity of OCD symptoms showed a significant negative correlation with thalamic/hypothalamic SERT availability, corrected for age and duration of symptoms.

Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the NAc and the VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Responses in the NAc and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences.

No regions were found exhibiting correlations of IQ with MD except for one frontal area significantly overlapping a region containing a significant correlation with FA. The positive direction of the correlation with FA is the same as that found previously with age, and indicates a positive relationship between fiber organization and/or density with cognitive function.

Using a voxelwise analysis technique, the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were tested for significant correlations with Wechsler full-scale IQ scores, with subject age and gender used as covariates. Regions displaying significant positive correlations of IQ scores with FA were found bilaterally in white matter association areas, including frontal and occipito-parietal areas. No regions were found exhibiting correlations of IQ with MD except for one frontal area significantly overlapping a region containing a significant correlation with FA. The positive direction of the correlation with FA is the same as that found previously with age, and indicates a positive relationship between fiber organization and/or density with cognitive function. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that regionally specific increased fiber organization is a mechanism responsible for the normal development of white matter tracts.",Cognitive functions correlate with white matter architecture in a normal pediatric population: A diffusion tensor MRI study,2005,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,Article,15858815,"['DTI', 'MRI']",2.52,MRI
1014,1011,"In this study, we evaluate the performance of a flow-based surface evolution fiber tracking algorithm by means of a physical anisotropic diffusion phantom with known connectivity. We introduce a novel speed function for surface evolution that is derived from either diffusion tensor (DT) data, high angular resolution diffusion (HARD) data, or a combined DT-HARD hybrid approach. We use the model-free q-ball imaging (QBI) approach for HARD reconstruction. The anisotropic diffusion phantom allows us to compare and evaluate the performance of different fiber tracking approaches in the presence of real imaging artifacts, noise, and subvoxel partial volume averaging of fiber directions. The surface evolution approach, using the full diffusion tensor as opposed to the principal diffusion direction (PDD) only, is compared to PDD-based line propagation fiber tracking. Additionally, DT reconstruction is compared to HARD reconstruction for fiber tracking, both using surface evolution. We show the potential for surface evolution using the full diffusion tensor to map connections in regions of subvoxel partial volume averaging of fiber directions, which can be difficult to map with PDD-based methods. We then show that the fiber tracking results can be improved by using high angular resolution reconstruction of the diffusion orientation distribution function in cases where the diffusion tensor model fits the data poorly.

1015,1012,"The contribution of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to human cognition remains unclear. The rostral (rACC) and dorsal (dACC) ACC cortex are implicated in tasks that require increased response control due to emotional and cognitive interference, respectively. However, both rACC and dACC are activated by conditions that induce changes in visceral arousal, suggesting that ACC supports a generation of integrated bodily responses. To clarify the relationship between purely cognitive and psychophysiological accounts of ACC function, we scanned 15 subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed numerical versions of the Stroop task. To index autonomic arousal, we simultaneously measured pupil diameter. Performance errors accounted for most of the variance in a pupil-derived measure of evoked autonomic arousal. In analysis of the functional imaging data, activity within a region spanning rACC and dACC predicted trial-by-trial variation in autonomic response magnitude and was enhanced during error trials, shown using conjunction analyses. Activity within other loci within rACC predicted evoked autonomic arousal and showed sensitivity to errors but did not meet criteria for both. These data highlight the role of ACC in psychophysiological aspects of error processing and suggest that an interface exists within ACC between cognitive and biobehavioral systems in the service of response adaptation.

1016,1013,"We assessed the usefulness of the P300 wave as endophenotype for schizophrenia by means of a meta-analysis of the literature as well as our own family study. Method: Meta-analysis: We conducted a systematic search for articles published between 1983 and 2003 that reported P300 measures in nonpsychotic relatives of schizophrenic patients and in healthy controls. Meta-regression analyses were performed using a random effects procedure. The pooled standardized effect size (PSES) was calculated as the difference between the means of the two groups divided by the common standard deviation. Local study: We examined the P300 wave with a standard two-tone oddball paradigm in 30 patients with schizophrenia, 40 non-psychotic relatives, and 40 controls using linear mixed models. Results: Meta-analysis: We pooled 472 relatives and 513 controls. The P300 amplitude was significantly reduced in relatives (PSES = 0.61; 95% Cl: 0.30 to 0.91; P < 0.001). The P300 latency was significantly delayed in relatives (PSES of-0.50; 95% Cl: -0.88 to -0.13; P=0.009]. Local study: The patients showed a trend for amplitude reductions (P = 0.06) and significant latency delays (P < 0.01). The relatives displayed normal amplitude but had significant latency delays (P = 0.01). The P300 amplitude and especially the P300 latency are promising alternative phenotypes for genetic research into schizophrenia. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1017,1014,"This study assesses the performance of public-domain automated methodologies for MRI-based segmentation of the hippocampus in elderly subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Structural MR images of 54 age- and gender-matched healthy elderly individuals, subjects with probable AD, and subjects with MCI were collected at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Hippocampi in subject images were automatically segmented by using AIR, SPM, FLIRT, and the fully deformable method of Chen to align the images to the Harvard atlas, MNI atlas, and randomly selected, manually labeled subject images (""cohort atlases""). Mixed-effects statistical models analyzed the effects of side of the brain, disease state, registration method, choice of atlas, and manual tracing protocol on the spatial overlap between automated segmentations and expert manual segmentations. Registration methods that produced higher degrees of geometric deformation produced automated segmentations with higher agreement with manual segmentations. Side of the brain, presence of AD, choice of reference image, and manual tracing protocol were also significant factors contributing to automated segmentation performance. Fully automated techniques can be competitive with human raters on this difficult segmentation task, but a rigorous statistical analysis shows that a variety of methodological factors must be carefully considered to insure that automated methods perform well in practice. The use of fully deformable registration methods, cohort atlases, and user-defined manual tracings are recommended for highest performance in fully automated hippocampus segmentation.

1019,1016,"The ability to detect an error in one's own performance and then to improve ongoing performance based on this error processing is critical for effective behaviour. In our event-related fMRI experiment, we show that explicit awareness of a response inhibition commission error and subsequent post-error behaviour were associated with bilateral prefrontal and parietal brain activation. Activity in the anterior cingulate region, typically associated with error detection, was equivalent for both errors subjects were aware of and those they were not aware of making. While anterior cingulate activation has repeatedly been associated with error-related processing, these results suggest that, in isolation, it is not sufficient for conscious awareness of errors or post-error adaptation of response strategies. Instead, it appears, irrespective of awareness, to detect information about stimuli/responses that requires interpretation in other brain regions for strategic implementation of post-error adjustments of behaviour.

Treatment-specific as well as response-related changes in rCBF have been reported. We explored the changes in rCBF induced by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), a recently proposed antidepressant strategy, by application of single photon emission-computed tomography with Tc-99m-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime in otherwise treatment-refractory patients. Both region-of-interest (ROI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analytic approaches were used. Decreases of rCBF in the amygdala, left hippocampus, left subgenual cingulate cortex, left and right ventral anterior cingulum, right thalamus and brain stem were observed; the only increase of rCBF was found by SPM analysis in the middle frontal gyrus. This pattern shares features with changes of rCBF previously associated with the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Similarities to other brain-stimulation strategies in antidepressant treatment were less pronounced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1021,1018,"Studies have suggested that teens with alcohol use disorder (AUD) can demonstrate memory deficits, but the underlying neuroanatomical substrates are unclear. The hippocampus is crucial to intact memory functioning, and it actively develops during adolescence. The current study attempted to replicate and extend previous findings suggesting that adolescents with AUD show smaller hippocampal volumes than healthy adolescents. Manual tracings of bilateral hippocampi were performed on structural magnetic resonance images of 14 adolescents (ages 15 to 17 years) with AUD and 17 healthy comparison teens. Intracranial, white, and gray matter volumes, as well as memory abilities, were also measured. Results revealed that adolescents with AUD had significantly smaller left hippocampal volumes than healthy teens, even after removal of teens with comorbid conduct disorder from the analyses. In contrast, the groups did not differ in right hippocampal, intracranial, gray or white matter volumes, or memory performance. Hippocampal volumes were not related to alcohol-consumption rates. These findings indicate that adolescents with AUD, but free from other psychiatric comorbidities, have reduced left hippocampal volume. Because hippocampal volume did not relate to alcohol use characteristics, it is possible that premorbid volumetric differences could account for some of the observed group differences in hippocampal volume.

1022,1019,"The spatial extent of the changes in oxy-hemoglobin (HbO), deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), total hemoglobin concentration (HbT), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in response to forepaw and whisker stimulation were compared in the rat somatosensory cortex using a combination of multi-wavelength reflectance imaging and laser speckle contrast imaging of cerebral blood flow. The spatial extents of the response of each hemodynamic parameter and CMRO2 were found to be comparable at the time of peak response, and at early times following stimulation onset, the spatial extent of the change in HbR was smaller than that of HbO, HbT, CBF, and CMR02- In addition, a slight spatial dependence was found in the power law coefficient relating changes in CBF and HbT. Although the CMRO2 response is a metabolic measure and thus expected to have a more localized response than the hemodynamic parameters, the results presented here suggest that this may not be the case in general, possibly due to the increased sensitivity of optical imaging techniques to superficial cortical layers where the lateral extent of the metabolic and neuronal activation is larger compared to that in layer IV. In addition, we found that the measured spatial extent of the CMRO2 changes was insensitive to assumptions made in the calculation of the CMRO2 changes such as baseline hemoglobin concentrations, vascular weighting constants, and wavelength dependence of tissue scattering. Multi-parameter full field imaging of the functional response provides a more complete picture of the hemodynamic response to functional activation including the spatial and temporal estimation of CMRO2 changes.

1023,1020,"The ability to inhibit inappropriate responses is central to cognitive control, but whether the same brain mechanisms mediate inhibition across different tasks is not known. We present evidence for a common set of frontal and parietal regions engaged in response inhibition across three tasks: a go/no-go task, a flanker task, and a stimulus -response compatibility task. Regions included bilateral anterior insula/frontal operculum and anterior prefrontal, right dorsolateral and premotor, and parietal cortices. Insula activity was positively correlated with interference costs in behavioral performance in each task. Principal components analysis showed a coherent pattern of individual differences in these regions that was also positively correlated with performance in all three tasks. However, correlations among tasks were low, for both brain activity and performance. We suggest that common interference detection and/or resolution mechanisms are engaged across tasks, and that inter-task correlations in behavioral performance are low because they conflate measurements of common mechanisms with measurements of individual biases unique to each task.

1024,1021,"We show that during visual working memory, the electroencephalographic (EEG) process producing 5-7 Hz frontal midline theta (fm theta) activity exhibits multiple spectral modes involving at least three frequency bands and a wide range of amplitudes. The process accounting for the fm theta increase during working memory was separated from 71-channel data by clustering on time/frequency transforms of components returned by independent component analysis (ICA). Dipole models of fm theta component scalp maps were consistent with their generation in or near dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. From trial to trial, theta power of fm theta components varied widely but correlated moderately with theta power in other frontal and left temporal processes. The weak mean increase in frontal midline theta power with increasing memory load, produced entirely by the fm theta components, largely reflected progressively stronger theta activity in a relatively small proportion of trials. During presentations of letter series to be memorized or ignored, fm theta components also exhibited 1215 Hz low-beta activity that was stronger during memorized than during ignored letter trials, independent of letter duration. The same components produced a brief 3-Hz burst 500 ms after onset of the probe letter following each letter sequence. A new decomposition method, log spectral ICA, applied to normalized log time/frequency transforms of fm theta component Memorize-letter trials, showed that their low-beta activity reflected harmonic energy in continuous, sharppeaked theta wave trains as well as independent low-beta bursts. Possibly, the observed fm theta process variability may index dynamic adjustments in medial frontal cortex to trial-specific behavioral context and task demands. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1025,1022,"Pain perception is a multidimensional phenomenon, derived from sensory, affective, cognitive-evaluative and homeostatic information. Neuroimaging studies of pain perception have investigated the role of primary somatosensory cortex (SI); however, they have typically failed to demonstrate the expected somatotopy. An alternative network for the sensory component of pain has been proposed, involving a temperature and pain-specific nucleus of the thalamus (VMpo) and its projections to dorsal posterior insula (dpIns). According to this hypothesis, projections to the insula should be arranged somatotopically. In order to test for the presence of somatotopy in the operculo-insular brain region, we delivered moderately painful thermal stimuli to the right face, hand and foot in 14 healthy subjects and recorded brain responses using high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. For each subject, the thermode temperature was adjusted to produce pain ratings of 5 to 6 out of 10, which corresponded to average temperatures for the face, hand and foot of 49.6, 48.5 and 48.5 degrees C, respectively. Examination of mixed effects group activation maps suggested a pain-related somatotopy in the contralateral posterior insula and putamen. Construction of frequency maps revealed that face activation within the posterior insula was anterior to both hand and foot, whilst foot activation was located medially in the circular sulcus. Single subject analysis demonstrated that only coordinates for dpIns activation were significantly dependent on stimulus location (Hotelling's Trace, P = 0.012). Coordinates for face (paired t test, P = 0.004) and hand (P < 0.001) activity were more lateral than those for foot, whilst face activation was anterior to the foot (P = 0.037). Based on single subject analyses, the average standard space (MNI) coordinates for face, hand and foot activity were (-40,-16,11), (-40,-19,14) and (-35,-21,11) respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1026,1023,"Several neuroimaging studies have reported 'hypofrontality' in depressed patients performing a cognitive challenge compared to control subjects. Hypofrontality in depression is likely associated with an impaired behavioral performance. It is unclear whether this impaired performance is the consequence or the cause of hypofrontality. Consequently, we proposed to compare the cerebral activity of depressed patients and healthy subjects while controlling for the level of performance. Ten individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression and 10 healthy controls were tested with a verbal version of the n-back task during fMRI scanning. The working memory load was manipulated across the experiment (1,2,3-back) to increase the cognitive demands. fMRI data were acquired on a 1.5-T GE scanner and analyzed using SPM99 software. We did not find any difference between groups in both performance and reaction times for each level of complexity of the n-back task. Depressed patients and control subjects showed bilateral activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Activation of these regions was modulated by the complexity of the task. Within this n-back neural network, depressed patients showed greater activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate compared to healthy subjects. This study provides evidence that depressed patients need greater activation within the same neural network to maintain a similar level of performance as controls during a working memory task. Our findings suggest that depression may impair the cognitive capacity of depressed patients by recruiting more brain resources than controls during cognitive control. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1027,1024,"In vivo study of white matter microstructural integrity through magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) permits examination of degradation of axonal circuitry that may underlie functional decline of frontally-based processes in normal adult aging. Determination of the pattern of age-related degradation of white matter microstructure requires quantitative comparison of the rostral-caudal and superior-inferior extents of the brain's white matter. To date, this has not been accomplished, probably because of significant artifacts from spatial distortion and poor signal resolution that precludes accurate analysis in prefrontal and inferior brain regions. Here, we report a profile analysis of the integrity of white matter microstructure across the supratentorium and in selected focal regions using DTI data collected at high-field strength (3 T), with isotropic voxel acquisition, and an analysis based on a concurrently-acquired field map to permit accurate quantification of artifact-prone, anterior and inferior brain regions. The groups comprised 10 younger and 10 older individuals; all were high functioning, highly educated, and in excellent health. The DTI profile analysis revealed a robust frontal distribution of low white matter anisotropy and high bulk mean diffusivity in healthy older compared with younger adults. In contrast to frontal fiber systems, posterior systems were largely preserved with age. A second analysis, based on focal samples of FA, confirmed that the age-related EA decline was restricted to frontal regions, leaving posterior and inferior brain regions relatively intact. The selective decline of anterior anisotropy with advancing age provides evidence for the potential of a microstructural white matter mechanism for the commonly observed decline in frontally-based functions.

PET imaging with [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been used to identify characteristic patterns of regional glucose metabolism in patient cohorts with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as variant forms of parkinsonism such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBGD). In this study, we assessed the utility of FDG PET in the differential diagnosis of individual patients with clinical parkinsonism. 135 parkinsonian patients were referred for FDG PET to determine whether their diagnosis could be made accurately based upon their scans. Imaging-based diagnosis was obtained by visual assessment of the individual scans and also by computer-assisted interpretation. The results were compared with 2-year follow-up clinical assessments made by independent movement disorders specialists who were blinded to the original PET findings. We found that blinded computer assessment agreed with clinical diagnosis in 92.4% of all subjects (97.7% early PD, 91.6% late PD, 96% MSA, 85% PSP, 90.1% CBGD, 86.5% healthy control subjects).

This study demonstrates that FDG PET performed at the time of initial referral for parkinsonism accurately predicted the clinical diagnosis of individual patients made at subsequent follow-up. Computer-assisted methodologies may be particularly helpful in situations where experienced readers of FDG PET images are not readily available. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1030,1027,"Persistent dose-related cognitive decrements have been reported in 28-day abstinent heavy marijuana (MJ) users. However, the neural substrates of these decrements in cognitive performance are not known. This study aimed to determine if 25-day abstinent MJ users show persistent dose-related alterations in performance and brain activity using PET (H2O)-O-15 during the Iowa Gambling Task-IGT (a decision-making task). Eleven heavy MJ users and 11 non-drug users participated. The MJ group resided in an inpatient research unit at the NIH/NIDA-IRP for 25 days prior to testing to ensure abstinence. A dose-related association was found between increased MJ use and lower IGT performance and alterations in brain activity. The MJ group showed greater activation in the left cerebellum and less activation in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than the Control group. When the MJ group was divided into Moderate (8-35 joints/week) and Heavy users (53-84 joints/week), the Heavy MJ group showed less activation in the left medial OFC and greater activation in the left cerebellum than the Moderate group. However, brain activity and task performance were similar between the Moderate MJ users and the Control group, suggesting a ""threshold effect"". These preliminary findings indicate that very heavy users of MJ have persistent decision-making deficits and alterations in brain activity. Specifically the Heavy MJ users may focus on only the immediate reinforcing aspects of a situation (i.e., getting high) while ignoring the negative consequences. Thus, faulty decision-making could make an individual more prone to addictive behavior and more resistant to treatment. Finally, it is unclear if these neurologic findings will become progressively worse with continued heavy MJ use or if they will resolve with abstinence from MJ use. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1032,1029,"Aging is associated with a decline in both cognitive and motor abilities that reflects deterioration of underlying brain circuitry. While age-related alterations have also been described in brain regions underlying emotional behavior (e.g., the amygdala), the functional consequence of such changes is less clear. To this end, we used blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore age-related changes in brain regions underlying emotion processing. Twelve young (age < 30 years) and 14 elderly subjects (age > 60 years) were studied with BOLD fMRI during a paradigm that involved perceptual processing of fearful and threatening stimuli. Consistent with previous reports, direct group comparisons revealed relatively increased BOLD fMRI responses in prefrontal cortical regions, including Broca's area, and relatively decreased responses in the amygdala and posterior fusiform gyri in elderly subjects. Importantly, additional analyses using an elderly-specific brain template for spatial normalization of the elderly BOLD fMRI data confirmed these divergent regional response patterns. While there was no difference between groups in accuracy on the task, elderly subjects were significantly slower (delayed reaction times) in performing the task. Our current data suggest that elderly subjects engage a more distributed neocortical network during the perceptual processing of emotional facial expressions. In light of recent converging data froth two other studies, our observed effects may reflect age-related compensatory responses and/or alternative strategies in processing emotions, as the elderly appear to engage cognitive/linguistic systems in the context of reduced sensory and/or limbic responses.

1033,1030,"Morphology of the corpus callosum (CC) at the mid-sagittal level has been a target of extensive studies. However, the lack of internal structures and its polymorphism make it a challenging task to quantitatively analyze shape differences among subjects. In this paper, diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI) and tract tracing technique were applied to incorporate cortical connectivity information to the morphological study. The CC was parcellated into six major subdivisions based on trajectories to different cortical areas. This subdivision was performed for eight normal subjects and one stroke patient. The parcellated CCs of the normal subjects were normalized for morphological analysis. When comparing the stroke patient to the normal population, we detected significant atrophy in the motor and sensory areas of the patient CC, in line with the clinical deficits. This approach provides a new tool to investigate callosal morphology and functional relationships. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1034,1031,"The present fMRI study aimed at identifying neural correlates of the syntax-semantics interface in language comprehension. This was achieved by examining what we refer to as ""argument hierarchy construction"", i.e., determining which participant in a sentence is the ""Actor"" and which is the ""Undergoer"" of the event expressed by the verb. In order to identify the neural bases of argument hierarchy processing, we manipulated three factors known to influence the complexity of argument hierarchy construction in German, namely argument order, verb class and morphological ambiguity. Increased argument hierarchization demands engendered enhanced activation in a network of inferior frontal, posterior superior temporal, premotor and parietal areas. Moreover, components of this network were differentially modulated by the individual factors. In particular, the left posterior superior temporal sulcus showed an enhanced sensitivity for morphological information and the syntactic realization of the verb-based argument hierarchy, while the activation of the left inferior frontal gyros (pars opercularis) corresponded to linearization demands and was independent of morphological information. We therefore argue that, for German, posterior superior temporal and inferior frontal regions engage in the extraction of actorhood fro m morphosyntactic structure and in the sequential realization of hierarchical interpretive dependencies, respectively.

1035,1032,"Previous studies have shown that under some conditions, noise fluctuations in an fMRI time-course are dominated by physiological modulations of the image intensity with secondary contributions from thermal image noise and that these two sources scale differently with signal intensity, susceptibility weighting (TE) and field strength. The SNR of the fMRI time-course was found to be near its asymptotic limit for moderate spatial resolution measurements at 3 T with only marginal gains expected from acquisition at higher field strengths. In this study, we investigate the amplitude of image intensity fluctuations in the fMRI time-course at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T as a function of image resolution, flip angle and TE. The time-course SNR was a similar function of the image SNR regardless of whether the image SNR was modulated by flip angle, image resolution, or field strength. For spatial resolutions typical of those currently used in fMRI (e.g., 3 x 3 x 3 mm(3)), increases in image SNR obtained from 7 T acquisition produced only modest increases in time-course SNR. At this spatial resolution, the ratio of physiological noise to thermal image noise was 0.61, 0.89, and 2.23 for 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T. At a resolution of 1 x 1 x 3 mm(3), however, the physiological to thermal noise ratio was 0.34, 0.57, and 0.91 for 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T for TE near T2*. Thus, by reducing the signal strength using higher image resolution, the ratio of physiologic to image noise could be reduced to a regime where increased sensitivity afforded by higher field strength still translated to improved SNR in the fMRI time-series.

1037,1034,"Meta-analysis is an important tool for interpreting results of functional neuroimaging studies and is highly influential in predicting and testing new outcomes. Although traditional label-based review can be used to search for agreement across multiple studies, a new function-location meta-analysis technique called activation likelihood estimation (ALE) offers great improvements over conventional methods. In ALE, reported foci are modeled as Gaussian functions and pooled to create a statistical whole-brain image. ALE meta-analysis and the label-based review were used to investigate the Stroop task in normal subjects, a paradigm known for its effect of producing conflict and response inhibition due to subjects' tendency to perform word reading as opposed to color naming. Both methods yielded similar activation patterns that were dominated by response in the anterior cingulate and the inferior frontal gyros. ALE showed greater involvement of the anterior cingulate as compared to that in the label-based technique; however, this was likely due to the increased spatial level of distinction allowed with the ALE method. With ALE, further analysis of the anterior cingulate revealed evidence for somatotopic mapping within the rostral and caudal cingulate zones, an issue that has been the source of some conflict in previous reviews of the anterior cingulate cortex.

1038,1035,"A quantitative meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method was used to investigate the brain basis of the Wisconsin Card-Sorting Task (WCST) and two hypothesized component processes, task switching and response suppression. All three meta-analyses revealed distributed frontoparietal activation patterns consistent with the status of the WCST as an attention-demanding executive task. The WCST was associated with extensive bilateral clusters of reliable cross-study activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Task switching revealed a similar, although less robust, frontoparietal pattern with additional clusters of activity in the opercular region of the ventral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally. Response-suppression tasks, represented by studies of the go/no-go paradigm, showed a large and highly right-lateralized region of activity in the right prefrontal cortex. The activation patterns are interpreted as reflecting a neural fractionation of the cognitive components that must be integrated during the performance of the WCST.

1039,1036,"Human vision is an active process that involves shifting attention across the visual scene, with or without moving the eyes. Such shifts of attention can be generated at will (endogenously) or be triggered automatically, i.e., generated in response to exogenous stimuli including socially relevant cues such as someone else's gaze. What are the common and distinct brain mechanisms involved in these processes? To address this question, we carried out a quantitative effect-location meta-analysis of 59 brain-imaging experiments whose results were published using standardized coordinates. For each condition of interest, namely voluntary and visually triggered eye movements, voluntary and visually triggered (covert) shifts of attention, and perception of someone else's gaze, we computed activation likelihood estimation (ALE) maps. Those maps represent at each voxel of the brain the probability of reporting a signal change related to the condition of interest. For eye movements, this analysis confirmed the spatial location of the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, and parietal saccade-related regions. The map of covert shifts of attention demonstrated highest similarity with the map of saccadic eve movements. Gaze perception showed common activation likelihood with the other conditions in the right intraparietal sulcus and in the lateral precentral gyrus. It demonstrated more similarity with the reflexive than with the voluntary saccades and shifts of attention. We propose that a core network of frontoparietal and temporal brain regions is recruited when we shift the focus of our attention with or without eye movements in response to the appearance of a visual target, as well as when we see someone else shift his or her gaze.

1040,1037,"Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) has greatly advanced voxel-based meta-analysis research in the field of functional neuroimaging. We present two improvements to the ALE method. First, we evaluate the feasibility of two techniques for correcting for multiple comparisons: the single threshold test and a procedure that controls the false discovery rate (FDR). To test these techniques, foci from four different topics within the literature were analyzed: overt speech in stuttering subjects, the Color-word Stroop task, picture-naming tasks, and painful stimulation. In addition, the performance of each thresholding method was tested on randomly generated foci. We found that the FDR method more effectively controls the rate of false positives in meta-analyses of small or large numbers of foci. Second, we propose a technique for making statistical comparisons of ALE meta-analyses and investigate its efficacy on different groups of foci divided by task or response type and random groups of similarly obtained foci. We then give an example of how comparisons of this sort may lead to advanced designs in future meta-analytic research.

We first analyze the location bias for several representative adaptive and non-adaptive spatial filters using their resolution kernels. This analysis theoretically validates previously reported empirical findings that standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) has no location bias. We also find that the minimum-variance spatial filter does exhibit bias in the reconstructed location of a single source, but that this bias is eliminated by using the normalized lead field. We then focus on the comparison of sLORETA and the lead-field normalized minimum-variance spatial filter, and analyze the effect of noise on source location bias. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the measurements determines whether the sLORETA reconstruction has source location bias, while the lead-field normalized minimum-variance spatial filter has no location bias even in the presence of noise. Finally, we compare the spatial resolution for sLORETA and the minimum-variance filter, and show that the minimum-variance filter attains much higher resolution than sLORETA does.

1042,1039,"The present study investigates the functional neuroanatomy of music perception with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Three different subject groups were investigated to examine developmental aspects and effects of musical training: 10-year-old children with varying degrees of musical training, adults without formal musical training (nonmusicians), and adult musicians. Subjects made judgements on sequences that ended on chords that were music-syntactically either regular or irregular. In adults, irregular chords activated the inferior frontal gyrus, orbital frontolateral cortex, the anterior insula, ventrolateral premotor cortex, anterior and posterior areas of the superior temporal gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus, and the supramarginal gyrus. These structures presumably form different networks mediating cognitive aspects of music processing (such as processing of musical syntax and musical meaning, as well as auditory working memory), and possibly emotional aspects of music processing. In the right hemisphere, the activation pattern of children was similar to that of adults. In the left hemisphere, adults showed larger activations than children in prefrontal areas, in the supramarginal gyrus, and in temporal areas. In both adults and children, musical training was correlated with stronger activations in the frontal operculum and the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1043,1040,"We present a novel data smoothing and analysis framework for cortical thickness data defined on the brain cortical manifold. Gaussian kernel smoothing, which weights neighboring observations according to their 3D Euclidean distance, has been widely used in 3D brain images to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. When the observations fie on a convoluted brain surface, however-, it is more natural to assign the weights based on the geodesic distance along the surface. We therefore develop a framework for geodesic distance-based kernel smoothing and statistical analysis on the cortical manifolds. As an illustration, we apply our methods in detecting the regions of abnormal cortical thickness in 16 high functioning autistic children via random field based multiple comparison correction that utilizes the new smoothing technique.

1044,1041,"Reading is a complex cognitive skill that requires the coordination of multiple brain regions. Although functional neuroimaging studies highlight the cortical brain regions associated with a specific cognitive task like reading, they do not directly address the underlying neural connections necessary for efficient performance of this task. Adults with reading disability have demonstrated lower regional white matter connectivity, but it is not known whether this relationship between neuronal wiring and reading performance also holds in younger readers. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) that highlights the structural integrity of the brain wiring, we show that regional brain connectivity in the left temporo-parietal white matter correlates with a wide range of reading ability in children as young as 8-12 years old. Diffusion tensor tractography suggests that the posterior limb of the internal capsule is consistent with the location of the largest cluster of correlation between reading ability (Word Identification subtest) and fractional anisotropy.

1045,1042,"Adolescents' propensity for risk-taking and reward-seeking behaviors suggests a heightened sensitivity for reward, reflected by greater feedback-related activity, changes in reward circuitry (e.g., nucleus accumbens), ane/or a lower sensitivity to potential harm reflected by weaker feedback-related activity changes in avoidance circuitry (e.g., amygdala) relative to adults. Responses of nucleus accumbens and amygdala to valenced outcomes (reward receipt and reward omission) were assayed using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure paired with a monetary reward task in 14 adults and 16 adolescents. Bilateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens showed significantly greater activation when winning than when failing to win in both groups. Group comparisons revealed stronger activation of left nucleus accumbens by adolescents, and of left amygdala by adults. When examining responses to reward receipts and to reward omissions separately. the most robust group difference was within the amygdala during reward omission. The reduction of the fMRI BOLD signal in the amygdala in response to reward omission was larger for adults than for adolescents. Correlations showed a close link between negative emotion and amygdala decreased BOLD signal in adults, anti between positive emotion and nucleus accumbens activation in adolescents. Overall, these findings support the notion that the signal differences between positive and negative outcomes involve the nucleus accumbens more in adolescents than in adults, and the amygdala more in adults than in adolescents. These developmental differences, if replicated, may have important: implications for the development of early-onset disorders of emotion and motivation.

1046,1043,"Structural deformity of the hippocampus is characteristic of individuals with very mild and mild forms of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The purpose of this study was to determine whether a similar deformity of the hippocampus can predict the onset of dementia in nondemented elders. Using high dimensional diffeomorphic transformations of a neuroanatomical template, hippocampal volumes and surfaces were defined in 49 nondemented elders; the hippocampal surface was subsequently partitioned into three zones (i.e., lateral, superior and inferior-medial), which were proximal to the underlying CA1 subfield, CA2-4 subfields plus dentate gyrus, and subiculum, respectively. Annual clinical assessments using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), where CDR 0 indicates no dementia and CDR 0.5 indicates very mild dementia, were then performed for a mean of 4.9 years (range 0.9-7.1 years) to monitor subjects who converted from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Inward variation of the lateral zone and left hippocampal volume significantly predicted conversion to CDR 0.5 in separate Cox proportional hazards models. When hippocampal surface variation and volume were included in a single model, inward variation of the lateral zone of the left hippocampal surface was selected as the only significant predictor of conversion. The pattern of hippocampal surface deformation observed in nondemented subjects who later converted to CDR 0.5 was similar to the pattern of hippocampal surface deformation previously observed to discriminate subjects with very mild DAT and nondemented subjects. These results suggest that inward deformation of the left hippocampal surface in a zone corresponding to the CA1 subfield is an early predictor of the onset of DAT in nondemented elderly subjects.

1047,1044,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the effects of inspired hypoxic, hyperoxic, and hypercapnic gases on baseline and stimulus-evoked changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in spontaneously breathing rats under isoflurane anesthesia. Each animal was subjected to a baseline period of six inspired gas conditions (9% O-2, 12% O-2, 21% O-2, 100% O-2, 5% CO2, and 10% CO2) followed by a superimposed period of forepaw stimulation. Significant stimulus-evoked fMRI responses were found in the primary somatosensory cortices. Relative fMRI responses to forepaw stimulation varied across gas conditions and were dependent on baseline physiology, whereas absolute fMRI responses were similar across moderate gas conditions (12% 02, 21% 02 100% 02, and 5% CO2) and were relatively independent of baseline physiology. Consistent with data obtained using well-established techniques, baseline and stimulus-evoked CMRO2 were invariant across moderate physiological perturbations thereby supporting a CMRO2-fMRI technique for non-invasive CMRO2 measurement. However, under 9% O-2 and 10% CO2, Stimulus-evoked CBF and BOLD were substantially reduced and the CMRO2 formalism appeared invalid, likely due to attenuated neurovascular coupling and/or a failure of the model under extreme physiological perturbations. These findings demonstrate that absolute fMRI measurements help distinguish neural from non-neural contributions to the fMRI signals and may lend a more accurate measure of brain activity during states of altered basal physiology. Moreover, since numerous pharmacologic agents, pathophysiological states, and psychiatric conditions alter baseline physiology independent of neural activity, these results have implications for neuroimaging studies using relative fMRI changes to map brain activity.

1048,1045,"Recent hemodynamic imaging studies have shown that processing of low probability task-relevant target stimuli (i.e., oddballs) and low probability task-irrelevant novel stimuli elicit widespread activity in diverse, spatially distributed cortical and subcortical systems. The nature of this distributed response supports the model that processing of salient and novel stimuli engages many brain regions regardless of whether said regions were necessary for task performance. However, these latter neuroimaging studies largely employed small sample sizes and fixed-effect analyses, limiting the characterization and inference of the results. The present study addressed these issues by collecting a large sample size (n = 100) and employed random effects statistical models. Analyses were also conducted to determine the inter-subject reliability of the hemodynamic response and the effects of gender and age on target detection and novelty processing. Group data demonstrated highly significant activation in all 34 specified regions of interest for target detection and all 24 specified regions of interest for processing of novel stimuli. Neither age nor gender systematically influenced the results. These data are discussed within the context of a model that proposes that the mammalian brain has evolved to adopt a strategy of engaging distributed neuronal systems when processing salient stimuli despite the low probability that many of these brain regions are required for successful task performance. This process may be termed 'adaptive reflexive processing.' The implications of these results for interpreting functional MRI studies are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Whether a specialized neural mechanism for self-face recognition in humans exists remains unclear. We used event-related fMRI to investigate bra in regions selectively activated by images of one's own face. Ten right-handed normal subjects viewed digital morphs between their own face and a gender-matched familiar other presented in a random sequence. Subjects were instructed to press a button with the right hand if the image looked like their own face, and another button if it looked like a familiar or scrambled face. Contrasting the trials in which images contain more ""self"" with those containing more familiar ""other"" revealed signal changes in the right hemisphere (RH) including the inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior occipital gyros. The opposite contrast revealed voxels with higher signal intensity for images of ""other"" than for ""self"" in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Additional contrasts against baseline revealed that activity in the ""self"" minus ""other"" contrasts represent signal increases compared to baseline (null events) in ""self"" trials, while activity in the ""other"" minus ""self"" contrasts represent deactivations relative to baseline during ""self"" trials. Thus, a unique network involving frontoparietal structures described as part of the ""mirror neuron systern"" in the RH underlies self-face recognition, while regions comprising the ""default/resting state"" network deactivate less for familiar others. We provide a model that reconciles these findings and previously published work to account for the modulations in these two networks previously implicated in social cognition. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1051,1048,"Context exerts a powerful effect on cognitive performance and is clearly important for language processing, where lexical, sentential, and narrative contexts should differentially engage neural systems that support lexical, compositional, and discourse level semantics. Equally important, but thus far unexplored, is the role of context within narrative, as cognitive demands evolve and brain activity changes dynamically as subjects process different narrative segments. In this study, we used fMRI to examine the impact of context, comparing responses to a single, linguistically matched set of texts when these were differentially presented as random word lists, unconnected sentences and coherent narratives. We found emergent, context-dependent patterns of brain activity in each condition. Perisylvian language areas were always active, consistent with their supporting core linguistic computations. Sentence processing was associated with expanded activation of the frontal operculum and temporal poles. The same stimuli presented as narrative evoked robust responses in extrasylvian areas within both hemispheres, including precuneus, medial prefrontal, and dorsal temporo-parieto-occipital cortices. The right hemisphere was increasingly active as contextual complexity increased, maximal at the narrative level. Furthermore, brain activity was dynamically modulated as subjects processed different narrative segments: left hemisphere activity was more prominent at the onset, and right hemisphere more prominent at the resolution of a story, at which point, it may support a coherent representation of the narrative as a whole. These results underscore the importance of studying language in an ecologically valid context, suggesting a neural model for the processing of discourse.

1053,1050,"While much is known about the functional architecture of the visual system, little is known about its large-scale dynamics during perception. This study describes this dynamics with a high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. We recorded depth EEG of epileptic patients performing a face detection task and found that the stimuli induced strong modulations in the gamma band (40 Hz to 200 Hz) in selective occipital, parietal and temporal sites, in particular the fusiform gyros, the lateral occipital gyros and the intra-parietal sulcus. Occipito-temporal sites were the first to be activated, closely followed by the parietal sites, while portions of the primary visual cortex seemed to deactivate temporarily. Some of those effects were found to be correlated across distant sites, suggesting that a coordinated balance between regional gamma activations and deactivations could be involved during visual perception.

1054,1051,"This study used positron emission tomography (PET) to identify the brain substrate of self-referential reflective activity and to investigate its relationship with brain areas that are active during the resting state. Thirteen healthy volunteers performed reflective tasks pertaining to three different matters (the self, another person, and social issues) while they were scanned. Rest scans were also acquired, in which subjects were asked to simply relax and not think in a systematic way. The mental activity experienced during each scan was assessed with rating scales. The results showed that, although self-referential thoughts were most frequent during the self-referential task, some self-referential reflective activity also occurred during rest. Compared to rest, performing the reflective tasks was associated with increased blood flow in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the left anterior middle temporal gyros, the temporal pole bilaterally, and the right cerebellum; there was a decrease of blood flow in right prefrontal regions,and in medial and right lateral parietal regions. In addition, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) (1) was more active during the self-referential reflective task than during the other two reflective tasks, (2) showed common activation during rest and the self-referential task, and (3) showed a correlation between cerebral metabolism and the amount of self-referential processing.

Although not as time-tested as manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture does have the advantage of setting stimulation frequency and intensity objectively and quantifiably. Manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture at 2 Hz and 100 Hz, and tactile control stimulation were carried out at acupoint ST-36. Overall, electroacupuncture (particularly at low frequency) produced more widespread fMRI signal increase than manual acupuncture did, and all acupuncture stimulations produced more widespread responses than did our placebo-like tactile control stimulation. Acupuncture produced hemodynamic signal increase in the anterior insula, and decrease in limbic and paralimbic structures including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and the cortices of the subgenual and retrosplenial cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, frontal, and temporal poles, results not seen for tactile control stimulation. Only electroacupuncture produced significant signal increase in the anterior middle cingulate cortex, whereas 2-Hz electroacupuncture produced signal increase in the pontine raphe area.

1057,1053,"We sought to determine the influence of tissue damage and the potential impact of cortical reorganization on the performance to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) in patients at the earliest stage of multiple sclerosis (MS). Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments using PASAT as paradigm were carried out in 18 patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS (CISSMS) compared to 18 controls. MTR histogram analyses showed structural abnormalities in patients involving the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) but also the gray matter (GM). Mean PASAT scores were significantly lower in the group of patients taken as a whole, and were correlated with the mean NAWM MTR value. No correlation was observed between PASAT scores and GM MTR. However, in the subgroup of patients with normal PASAT performance (n = 9), fMRI showed larger activations in bilateral Brodmann area 45 (BA45) and right BA44 compared to that in controls (n = 18). In these areas with potentially compensatory reorganization, the whole group of patients (n = 18) showed significantly greater activation than controls (n = 18). Activation in the right BA45 was inversely correlated with the mean NAWM MTR and the peak position of GM MTR histograms of patients. This study indicates that even at the earliest stage of MS, cortical reorganization is present inside the executive system of working memory and could tend to limit the determinant functional impact of NAWM injury on the execution of the PASAT.

1059,1055,"The ability to deceive others is a high-level social and cognitive function. It has been suggested that response conflict and cognitive control increase during deceptive acts but this hypothesis has not been evaluated directly. Using fMRI, we tested this prediction for the execution of an intentional false response. Subjects were instructed to respond truthfully or falsely to a series of yes/no questions that were also varied in autobiographical and nonautobiographical content to further examine the influence of personal relevance when lying. We observed an interference effect (longer reaction times for false versus true responses) that was accompanied by increased activation within the anterior cingulate, caudate and thalamic nuclei, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a circuit that has been implicated in response conflict and cognitive control. Behavioral and neural effects were more robust when falsifying autobiographical responses relative to nonautobiographical responses. Furthermore, a correlation between reaction time and left caudate activity supported the presence of increased response inhibition when falsifying responses. When presented with self-relevant (autobiographical) stimuli regardless of response condition, the mesial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices were recruited. Neural activity within these two regions and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also showed correlations with self-report personality measures from the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI). Overall, we conclude that the process of interference is inherent to the act of falsifying information and that the amount of conflict induced and cognitive control needed to successfully execute false responses is greater when dealing with personal information.

IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging, 23 (2) 137-152) to higher dimensions. This results in a three-way decomposition that represents the different signals and artefacts present in the data in terms of their temporal, spatial, and subject-dependent variations. The technique is derived from and compared with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC; Harshman and Lundy, 1984. In Research methods for multimode data analysis, chapter 5, pages 122-215. Praeger, New York). Using simulated data as well as data from multisession and multisubject FMRI studies we demonstrate that the tensor PICA approach is able to efficiently and accurately extract signals of interest in the spatial, temporal, and subject/session domain. The final decompositions improve upon PARAFAC results in terms of greater accuracy, reduced interference between the different estimated sources (reduced cross-talk), robustness (against deviations of the data from modeling assumptions and against overritting), and computational speed. On real FMRI 'activation' data, the tensor PICA approach is able to extract plausible activation maps, time courses, and session/subject modes as well as provide a rich description of additional processes of interest such as image artefacts or secondary activation patterns. The resulting data decomposition gives simple and useful representations of multisubject/multisession FMRI data that can aid the interpretation and optimization of group FMRI studies beyond what can be achieved using model-based analysis techniques.

Automated image processing was used to analyze high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images from 49 active heavy drinkers and 49 age- and sex-matched light drinkers, yielding gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes within the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Regional brain volume measures were compared as a function of group, sex and their interaction. Within heavy drinkers, volumes were correlated with measures of alcohol consumption and compared as a function of family history of problem drinking. Deformation morphometry explored localized patterns of atrophy associated with heavy drinking or severity of drinking. We found significant gray matter volume losses, but no white matter losses, in active heavy drinkers compared with light drinkers. Women had greater gray matter and smaller white matter and CSF volumes as a percentage of intracranial vault than men. Within heavy drinkers, smaller gray matter volumes were associated with higher current levels of drinking and older age, while a positive family history of problem drinking was associated with smaller CSF volumes. Community-dwelling heavy drinkers who are not in alcoholism treatment have dose-related gray matter volume losses, and family history of problem drinking ameliorates some structural consequences of heavy drinking.

It has been assumed that the former is underpinned by damage to the temporal lobes and the latter, predominantly, by damage to the frontal lobes. Using the technique of voxel-based morphometry, we studied a group of FTD cases (n = 18) with a range of cognitive and neuropsychiatric features to correlate loss of semantic knowledge (as measured by the sum of two semantic tests) and aberrant behaviour (as measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory, NPI) with regional loss of grey matter volume. Semantic breakdown correlated with extensive loss of grey matter volume throughout the left anterior temporal lobe and less significantly with right temporal pole and subcallosal gyrus. Aberrant behaviour correlated with loss of grey matter volume in the dorso-mesial frontal lobe-paracingulate region, Brodmann areas 6/8/9-more so on the right. The frontal paracingulate correlation suggests that damage to this region may significantly contribute to the genesis of the behavioural syndrome seen in FTD. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1065,1061,"During acoustic communication among human beings, emotional information can be expressed both by the propositional content of verbal utterances and by the modulation of speech melody (affective prosody). It is well established that linguistic processing is bound predominantly to the left hemisphere of the brain. By contrast, the encoding of emotional intonation has been assumed to depend specifically upon right-sided cerebral structures. However, prior clinical and functional imaging studies yielded discrepant data with respect to interhemispheric lateralization and intrahemispheric localization of brain regions contributing to processing of affective prosody. In order to delineate the cerebral network engaged in the perception of emotional tone, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed during recognition of prosodic expressions of five different basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, fearful, and disgusted) and during phonetic monitoring of the same stimuli. As compared to baseline at rest, both tasks yielded widespread bilateral hemodynamic responses within frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. A comparison of the respective activation maps, however, revealed comprehension of affective prosody to be bound to a distinct right-hemisphere pattern of activation, encompassing posterior superior temporal sulcus (Brodmann Area [BA] 22), dorsolateral (BA 44/45), and orbitobasal (BA 47) frontal areas. Activation within left-sided speech areas, in contrast, was observed during the phonetic task. These findings indicate that partially distinct cerebral networks subserve processing of phonetic and intonational information during speech perception. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Activation increases were observed in left BA 44, to-ether with superior temporal areas and right hemispheric homologues for sentences with noncanonical word order, in which a verb argument was dislocated from its canonical position over a relatively long distance. In these sentences, syntactic working memory load was assumed to be greatest. In contrast, no activation increase was elicited by object-initial as opposed to subject-initial sentences that did not differ with respect to working memory costs but with respect to syntactic integration costs.

1067,1063,"The James-Lange theory of emotion proposes that automatically generated bodily reactions not only color subjective emotional experience of stimuli, but also necessitate a mechanism by which these bodily reactions are differentially generated to reflect stimulus quality. To examine this putative mechanism, we simultaneously measured brain activity and heart rate to identify regions where neural activin predicted the magnitude of heart rate responses to emotional facial expressions. Using a forewarned reaction time task, we showed that orienting heart rate acceleration to emotional face stimuli was modulated as a function of the emotion depicted. The magnitude of evoked heart rate increase, both across the stimulus set and within each emotion category, was predicted by, level of activity within a matrix of interconnected brain regions. including amygdala. insula. anterior cingulate, and brainstem.

1070,1066,"Converging evidence suggests that hyperactivity in frontal-striatal circuits and in action-monitoring processes characterizes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It remains unclear, however, just how these abnormalities in brain function translate into the cognitive, affective, and behavioral manifestations of OCD. One possibility is that exaggerated or false error signals generated by the anterior cingulate (ACC) underlie compulsive behaviors by triggering the feeling that things are ""not just right"" even when no actual error has been made. Since recurrent compulsive behavior typically follows correct completion of a behavioral task (e.g., hand washing), ACC hyperactivity should be observed during correctly completed, high-conflict trials as well as during error trials. Frontal-striatal regions would also be expected to be activated during both trial types, as these regions are robustly associated with OCD across multiple neuroimaging paradigms. To test this hypothesis, 14 OCD patients and 14 matched controls completed a speeded reaction time task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Only correctly rejected, high-conflict trials produced excessive activation in both action monitoring (rostral and caudal ACC, LPFC) and frontal striatal regions (lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate, and thalamus) among OCD patients when compared to healthy controls. Portions of the posterior cingulate were also hyperactive among OCD patients. These results suggest that correctly rejected, high-conflict trials that require response inhibition may provide a better model than error trials of compulsive behaviors in OCD.

The current study aimed to identify the neural substrates of cognitive control during conflict adaptation by isolating neural correlates of reduced conflict from those of increased cognitive control. We expected cognitive control to be implemented by prefrontal cortex through context-specific modulation of posterior regions involved in sensory and motor aspects of task performance. We collected event-related fMRI data on a color-word naming Stroop task and found distinct fronto-parietal networks of current trial conflict detection and conflict adaptation through cognitive control. Conflict adaptation was associated with increased activity in left middle frontal gyrus (GFm) and superior frontal gyrus (GFs), consistent with increased cognitive control, and with decreased activity in bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, consistent with reduced response conflict. Psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) revealed that cognitive control activation in GFs and GFm was accompanied by increased functional integration with bilateral inferior frontal, right temporal and parietal areas, and the anterior cerebellum. These data suggest that cognitive control is implemented by medial and lateral prefrontal cortices that bias processes in regions that have been implicated in high-level perceptual and motor processes.

1073,1069,"Risk anticipation is an important cognitive/emotional component of decision making. The Iowa Gambling Task [Bechara, A., Damasio, A.R., Damasio, H., Anderson, S.W., 1994. Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition 50, 7-15], which is the most widely used ""risk-anticipation task"" in clinical studies, has been demonstrated to be sensitive to lesions involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or amygdala. However, the critical neural circuitry involved in this complex task has not yet been fully clarified even in healthy subjects. Using a 3-T scanner, we performed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 14 healthy subjects performing the task. The statistical parametric mapping showed that the risk anticipation component (risky decisions minus safe decisions) exclusively activated the medial frontal gyros. Furthermore, we found a significant interindividual correlation between the task performance and the magnitude of brain activity during risky decisions. These results indicate that the Iowa Gambling Task does recruit the neural circuitry that is critical in decision making under uncertainty, particularly when subjects perceive the risk of their decision.

1074,1070,"Suicide and depression are associated with reduced serotonergic neurotransmission. In suicides, there is a reduction in serotonin transporter (SERT) sites and an increase in postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in localized regions of the prefrontal cortex. In depression, there is a diffuse decrease in SERT binding throughout the dorsoventral extent of the prefrontal cortex. Serotonergic innervation of the prefrontal cortex arises predominantly from neurons in the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We, therefore, examined postmortem SERT binding and mRNA expression, as well as 5-HT1A autoreceptor binding in the DRN of 10 matched pairs of controls and depressed suicide victims. The concentration of SERT sites, SERT mRNA, and 5-HT1A binding was not different between controls and suicides (p > .05). In the DRN of suicides, the volume of tissue defined by 5-HT1A binding was 40% smaller than controls. An index of the total number of 5-HT1A receptors (receptor binding x volume of receptor distribution) was 43.3% lower in the DRN of suicides, compared with controls. The suicide group had 54% fewer DRN neurons expressing SERT mRNA compared with controls. In the serotonin neurons that expressed the SERT gene, expression per neuron was greater in suicides. Less total 5-HT1A and SERT binding is consistent with results Of in vivo studies in depression. Less feedback inhibition of serotonin DRN firing via 5-HT1A autoreceptors and enhancement of serotonin action due to less uptake of serotonin, is consistent with compensatory changes in response to hypofunction in depressed suicides.
