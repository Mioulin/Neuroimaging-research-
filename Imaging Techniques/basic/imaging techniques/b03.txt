AB Distributed source models of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data employ dense distributions of current sources in a volume or on a surface. Previously, anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been used to constrain locations and orientations based on cortical geometry extracted from anatomical MRI data. We extended this approach by first calculating cortical patch statistics (CPS), which for each patch corresponding to a current source location on the cortex comprise the area of the patch, the average normal direction, and the average deviation of the surface normal from its average. The patch areas were then incorporated in the forward model to yield estimates of the surface current density instead of dipole amplitudes at the current locations. The surface normal data were employed in a loose orientation constraint (LOC), which allows some variation of the current direction from the average normal. We employed this approach both in the l(2) minimum-norm estimates (MNE) and in the more focal l(1) minimum-norm solutions, the minimum-current estimate (MCE). Simulations in auditory and somatosensory areas with current dipoles and 10- or 20-mm diameter cortical patches as test sources showed that applying the LOC can increase localization accuracy. We also applied the method to in vivo auditory and somatosensory data.

AB Subjects were scanned in a single functional MRI (fMRI) experiment that enabled us to localize cortical regions in each subject in the occipital and temporal lobes that responded significantly in a variety of contrasts: faces > objects, body parts > objects, scenes > objects, objects > scrambled objects, and Moving > stationary stimuli. The resulting activation maps were coregistered across subjects using spherical surface coordinates [Fischl et al., Hum Brain Mapp 1999;8:272-284] to produce a "percentage overlap map" indicating the percentage of subjects who showed a significant response for each contrast at each point on the surface. Prominent among the overlapping activations in these contrasts were the fusiform face area (FFA), extrastriate body area (EBA), parahippocampal place area (PPA), lateral occipital complex (LOC), and MT+/V5; only a few other areas responded consistently across subjects in these contrasts. Another analysis showed that the spatial profile of the selective response drops off quite sharply outside the standard borders of the FFA and PPA (less so for the EBA and MT+/V5), indicating that these regions are not simply peaks of very broad selectivities spanning centimeters of cortex, but fairly discrete regions of cortex with distinctive functional profiles. The data also yielded a surprise that challenges our understanding of the function of area MT+: a higher response to body parts than to objects. The anatomical consistency of each of our functionally defined regions across subjects and the spatial sharpness of their activation profiles within subjects highlight the fact that these regions constitute replicable and distinctive landmarks in the functional organization of the human brain.

AB Little is known about the effects of successful psychotherapy on brain function in subjects with anxiety disorders. The present study aimed to identify changes in brain activation following cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in subjects suffering from specific phobia. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain activation to spider videos was measured in 28 spider phobic and 14 healthy control subjects. Phobics were randomly assigned to a therapy-group (TG) and a waiting-list control group (WG). Both groups of phobics were scanned twice. Between scanning sessions, CBT was given to the TG. Before therapy, brain activation did not differ between both groups of phobics. As compared to control subjects, phobics showed greater responses to spider vs. control videos in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). CBT strongly reduced phobic symptoms in the TG while the WG remained behaviorally unchanged. In the second scanning session, a significant reduction of hyperactivity in the insula and ACC was found in the TG compared to the WG. These results propose that increased activation in the insula and ACC is associated with specific phobia, whereas an attenuation of these brain responses correlates with successful therapeutic intervention.

AB Frontal lobe dysfunction has been implicated as one of the pathophysiological bases of bipolar disorder. Detailed time courses of brain activation in the bipolar disorder group were investigated using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (LAIRS), a recently developed functional neuroimaging technology with a high time resolution, and were compared with those in the major depression and healthy control groups. Seventeen patients with bipolar disorder, 11 equally depressed patients with major depression, and 17 healthy controls participated in the study. Changes in oxy hemoglobin concentration ([oxy-Hb]) during cognitive and motor tasks were monitored using frontal and temporal probes of two sets of 24-channel LAIRS machines. [oxy-Hb] increases in the bipolar disorder group were smaller than those in the healthy control group during the early period of a verbal fluency task, larger than those in the major depression and healthy control groups during the late period of this task, and were smaller than those in the major depression group during a finger-tapping task. Depressive symptoms and antidepressant dosages did not correlate with [oxy-Hb] changes in the two patient groups. Bipolar disorder and major depression were characterized by preserved but delayed and reduced frontal lobe activations, respectively, in the present high-time-resolution study by multichannel LAIRS.

AB This study examined the effects of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on cerebral responses to a verbal learning task with two levels of word difficulty. A total of 32 subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) after normal sleep and following 36 h of TSD. Cerebral responses to EASY words were identical on both nights, but several brain regions showed increased activation to HARD words following TSD compared with following a normal night of sleep (NORM). These regions included bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal lobe. Better free recall performance on the HARD words after TSD was related to increased cerebral responses within the left inferior and superior parietal lobes and left inferior frontal gyrus. Recall was negatively related to activation within the right inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, the findings support the predictions of the compensatory recruitment hypothesis that task demands influence both the likelihood and location of increased cerebral activation during task performance following TSD, and refine that hypothesis by identifying a specific task demand that plays a role. The performance relationships suggest increased activation may be both beneficial (compensatory) and interfere with task performance, depending on the brain regions involved.

AB Deception is a clinically important behavior with poorly understood neurobiological correlates. Published functional MRI (fMRI) data on the brain activity during deception indicates that, on a multisubject group level, lie is distinguished from truth by increased prefrontal and parietal activity. These findings are theoretically important; however, their applied value will be determined by the accuracy of the discrimination between single deceptive and truthful responses in individual subjects. This study presents the first quantitative estimate of the accuracy of fMRI in conjunction with a formal forced-choice paradigm in detecting deception in individual subjects. We used a paradigm balancing the salience of the target cues to elicit deceptive and truthful responses and determined the accuracy of this model in the classification of single lie and truth events. The relative salience of the task cues affected the net activation associated with lie in the superior medial and inferolateral prefrontal cortices. Lie was discriminated from truth on a single-event level with an accuracy of 78%, while the predictive ability expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was 85%. Our findings confirm that fMRI, in conjunction with a carefully controlled query procedure, could be used to detect deception in individual subjects. Salience of the task cues is a potential confounding factor in the fMRI pattern attributed to deception in forced choice deception paradigms.

AB Recent neuroimaging research (Mitchell, J.P., Heatherton, T.F., Macrae, C.N., 2002. Distinct neural systems subserve person and object knowledge. Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 15238-15243.) has suggested that semantic knowledge about the psychological aspects of other people draws on a pattern of neural activity that differentiates social from nonsocial semantics. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) clearly plays a central role in a range of such social-cognitive tasks, little is known about the precise contributions made by this region to social semantics. The current study addressed two outstanding questions regarding mPFC function. First, do mPFC contributions to processing words that refer to psychological states extend to other, nonhuman targets or are they specific to understanding the psychological experience of conspecifics? Second, does the mPFC respond generally to tasks that require processing another person, or is its activity specific to understanding psychological characteristics? To address these questions, participants were scanned using fMRI while judging the applicability of words to one of two types of targets: people or dogs. For each target, participants made one of two types of semantic judgment: does this word describe a potential psychological state of the target or does this word refer to a physical part of the target? Results demonstrated that greater mPFC activation accompanied judgments of psychological states than of body parts regardless of whether the target was a person or a dog, indicating that mPFC contributions to social semantics are specific for understanding psychological states-directly countering recent suggestions that mPFC responds generally to any judgment about another person-and that mPFC activity extends to targets other than conspecifics.

AB In the present study, we applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to perform multivariate classification of brain states from whole functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) volumes without prior selection of spatial features. In addition, we did a comparative analysis between the SVM and the Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) classifier. We applied the methods to two multisubject attention experiments: a face matching and a location matching task. We demonstrate that SVM outperforms FLD in classification performance as well as in robustness of the spatial maps obtained (i.e. discriminating volumes). In addition, the SVM discrimination maps had greater overlap with the general linear model (GLM) analysis compared to the FLD. The analysis presents two phases: during the training, the classifier algorithm finds the set of regions by which the two brain states can be best distinguished from each other. In the next phase, the test phase, given an fMRI volume from a new subject, the classifier predicts the subject's instantaneous brain state. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) has received much recent attention, since it potentially offers a new tool for neuroscientists that makes simultaneous use of the strengths of the two modalities. However, EEG data collected in such experiments suffer from two kinds of artifact. First, gradient artifacts are caused by the switching of magnetic gradients during fMRI Second, ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifacts related to cardiac activities further contaminate the EEG data. Here we present new methods to remove both kinds of artifact. The methods are based primarily on the idea that temporal variations in the artifacts can be captured by performing temporal principal component analysis (PCA), which leads to the identification of a set of basis functions which describe the temporal variations in the artifacts. These basis functions are then fitted to, and subtracted from, EEG data to produce artifact-free results. In addition, we also describe a robust algorithm for the accurate detection of heart beat peaks from poor quality electrocardiographic (ECG) data that are collected for the purpose of BCG artifact removal. The methods are tested and are shown to give superior results to existing methods. The methods also demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneous EEG/FMRI experiments using the relatively low EEG sampling frequency of 2048 Hz. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the success of pharmacological treatment with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic drugs suggests that both the central serotonergic and dopaminergic systems are involved in the pathophysiology of the disorder. We applied [I-123]-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-idiophenyl)tropane (beta-CIT) and a brain-dedicated high-resolution single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system to quantify dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) availability. By comparing 15 drug-naive patients with OCD and 10 controls, we found a significantly reduced availability (corrected for age) of striatal DAT and of thalamic/hypothalamic, midbrain and brainstem SERT in OCD patients. Severity of OCD symptoms showed a significant negative correlation with thalamic/hypothalamic SERT availability, corrected for age and duration of symptoms. Our data provide evidence for imbalanced monoaminergic neurotransmitter modulation in OCD. Further studies with more selective DAT and SERT radiotracers are needed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Although the neural underpinnings of music cognition have been widely studied in the last 5 years, relatively little is known about the neuroscience underlying emotional reactions that music induces in listeners. Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the NAc and the VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Responses in the NAc and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences.

AB A possible relationship between cognitive abilities and white matter structure as assessed by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was investigated in the pediatric population. DTI was performed on 47 normal children ages 5-18. Using a voxelwise analysis technique, the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were tested for significant correlations with Wechsler full-scale IQ scores, with subject age and gender used as covariates. Regions displaying significant positive correlations of IQ scores with FA were found bilaterally in white matter association areas, including frontal and occipito-parietal areas. No regions were found exhibiting correlations of IQ with MD except for one frontal area significantly overlapping a region containing a significant correlation with FA. The positive direction of the correlation with FA is the same as that found previously with age, and indicates a positive relationship between fiber organization and/or density with cognitive function. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that regionally specific increased fiber organization is a mechanism responsible for the normal development of white matter tracts.

AB In this study, we evaluate the performance of a flow-based surface evolution fiber tracking algorithm by means of a physical anisotropic diffusion phantom with known connectivity. We introduce a novel speed function for surface evolution that is derived from either diffusion tensor (DT) data, high angular resolution diffusion (HARD) data, or a combined DT-HARD hybrid approach. We use the model-free q-ball imaging (QBI) approach for HARD reconstruction. The anisotropic diffusion phantom allows us to compare and evaluate the performance of different fiber tracking approaches in the presence of real imaging artifacts, noise, and subvoxel partial volume averaging of fiber directions. The surface evolution approach, using the full diffusion tensor as opposed to the principal diffusion direction (PDD) only, is compared to PDD-based line propagation fiber tracking. Additionally, DT reconstruction is compared to HARD reconstruction for fiber tracking, both using surface evolution. We show the potential for surface evolution using the full diffusion tensor to map connections in regions of subvoxel partial volume averaging of fiber directions, which can be difficult to map with PDD-based methods. We then show that the fiber tracking results can be improved by using high angular resolution reconstruction of the diffusion orientation distribution function in cases where the diffusion tensor model fits the data poorly.

AB The contribution of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to human cognition remains unclear. The rostral (rACC) and dorsal (dACC) ACC cortex are implicated in tasks that require increased response control due to emotional and cognitive interference, respectively. However, both rACC and dACC are activated by conditions that induce changes in visceral arousal, suggesting that ACC supports a generation of integrated bodily responses. To clarify the relationship between purely cognitive and psychophysiological accounts of ACC function, we scanned 15 subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed numerical versions of the Stroop task. To index autonomic arousal, we simultaneously measured pupil diameter. Performance errors accounted for most of the variance in a pupil-derived measure of evoked autonomic arousal. In analysis of the functional imaging data, activity within a region spanning rACC and dACC predicted trial-by-trial variation in autonomic response magnitude and was enhanced during error trials, shown using conjunction analyses. Activity within other loci within rACC predicted evoked autonomic arousal and showed sensitivity to errors but did not meet criteria for both. These data highlight the role of ACC in psychophysiological aspects of error processing and suggest that an interface exists within ACC between cognitive and biobehavioral systems in the service of response adaptation.

AB We assessed the usefulness of the P300 wave as endophenotype for schizophrenia by means of a meta-analysis of the literature as well as our own family study.
   Method: Meta-analysis: We conducted a systematic search for articles published between 1983 and 2003 that reported P300 measures in nonpsychotic relatives of schizophrenic patients and in healthy controls. Meta-regression analyses were performed using a random effects procedure. The pooled standardized effect size (PSES) was calculated as the difference between the means of the two groups divided by the common standard deviation. Local study: We examined the P300 wave with a standard two-tone oddball paradigm in 30 patients with schizophrenia, 40 non-psychotic relatives, and 40 controls using linear mixed models.
   Results: Meta-analysis: We pooled 472 relatives and 513 controls. The P300 amplitude was significantly reduced in relatives (PSES = 0.61; 95% Cl: 0.30 to 0.91; P < 0.001). The P300 latency was significantly delayed in relatives (PSES of-0.50; 95% Cl: -0.88 to -0.13; P=0.009]. Local study: The patients showed a trend for amplitude reductions (P = 0.06) and significant latency delays (P < 0.01). The relatives displayed normal amplitude but had significant latency delays (P = 0.01). The P300 amplitude and especially the P300 latency are promising alternative phenotypes for genetic research into schizophrenia. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study assesses the performance of public-domain automated methodologies for MRI-based segmentation of the hippocampus in elderly subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Structural MR images of 54 age- and gender-matched healthy elderly individuals, subjects with probable AD, and subjects with MCI were collected at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Hippocampi in subject images were automatically segmented by using AIR, SPM, FLIRT, and the fully deformable method of Chen to align the images to the Harvard atlas, MNI atlas, and randomly selected, manually labeled subject images ("cohort atlases"). Mixed-effects statistical models analyzed the effects of side of the brain, disease state, registration method, choice of atlas, and manual tracing protocol on the spatial overlap between automated segmentations and expert manual segmentations. Registration methods that produced higher degrees of geometric deformation produced automated segmentations with higher agreement with manual segmentations. Side of the brain, presence of AD, choice of reference image, and manual tracing protocol were also significant factors contributing to automated segmentation performance. Fully automated techniques can be competitive with human raters on this difficult segmentation task, but a rigorous statistical analysis shows that a variety of methodological factors must be carefully considered to insure that automated methods perform well in practice. The use of fully deformable registration methods, cohort atlases, and user-defined manual tracings are recommended for highest performance in fully automated hippocampus segmentation.

AB Attentive behavior requires the ability to perform in the face of distraction. Distracting information can cause conflict at any level along the information processing stream. However, it is not yet known whether the brain has distinct subsystems dedicated to detecting and resolving these different forms of distraction. Although previous studies have localized brain activity during semantic and response conflict, no prior study has specifically determined whether these activations occur in distinct or overlapping regions. We used a modified version of the Stroop color-word task, by which we were able to separate semantic from response conflict. Behavioral data indicate that these two kinds of conflict both contribute to the overall Stroop interference effect, while fMRI data indicate that they elicit non-overlapping activation in anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal brain regions. These results suggest that the brain has distinct but parallel attentional mechanisms for resolving these different forms of cognitive interference. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to detect an error in one's own performance and then to improve ongoing performance based on this error processing is critical for effective behaviour. In our event-related fMRI experiment, we show that explicit awareness of a response inhibition commission error and subsequent post-error behaviour were associated with bilateral prefrontal and parietal brain activation. Activity in the anterior cingulate region, typically associated with error detection, was equivalent for both errors subjects were aware of and those they were not aware of making. While anterior cingulate activation has repeatedly been associated with error-related processing, these results suggest that, in isolation, it is not sufficient for conscious awareness of errors or post-error adaptation of response strategies. Instead, it appears, irrespective of awareness, to detect information about stimuli/responses that requires interpretation in other brain regions for strategic implementation of post-error adjustments of behaviour.

AB Abnormalities in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) have been reported to characterize depressive episodes; they are at least partly reversed by antidepressant treatment. Treatment-specific as well as response-related changes in rCBF have been reported. We explored the changes in rCBF induced by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), a recently proposed antidepressant strategy, by application of single photon emission-computed tomography with Tc-99m-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime in otherwise treatment-refractory patients. Both region-of-interest (ROI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analytic approaches were used. Decreases of rCBF in the amygdala, left hippocampus, left subgenual cingulate cortex, left and right ventral anterior cingulum, right thalamus and brain stem were observed; the only increase of rCBF was found by SPM analysis in the middle frontal gyrus. This pattern shares features with changes of rCBF previously associated with the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Similarities to other brain-stimulation strategies in antidepressant treatment were less pronounced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies have suggested that teens with alcohol use disorder (AUD) can demonstrate memory deficits, but the underlying neuroanatomical substrates are unclear. The hippocampus is crucial to intact memory functioning, and it actively develops during adolescence. The current study attempted to replicate and extend previous findings suggesting that adolescents with AUD show smaller hippocampal volumes than healthy adolescents. Manual tracings of bilateral hippocampi were performed on structural magnetic resonance images of 14 adolescents (ages 15 to 17 years) with AUD and 17 healthy comparison teens. Intracranial, white, and gray matter volumes, as well as memory abilities, were also measured. Results revealed that adolescents with AUD had significantly smaller left hippocampal volumes than healthy teens, even after removal of teens with comorbid conduct disorder from the analyses. In contrast, the groups did not differ in right hippocampal, intracranial, gray or white matter volumes, or memory performance. Hippocampal volumes were not related to alcohol-consumption rates. These findings indicate that adolescents with AUD, but free from other psychiatric comorbidities, have reduced left hippocampal volume. Because hippocampal volume did not relate to alcohol use characteristics, it is possible that premorbid volumetric differences could account for some of the observed group differences in hippocampal volume.

AB The spatial extent of the changes in oxy-hemoglobin (HbO), deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), total hemoglobin concentration (HbT), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in response to forepaw and whisker stimulation were compared in the rat somatosensory cortex using a combination of multi-wavelength reflectance imaging and laser speckle contrast imaging of cerebral blood flow. The spatial extents of the response of each hemodynamic parameter and CMRO2 were found to be comparable at the time of peak response, and at early times following stimulation onset, the spatial extent of the change in HbR was smaller than that of HbO, HbT, CBF, and CMR02- In addition, a slight spatial dependence was found in the power law coefficient relating changes in CBF and HbT. Although the CMRO2 response is a metabolic measure and thus expected to have a more localized response than the hemodynamic parameters, the results presented here suggest that this may not be the case in general, possibly due to the increased sensitivity of optical imaging techniques to superficial cortical layers where the lateral extent of the metabolic and neuronal activation is larger compared to that in layer IV. In addition, we found that the measured spatial extent of the CMRO2 changes was insensitive to assumptions made in the calculation of the CMRO2 changes such as baseline hemoglobin concentrations, vascular weighting constants, and wavelength dependence of tissue scattering. Multi-parameter full field imaging of the functional response provides a more complete picture of the hemodynamic response to functional activation including the spatial and temporal estimation of CMRO2 changes.

AB The ability to inhibit inappropriate responses is central to cognitive control, but whether the same brain mechanisms mediate inhibition across different tasks is not known. We present evidence for a common set of frontal and parietal regions engaged in response inhibition across three tasks: a go/no-go task, a flanker task, and a stimulus -response compatibility task. Regions included bilateral anterior insula/frontal operculum and anterior prefrontal, right dorsolateral and premotor, and parietal cortices. Insula activity was positively correlated with interference costs in behavioral performance in each task. Principal components analysis showed a coherent pattern of individual differences in these regions that was also positively correlated with performance in all three tasks. However, correlations among tasks were low, for both brain activity and performance. We suggest that common interference detection and/or resolution mechanisms are engaged across tasks, and that inter-task correlations in behavioral performance are low because they conflate measurements of common mechanisms with measurements of individual biases unique to each task.

AB We show that during visual working memory, the electroencephalographic (EEG) process producing 5-7 Hz frontal midline theta (fm theta) activity exhibits multiple spectral modes involving at least three frequency bands and a wide range of amplitudes. The process accounting for the fm theta increase during working memory was separated from 71-channel data by clustering on time/frequency transforms of components returned by independent component analysis (ICA). Dipole models of fm theta component scalp maps were consistent with their generation in or near dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. From trial to trial, theta power of fm theta components varied widely but correlated moderately with theta power in other frontal and left temporal processes. The weak mean increase in frontal midline theta power with increasing memory load, produced entirely by the fm theta components, largely reflected progressively stronger theta activity in a relatively small proportion of trials. During presentations of letter series to be memorized or ignored, fm theta components also exhibited 1215 Hz low-beta activity that was stronger during memorized than during ignored letter trials, independent of letter duration. The same components produced a brief 3-Hz burst 500 ms after onset of the probe letter following each letter sequence. A new decomposition method, log spectral ICA, applied to normalized log time/frequency transforms of fm theta component Memorize-letter trials, showed that their low-beta activity reflected harmonic energy in continuous, sharppeaked theta wave trains as well as independent low-beta bursts. Possibly, the observed fm theta process variability may index dynamic adjustments in medial frontal cortex to trial-specific behavioral context and task demands. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Pain perception is a multidimensional phenomenon, derived from sensory, affective, cognitive-evaluative and homeostatic information. Neuroimaging studies of pain perception have investigated the role of primary somatosensory cortex (SI); however, they have typically failed to demonstrate the expected somatotopy. An alternative network for the sensory component of pain has been proposed, involving a temperature and pain-specific nucleus of the thalamus (VMpo) and its projections to dorsal posterior insula (dpIns). According to this hypothesis, projections to the insula should be arranged somatotopically. In order to test for the presence of somatotopy in the operculo-insular brain region, we delivered moderately painful thermal stimuli to the right face, hand and foot in 14 healthy subjects and recorded brain responses using high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. For each subject, the thermode temperature was adjusted to produce pain ratings of 5 to 6 out of 10, which corresponded to average temperatures for the face, hand and foot of 49.6, 48.5 and 48.5 degrees C, respectively. Examination of mixed effects group activation maps suggested a pain-related somatotopy in the contralateral posterior insula and putamen. Construction of frequency maps revealed that face activation within the posterior insula was anterior to both hand and foot, whilst foot activation was located medially in the circular sulcus. Single subject analysis demonstrated that only coordinates for dpIns activation were significantly dependent on stimulus location (Hotelling's Trace, P = 0.012). Coordinates for face (paired t test, P = 0.004) and hand (P < 0.001) activity were more lateral than those for foot, whilst face activation was anterior to the foot (P = 0.037). Based on single subject analyses, the average standard space (MNI) coordinates for face, hand and foot activity were (-40,-16,11), (-40,-19,14) and (-35,-21,11) respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Several neuroimaging studies have reported 'hypofrontality' in depressed patients performing a cognitive challenge compared to control subjects. Hypofrontality in depression is likely associated with an impaired behavioral performance. It is unclear whether this impaired performance is the consequence or the cause of hypofrontality. Consequently, we proposed to compare the cerebral activity of depressed patients and healthy subjects while controlling for the level of performance. Ten individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression and 10 healthy controls were tested with a verbal version of the n-back task during fMRI scanning. The working memory load was manipulated across the experiment (1,2,3-back) to increase the cognitive demands. fMRI data were acquired on a 1.5-T GE scanner and analyzed using SPM99 software. We did not find any difference between groups in both performance and reaction times for each level of complexity of the n-back task. Depressed patients and control subjects showed bilateral activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Activation of these regions was modulated by the complexity of the task. Within this n-back neural network, depressed patients showed greater activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate compared to healthy subjects. This study provides evidence that depressed patients need greater activation within the same neural network to maintain a similar level of performance as controls during a working memory task. Our findings suggest that depression may impair the cognitive capacity of depressed patients by recruiting more brain resources than controls during cognitive control. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB In vivo study of white matter microstructural integrity through magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) permits examination of degradation of axonal circuitry that may underlie functional decline of frontally-based processes in normal adult aging. Determination of the pattern of age-related degradation of white matter microstructure requires quantitative comparison of the rostral-caudal and superior-inferior extents of the brain's white matter. To date, this has not been accomplished, probably because of significant artifacts from spatial distortion and poor signal resolution that precludes accurate analysis in prefrontal and inferior brain regions. Here, we report a profile analysis of the integrity of white matter microstructure across the supratentorium and in selected focal regions using DTI data collected at high-field strength (3 T), with isotropic voxel acquisition, and an analysis based on a concurrently-acquired field map to permit accurate quantification of artifact-prone, anterior and inferior brain regions. The groups comprised 10 younger and 10 older individuals; all were high functioning, highly educated, and in excellent health. The DTI profile analysis revealed a robust frontal distribution of low white matter anisotropy and high bulk mean diffusivity in healthy older compared with younger adults. In contrast to frontal fiber systems, posterior systems were largely preserved with age. A second analysis, based on focal samples of FA, confirmed that the age-related EA decline was restricted to frontal regions, leaving posterior and inferior brain regions relatively intact. The selective decline of anterior anisotropy with advancing age provides evidence for the potential of a microstructural white matter mechanism for the commonly observed decline in frontally-based functions.

AB The differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders can be challenging, especially early in the disease course. PET imaging with [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been used to identify characteristic patterns of regional glucose metabolism in patient cohorts with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as variant forms of parkinsonism such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBGD). In this study, we assessed the utility of FDG PET in the differential diagnosis of individual patients with clinical parkinsonism.
   135 parkinsonian patients were referred for FDG PET to determine whether their diagnosis could be made accurately based upon their scans. Imaging-based diagnosis was obtained by visual assessment of the individual scans and also by computer-assisted interpretation. The results were compared with 2-year follow-up clinical assessments made by independent movement disorders specialists who were blinded to the original PET findings.
   We found that blinded computer assessment agreed with clinical diagnosis in 92.4% of all subjects (97.7% early PD, 91.6% late PD, 96% MSA, 85% PSP, 90.1% CBGD, 86.5% healthy control subjects). Concordance of visual inspection with clinical diagnosis was achieved in 85.4% of the patients scanned (88.4% early PD, 97.2% late PD, 76% MSA, 60% PSP, 90.9% CBGD, 90.9% healthy control subjects). This study demonstrates that FDG PET performed at the time of initial referral for parkinsonism accurately predicted the clinical diagnosis of individual patients made at subsequent follow-up. Computer-assisted methodologies may be particularly helpful in situations where experienced readers of FDG PET images are not readily available. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper treats support vector machine (SVM) classification applied to block design fMRI, extending our previous work with linear discriminant analysis [LaConte, S., Anderson, J., Muley, S., Ashe, J., Frutiger, S., Rehm, K., Hansen, L.K., Yacoub, E., Hu, X., Rottenberg, D., Strother, S., 2003a.

The quantitative evaluation of functional neuroimaging experiments: the NPAIRS data analysis framework. NeuroImage 15, 747-771]. We compare SVM to canonical variates analysis (CVA) by examining the relative sensitivity of each method to ten combinations of preprocessing choices consisting of spatial smoothing, temporal detrending, and motion correction. Important to the discussion are the issues of classification performance, model interpretation, and validation in the context of fMRI. As the SVM has many unique properties, we examine the interpretation of support vector models with respect to neuroimaging data. We propose four methods for extracting activation maps from SVM models, and we examine one of these in detail. For both CVA and SVM, we have classified individual time samples of whole brain data, with TRs of roughly 4 s, thirty slices, and nearly 30,000 brain voxels, with no averaging of scans or prior feature selection.

AB Persistent dose-related cognitive decrements have been reported in 28-day abstinent heavy marijuana (MJ) users. However, the neural substrates of these decrements in cognitive performance are not known. This study aimed to determine if 25-day abstinent MJ users show persistent dose-related alterations in performance and brain activity using PET (H2O)-O-15 during the Iowa Gambling Task-IGT (a decision-making task). Eleven heavy MJ users and 11 non-drug users participated. The MJ group resided in an inpatient research unit at the NIH/NIDA-IRP for 25 days prior to testing to ensure abstinence. A dose-related association was found between increased MJ use and lower IGT performance and alterations in brain activity. The MJ group showed greater activation in the left cerebellum and less activation in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than the Control group. When the MJ group was divided into Moderate (8-35 joints/week) and Heavy users (53-84 joints/week), the Heavy MJ group showed less activation in the left medial OFC and greater activation in the left cerebellum than the Moderate group. However, brain activity and task performance were similar between the Moderate MJ users and the Control group, suggesting a "threshold effect". These preliminary findings indicate that very heavy users of MJ have persistent decision-making deficits and alterations in brain activity. Specifically the Heavy MJ users may focus on only the immediate reinforcing aspects of a situation (i.e., getting high) while ignoring the negative consequences. Thus, faulty decision-making could make an individual more prone to addictive behavior and more resistant to treatment. Finally, it is unclear if these neurologic findings will become progressively worse with continued heavy MJ use or if they will resolve with abstinence from MJ use. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Hyperintense lesions in both white matter and gray matter on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are associated with late-life depression. This large study examined differences in gray and white matter lesion volumes on brain MRl between 253 elderly depressed and 146 control subjects. White matter and gray matter lesion volumes were measured in each hemisphere using a semi-automated segmentation process and compared against depression status. Depressed subjects exhibited significantly greater total white matter (mean 7.22 ml) and gray matter (mean 0.30 ml) lesion volumes in both hemispheres than did control subjects (mean 4.87 ml in white matter and 0.18 ml in gray matter). This difference remained statistically significant even after controlling for confounders such as age, sex, race and reports of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease. Patients with late-life depression have larger white matter lesion and gray matter lesion volumes than do control subjects. Future research should combine similar volumetric techniques with methods of identifying the location of lesions specific to late-life depression. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aging is associated with a decline in both cognitive and motor abilities that reflects deterioration of underlying brain circuitry. While age-related alterations have also been described in brain regions underlying emotional behavior (e.g., the amygdala), the functional consequence of such changes is less clear. To this end, we used blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore age-related changes in brain regions underlying emotion processing. Twelve young (age < 30 years) and 14 elderly subjects (age > 60 years) were studied with BOLD fMRI during a paradigm that involved perceptual processing of fearful and threatening stimuli. Consistent with previous reports, direct group comparisons revealed relatively increased BOLD fMRI responses in prefrontal cortical regions, including Broca's area, and relatively decreased responses in the amygdala and posterior fusiform gyri in elderly subjects. Importantly, additional analyses using an elderly-specific brain template for spatial normalization of the elderly BOLD fMRI data confirmed these divergent regional response patterns. While there was no difference between groups in accuracy on the task, elderly subjects were significantly slower (delayed reaction times) in performing the task. Our current data suggest that elderly subjects engage a more distributed neocortical network during the perceptual processing of emotional facial expressions. In light of recent converging data froth two other studies, our observed effects may reflect age-related compensatory responses and/or alternative strategies in processing emotions, as the elderly appear to engage cognitive/linguistic systems in the context of reduced sensory and/or limbic responses.

AB Morphology of the corpus callosum (CC) at the mid-sagittal level has been a target of extensive studies. However, the lack of internal structures and its polymorphism make it a challenging task to quantitatively analyze shape differences among subjects. In this paper, diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI) and tract tracing technique were applied to incorporate cortical connectivity information to the morphological study. The CC was parcellated into six major subdivisions based on trajectories to different cortical areas. This subdivision was performed for eight normal subjects and one stroke patient. The parcellated CCs of the normal subjects were normalized for morphological analysis. When comparing the stroke patient to the normal population, we detected significant atrophy in the motor and sensory areas of the patient CC, in line with the clinical deficits. This approach provides a new tool to investigate callosal morphology and functional relationships. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present fMRI study aimed at identifying neural correlates of the syntax-semantics interface in language comprehension. This was achieved by examining what we refer to as "argument hierarchy construction", i.e., determining which participant in a sentence is the "Actor" and which is the "Undergoer" of the event expressed by the verb. In order to identify the neural bases of argument hierarchy processing, we manipulated three factors known to influence the complexity of argument hierarchy construction in German, namely argument order, verb class and morphological ambiguity. Increased argument hierarchization demands engendered enhanced activation in a network of inferior frontal, posterior superior temporal, premotor and parietal areas. Moreover, components of this network were differentially modulated by the individual factors. In particular, the left posterior superior temporal sulcus showed an enhanced sensitivity for morphological information and the syntactic realization of the verb-based argument hierarchy, while the activation of the left inferior frontal gyros (pars opercularis) corresponded to linearization demands and was independent of morphological information. We therefore argue that, for German, posterior superior temporal and inferior frontal regions engage in the extraction of actorhood fro m morphosyntactic structure and in the sequential realization of hierarchical interpretive dependencies, respectively.

AB Previous studies have shown that under some conditions, noise fluctuations in an fMRI time-course are dominated by physiological modulations of the image intensity with secondary contributions from thermal image noise and that these two sources scale differently with signal intensity, susceptibility weighting (TE) and field strength. The SNR of the fMRI time-course was found to be near its asymptotic limit for moderate spatial resolution measurements at 3 T with only marginal gains expected from acquisition at higher field strengths. In this study, we investigate the amplitude of image intensity fluctuations in the fMRI time-course at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T as a function of image resolution, flip angle and TE. The time-course SNR was a similar function of the image SNR regardless of whether the image SNR was modulated by flip angle, image resolution, or field strength. For spatial resolutions typical of those currently used in fMRI (e.g., 3 x 3 x 3 mm(3)), increases in image SNR obtained from 7 T acquisition produced only modest increases in time-course SNR. At this spatial resolution, the ratio of physiological noise to thermal image noise was 0.61, 0.89, and 2.23 for 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T. At a resolution of 1 x 1 x 3 mm(3), however, the physiological to thermal noise ratio was 0.34, 0.57, and 0.91 for 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T for TE near T2*. Thus, by reducing the signal strength using higher image resolution, the ratio of physiologic to image noise could be reduced to a regime where increased sensitivity afforded by higher field strength still translated to improved SNR in the fMRI time-series.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate whether neurological symptoms related to a specific axonal fiber tract in brain white matter were associated with a higher degree of tissue damage in that region, in patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis. To this end, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to segment and evaluate the fiber bundle of interest was implemented, taking care to circumvent the problems caused by pathology. Diffusion tensor (DT) MRI tractography was used to construct, from healthy volunteer data, a probability map for the pyramidal tract (PYT), and this map was applied to patients to calculate DT-derived metrics inside the PYT.
   In CIS patients with clinical symptoms related to motor function, the DT-derived mean diffusivity and the lesion volume in the PYT were found to be increased, while the fractional anisotropy was no different, when compared to those patients without motor symptoms. These results may be explained by several microstructural changes in the damaged tissue, such as changes in the permeability of axonal cell membranes, decreases of axonal density and edema.
   The approach taken to analyze a specific fiber tract was possible because the axons in the tract have a high orientational coherence, allowing tissue structure changes to be isolated from the tissue architecture. Its extension to other white matter fiber bundles is therefore limited to bundles with high orientational coherence. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Meta-analysis is an important tool for interpreting results of functional neuroimaging studies and is highly influential in predicting and testing new outcomes. Although traditional label-based review can be used to search for agreement across multiple studies, a new function-location meta-analysis technique called activation likelihood estimation (ALE) offers great improvements over conventional methods. In ALE, reported foci are modeled as Gaussian functions and pooled to create a statistical whole-brain image. ALE meta-analysis and the label-based review were used to investigate the Stroop task in normal subjects, a paradigm known for its effect of producing conflict and response inhibition due to subjects' tendency to perform word reading as opposed to color naming. Both methods yielded similar activation patterns that were dominated by response in the anterior cingulate and the inferior frontal gyros. ALE showed greater involvement of the anterior cingulate as compared to that in the label-based technique; however, this was likely due to the increased spatial level of distinction allowed with the ALE method. With ALE, further analysis of the anterior cingulate revealed evidence for somatotopic mapping within the rostral and caudal cingulate zones, an issue that has been the source of some conflict in previous reviews of the anterior cingulate cortex.

AB A quantitative meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method was used to investigate the brain basis of the Wisconsin Card-Sorting Task (WCST) and two hypothesized component processes, task switching and response suppression. All three meta-analyses revealed distributed frontoparietal activation patterns consistent with the status of the WCST as an attention-demanding executive task. The WCST was associated with extensive bilateral clusters of reliable cross-study activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Task switching revealed a similar, although less robust, frontoparietal pattern with additional clusters of activity in the opercular region of the ventral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally. Response-suppression tasks, represented by studies of the go/no-go paradigm, showed a large and highly right-lateralized region of activity in the right prefrontal cortex. The activation patterns are interpreted as reflecting a neural fractionation of the cognitive components that must be integrated during the performance of the WCST. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Human vision is an active process that involves shifting attention across the visual scene, with or without moving the eyes. Such shifts of attention can be generated at will (endogenously) or be triggered automatically, i.e., generated in response to exogenous stimuli including socially relevant cues such as someone else's gaze. What are the common and distinct brain mechanisms involved in these processes? To address this question, we carried out a quantitative effect-location meta-analysis of 59 brain-imaging experiments whose results were published using standardized coordinates. For each condition of interest, namely voluntary and visually triggered eye movements, voluntary and visually triggered (covert) shifts of attention, and perception of someone else's gaze, we computed activation likelihood estimation (ALE) maps. Those maps represent at each voxel of the brain the probability of reporting a signal change related to the condition of interest. For eye movements, this analysis confirmed the spatial location of the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, and parietal saccade-related regions. The map of covert shifts of attention demonstrated highest similarity with the map of saccadic eve movements. Gaze perception showed common activation likelihood with the other conditions in the right intraparietal sulcus and in the lateral precentral gyrus. It demonstrated more similarity with the reflexive than with the voluntary saccades and shifts of attention. We propose that a core network of frontoparietal and temporal brain regions is recruited when we shift the focus of our attention with or without eye movements in response to the appearance of a visual target, as well as when we see someone else shift his or her gaze.

AB Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) has greatly advanced voxel-based meta-analysis research in the field of functional neuroimaging. We present two improvements to the ALE method. First, we evaluate the feasibility of two techniques for correcting for multiple comparisons: the single threshold test and a procedure that controls the false discovery rate (FDR). To test these techniques, foci from four different topics within the literature were analyzed: overt speech in stuttering subjects, the Color-word Stroop task, picture-naming tasks, and painful stimulation. In addition, the performance of each thresholding method was tested on randomly generated foci. We found that the FDR method more effectively controls the rate of false positives in meta-analyses of small or large numbers of foci. Second, we propose a technique for making statistical comparisons of ALE meta-analyses and investigate its efficacy on different groups of foci divided by task or response type and random groups of similarly obtained foci. We then give an example of how comparisons of this sort may lead to advanced designs in future meta-analytic research. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This paper discusses the location bias and the spatial resolution in the reconstruction of a single dipole source by various spatial filtering techniques used for neuromagnetic imaging. We first analyze the location bias for several representative adaptive and non-adaptive spatial filters using their resolution kernels. This analysis theoretically validates previously reported empirical findings that standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) has no location bias. We also find that the minimum-variance spatial filter does exhibit bias in the reconstructed location of a single source, but that this bias is eliminated by using the normalized lead field. We then focus on the comparison of sLORETA and the lead-field normalized minimum-variance spatial filter, and analyze the effect of noise on source location bias. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the measurements determines whether the sLORETA reconstruction has source location bias, while the lead-field normalized minimum-variance spatial filter has no location bias even in the presence of noise. Finally, we compare the spatial resolution for sLORETA and the minimum-variance filter, and show that the minimum-variance filter attains much higher resolution than sLORETA does. The results of these analyses are validated by numerical experiments as well as by reconstructions based on two sets of evoked magnetic responses. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigates the functional neuroanatomy of music perception with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Three different subject groups were investigated to examine developmental aspects and effects of musical training: 10-year-old children with varying degrees of musical training, adults without formal musical training (nonmusicians), and adult musicians. Subjects made judgements on sequences that ended on chords that were music-syntactically either regular or irregular. In adults, irregular chords activated the inferior frontal gyrus, orbital frontolateral cortex, the anterior insula, ventrolateral premotor cortex, anterior and posterior areas of the superior temporal gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus, and the supramarginal gyrus. These structures presumably form different networks mediating cognitive aspects of music processing (such as processing of musical syntax and musical meaning, as well as auditory working memory), and possibly emotional aspects of music processing. In the right hemisphere, the activation pattern of children was similar to that of adults. In the left hemisphere, adults showed larger activations than children in prefrontal areas, in the supramarginal gyrus, and in temporal areas. In both adults and children, musical training was correlated with stronger activations in the frontal operculum and the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a novel data smoothing and analysis framework for cortical thickness data defined on the brain cortical manifold. Gaussian kernel smoothing, which weights neighboring observations according to their 3D Euclidean distance, has been widely used in 3D brain images to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. When the observations fie on a convoluted brain surface, however-, it is more natural to assign the weights based on the geodesic distance along the surface. We therefore develop a framework for geodesic distance-based kernel smoothing and statistical analysis on the cortical manifolds. As an illustration, we apply our methods in detecting the regions of abnormal cortical thickness in 16 high functioning autistic children via random field based multiple comparison correction that utilizes the new smoothing technique.

AB Reading is a complex cognitive skill that requires the coordination of multiple brain regions. Although functional neuroimaging studies highlight the cortical brain regions associated with a specific cognitive task like reading, they do not directly address the underlying neural connections necessary for efficient performance of this task. Adults with reading disability have demonstrated lower regional white matter connectivity, but it is not known whether this relationship between neuronal wiring and reading performance also holds in younger readers. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) that highlights the structural integrity of the brain wiring, we show that regional brain connectivity in the left temporo-parietal white matter correlates with a wide range of reading ability in children as young as 8-12 years old. Diffusion tensor tractography suggests that the posterior limb of the internal capsule is consistent with the location of the largest cluster of correlation between reading ability (Word Identification subtest) and fractional anisotropy. The maturation of the white matter may play a key role in the development of cognitive processes such as reading. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescents' propensity for risk-taking and reward-seeking behaviors suggests a heightened sensitivity for reward, reflected by greater feedback-related activity, changes in reward circuitry (e.g., nucleus accumbens), ane/or a lower sensitivity to potential harm reflected by weaker feedback-related activity changes in avoidance circuitry (e.g., amygdala) relative to adults. Responses of nucleus accumbens and amygdala to valenced outcomes (reward receipt and reward omission) were assayed using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure paired with a monetary reward task in 14 adults and 16 adolescents. Bilateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens showed significantly greater activation when winning than when failing to win in both groups. Group comparisons revealed stronger activation of left nucleus accumbens by adolescents, and of left amygdala by adults. When examining responses to reward receipts and to reward omissions separately. the most robust group difference was within the amygdala during reward omission. The reduction of the fMRI BOLD signal in the amygdala in response to reward omission was larger for adults than for adolescents. Correlations showed a close link between negative emotion and amygdala decreased BOLD signal in adults, anti between positive emotion and nucleus accumbens activation in adolescents. Overall, these findings support the notion that the signal differences between positive and negative outcomes involve the nucleus accumbens more in adolescents than in adults, and the amygdala more in adults than in adolescents. These developmental differences, if replicated, may have important: implications for the development of early-onset disorders of emotion and motivation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Structural deformity of the hippocampus is characteristic of individuals with very mild and mild forms of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The purpose of this study was to determine whether a similar deformity of the hippocampus can predict the onset of dementia in nondemented elders. Using high dimensional diffeomorphic transformations of a neuroanatomical template, hippocampal volumes and surfaces were defined in 49 nondemented elders; the hippocampal surface was subsequently partitioned into three zones (i.e., lateral, superior and inferior-medial), which were proximal to the underlying CA1 subfield, CA2-4 subfields plus dentate gyrus, and subiculum, respectively. Annual clinical assessments using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), where CDR 0 indicates no dementia and CDR 0.5 indicates very mild dementia, were then performed for a mean of 4.9 years (range 0.9-7.1 years) to monitor subjects who converted from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Inward variation of the lateral zone and left hippocampal volume significantly predicted conversion to CDR 0.5 in separate Cox proportional hazards models. When hippocampal surface variation and volume were included in a single model, inward variation of the lateral zone of the left hippocampal surface was selected as the only significant predictor of conversion. The pattern of hippocampal surface deformation observed in nondemented subjects who later converted to CDR 0.5 was similar to the pattern of hippocampal surface deformation previously observed to discriminate subjects with very mild DAT and nondemented subjects. These results suggest that inward deformation of the left hippocampal surface in a zone corresponding to the CA1 subfield is an early predictor of the onset of DAT in nondemented elderly subjects.

AB Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the effects of inspired hypoxic, hyperoxic, and hypercapnic gases on baseline and stimulus-evoked changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in spontaneously breathing rats under isoflurane anesthesia. Each animal was subjected to a baseline period of six inspired gas conditions (9% O-2, 12% O-2, 21% O-2, 100% O-2, 5% CO2, and 10% CO2) followed by a superimposed period of forepaw stimulation. Significant stimulus-evoked fMRI responses were found in the primary somatosensory cortices. Relative fMRI responses to forepaw stimulation varied across gas conditions and were dependent on baseline physiology, whereas absolute fMRI responses were similar across moderate gas conditions (12% 02, 21% 02 100% 02, and 5% CO2) and were relatively independent of baseline physiology. Consistent with data obtained using well-established techniques, baseline and stimulus-evoked CMRO2 were invariant across moderate physiological perturbations thereby supporting a CMRO2-fMRI technique for non-invasive CMRO2 measurement. However, under 9% O-2 and 10% CO2, Stimulus-evoked CBF and BOLD were substantially reduced and the CMRO2 formalism appeared invalid, likely due to attenuated neurovascular coupling and/or a failure of the model under extreme physiological perturbations. These findings demonstrate that absolute fMRI measurements help distinguish neural from non-neural contributions to the fMRI signals and may lend a more accurate measure of brain activity during states of altered basal physiology. Moreover, since numerous pharmacologic agents, pathophysiological states, and psychiatric conditions alter baseline physiology independent of neural activity, these results have implications for neuroimaging studies using relative fMRI changes to map brain activity.

AB Recent hemodynamic imaging studies have shown that processing of low probability task-relevant target stimuli (i.e., oddballs) and low probability task-irrelevant novel stimuli elicit widespread activity in diverse, spatially distributed cortical and subcortical systems. The nature of this distributed response supports the model that processing of salient and novel stimuli engages many brain regions regardless of whether said regions were necessary for task performance. However, these latter neuroimaging studies largely employed small sample sizes and fixed-effect analyses, limiting the characterization and inference of the results. The present study addressed these issues by collecting a large sample size (n = 100) and employed random effects statistical models. Analyses were also conducted to determine the inter-subject reliability of the hemodynamic response and the effects of gender and age on target detection and novelty processing. Group data demonstrated highly significant activation in all 34 specified regions of interest for target detection and all 24 specified regions of interest for processing of novel stimuli. Neither age nor gender systematically influenced the results. These data are discussed within the context of a model that proposes that the mammalian brain has evolved to adopt a strategy of engaging distributed neuronal systems when processing salient stimuli despite the low probability that many of these brain regions are required for successful task performance. This process may be termed 'adaptive reflexive processing.' The implications of these results for interpreting functional MRI studies are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Some recent evidence has suggested abnormalities of the dorsal stream and possibly the mirror neuron system in autism, which may be responsible for impairments of joint attention, imitation, and secondarily for language delays. The current study investigates functional connectivity along the dorsal stream in autism, examining interregional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal cross-correlation during visuomotor coordination. Eight high-functioning autistic men and eight handedness and age-matched controls were included. Visually prompted button presses were performed with the preferred hand. For each subject, functional connectivity was computed in terms of BOLD signal correlation with the mean time series in bilateral visual area 17. Our hypothesis of reduced dorsal stream connectivity in autism was only in part confirmed. Functional connectivity with superior parietal areas was not significantly reduced. However, the autism group showed significantly reduced connectivity with bilateral inferior frontal area 44, which is compatible with the hypothesis of mirror neuron defects in autism. More generally, our findings suggest that dorsal stream connectivity in autism may not be fully functional. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Self-recognition has been demonstrated by a select number of primate species and is often used as an index of self-awareness. Whether a specialized neural mechanism for self-face recognition in humans exists remains unclear. We used event-related fMRI to investigate bra in regions selectively activated by images of one's own face. Ten right-handed normal subjects viewed digital morphs between their own face and a gender-matched familiar other presented in a random sequence. Subjects were instructed to press a button with the right hand if the image looked like their own face, and another button if it looked like a familiar or scrambled face. Contrasting the trials in which images contain more "self" with those containing more familiar "other" revealed signal changes in the right hemisphere (RH) including the inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior occipital gyros. The opposite contrast revealed voxels with higher signal intensity for images of "other" than for "self" in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Additional contrasts against baseline revealed that activity in the "self" minus "other" contrasts represent signal increases compared to baseline (null events) in "self" trials, while activity in the "other" minus "self" contrasts represent deactivations relative to baseline during "self" trials. Thus, a unique network involving frontoparietal structures described as part of the "mirror neuron systern" in the RH underlies self-face recognition, while regions comprising the "default/resting state" network deactivate less for familiar others. We provide a model that reconciles these findings and previously published work to account for the modulations in these two networks previously implicated in social cognition. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Context exerts a powerful effect on cognitive performance and is clearly important for language processing, where lexical, sentential, and narrative contexts should differentially engage neural systems that support lexical, compositional, and discourse level semantics. Equally important, but thus far unexplored, is the role of context within narrative, as cognitive demands evolve and brain activity changes dynamically as subjects process different narrative segments. In this study, we used fMRI to examine the impact of context, comparing responses to a single, linguistically matched set of texts when these were differentially presented as random word lists, unconnected sentences and coherent narratives. We found emergent, context-dependent patterns of brain activity in each condition. Perisylvian language areas were always active, consistent with their supporting core linguistic computations. Sentence processing was associated with expanded activation of the frontal operculum and temporal poles. The same stimuli presented as narrative evoked robust responses in extrasylvian areas within both hemispheres, including precuneus, medial prefrontal, and dorsal temporo-parieto-occipital cortices. The right hemisphere was increasingly active as contextual complexity increased, maximal at the narrative level. Furthermore, brain activity was dynamically modulated as subjects processed different narrative segments: left hemisphere activity was more prominent at the onset, and right hemisphere more prominent at the resolution of a story, at which point, it may support a coherent representation of the narrative as a whole. These results underscore the importance of studying language in an ecologically valid context, suggesting a neural model for the processing of discourse. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The fiber-tracking method enables in vivo visualization of the white matter tracts of the brain using a diffusion tensor MR imaging technique. While this method represents a promising tool in the field of neurosurgery, especially when confronted with brain tumors in eloquent areas, its reliability remains unknown. We present here our preliminary validation of tractography in human subjects harboring brain tumors by comparing the results produced by neuronavigation and electrical white matter stimulation in two patients with gliomas in the eloquent area. Although we were able to visualize the pyramidal tract with the fiber-tracking technique, the images failed to present the actual size of the fiber bundles. Here we discuss the advantages and limitations of fiber-tracking in the field of neurosurgery. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB While much is known about the functional architecture of the visual system, little is known about its large-scale dynamics during perception. This study describes this dynamics with a high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. We recorded depth EEG of epileptic patients performing a face detection task and found that the stimuli induced strong modulations in the gamma band (40 Hz to 200 Hz) in selective occipital, parietal and temporal sites, in particular the fusiform gyros, the lateral occipital gyros and the intra-parietal sulcus. Occipito-temporal sites were the first to be activated, closely followed by the parietal sites, while portions of the primary visual cortex seemed to deactivate temporarily. Some of those effects were found to be correlated across distant sites, suggesting that a coordinated balance between regional gamma activations and deactivations could be involved during visual perception.

AB This study used positron emission tomography (PET) to identify the brain substrate of self-referential reflective activity and to investigate its relationship with brain areas that are active during the resting state. Thirteen healthy volunteers performed reflective tasks pertaining to three different matters (the self, another person, and social issues) while they were scanned. Rest scans were also acquired, in which subjects were asked to simply relax and not think in a systematic way. The mental activity experienced during each scan was assessed with rating scales. The results showed that, although self-referential thoughts were most frequent during the self-referential task, some self-referential reflective activity also occurred during rest. Compared to rest, performing the reflective tasks was associated with increased blood flow in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the left anterior middle temporal gyros, the temporal pole bilaterally, and the right cerebellum; there was a decrease of blood flow in right prefrontal regions,and in medial and right lateral parietal regions. In addition, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) (1) was more active during the self-referential reflective task than during the other two reflective tasks, (2) showed common activation during rest and the self-referential task, and (3) showed a correlation between cerebral metabolism and the amount of self-referential processing. It is suggested that the VMPFC is crucial for representing knowledge pertaining to the self and that this is an important function of the resting state. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to compare the central effects of electroacupuncture at different frequencies with traditional Chinese manual acupuncture. Although not as time-tested as manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture does have the advantage of setting stimulation frequency and intensity objectively and quantifiably. Manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture at 2 Hz and 100 Hz, and tactile control stimulation were carried out at acupoint ST-36. Overall, electroacupuncture (particularly at low frequency) produced more widespread fMRI signal increase than manual acupuncture did, and all acupuncture stimulations produced more widespread responses than did our placebo-like tactile control stimulation. Acupuncture produced hemodynamic signal increase in the anterior insula, and decrease in limbic and paralimbic structures including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and the cortices of the subgenual and retrosplenial cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, frontal, and temporal poles, results not seen for tactile control stimulation. Only electroacupuncture produced significant signal increase in the anterior middle cingulate cortex, whereas 2-Hz electroacupuncture produced signal increase in the pontine raphe area. All forms of stimulation (acupuncture and control) produced signal increase in SII. These findings support a hypothesis that the limbic system is central to acupuncture effect regardless of specific acupuncture modality, although some differences do exist in the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms for these modalities, and may aid in optimizing their future usage in clinical applications.

AB We sought to determine the influence of tissue damage and the potential impact of cortical reorganization on the performance to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) in patients at the earliest stage of multiple sclerosis (MS). Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments using PASAT as paradigm were carried out in 18 patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS (CISSMS) compared to 18 controls. MTR histogram analyses showed structural abnormalities in patients involving the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) but also the gray matter (GM). Mean PASAT scores were significantly lower in the group of patients taken as a whole, and were correlated with the mean NAWM MTR value. No correlation was observed between PASAT scores and GM MTR. However, in the subgroup of patients with normal PASAT performance (n = 9), fMRI showed larger activations in bilateral Brodmann area 45 (BA45) and right BA44 compared to that in controls (n = 18). In these areas with potentially compensatory reorganization, the whole group of patients (n = 18) showed significantly greater activation than controls (n = 18). Activation in the right BA45 was inversely correlated with the mean NAWM MTR and the peak position of GM MTR histograms of patients. This study indicates that even at the earliest stage of MS, cortical reorganization is present inside the executive system of working memory and could tend to limit the determinant functional impact of NAWM injury on the execution of the PASAT.

AB Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a highly prevalent genetic disorder whose manifestations include developmental disability and sometimes mental retardation. The few studies that have examined brain morphology in different samples from this population have found similar general patterns, mostly using region of interest measures. We employed voxel-based techniques to concurrently examine specific morphologic changes in multiple brain tissue measures. Results were similar to previous findings of volumetric reductions in the posterior brain. They also extended them in two ways. First, our methods provided greater specificity in the localization of changes detected. Second, the combination of our measures of gray and white matter along with cerebrospinal fluid volume and fractional anisotropy, which indicates the structure of white matter, showed a posterior displacement of and morphologic changes to the corpus callosum in affected children.

AB The ability to deceive others is a high-level social and cognitive function. It has been suggested that response conflict and cognitive control increase during deceptive acts but this hypothesis has not been evaluated directly. Using fMRI, we tested this prediction for the execution of an intentional false response. Subjects were instructed to respond truthfully or falsely to a series of yes/no questions that were also varied in autobiographical and nonautobiographical content to further examine the influence of personal relevance when lying. We observed an interference effect (longer reaction times for false versus true responses) that was accompanied by increased activation within the anterior cingulate, caudate and thalamic nuclei, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a circuit that has been implicated in response conflict and cognitive control. Behavioral and neural effects were more robust when falsifying autobiographical responses relative to nonautobiographical responses. Furthermore, a correlation between reaction time and left caudate activity supported the presence of increased response inhibition when falsifying responses. When presented with self-relevant (autobiographical) stimuli regardless of response condition, the mesial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices were recruited. Neural activity within these two regions and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also showed correlations with self-report personality measures from the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI). Overall, we conclude that the process of interference is inherent to the act of falsifying information and that the amount of conflict induced and cognitive control needed to successfully execute false responses is greater when dealing with personal information.

AB We discuss model-free analysis of multisubject or multisession FMRI data by extending the single-session probabilistic independent component analysis model (PICA; Beckmann and Smith, 2004. IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging, 23 (2) 137-152) to higher dimensions. This results in a three-way decomposition that represents the different signals and artefacts present in the data in terms of their temporal, spatial, and subject-dependent variations. The technique is derived from and compared with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC; Harshman and Lundy, 1984. In Research methods for multimode data analysis, chapter 5, pages 122-215. Praeger, New York). Using simulated data as well as data from multisession and multisubject FMRI studies we demonstrate that the tensor PICA approach is able to efficiently and accurately extract signals of interest in the spatial, temporal, and subject/session domain. The final decompositions improve upon PARAFAC results in terms of greater accuracy, reduced interference between the different estimated sources (reduced cross-talk), robustness (against deviations of the data from modeling assumptions and against overritting), and computational speed. On real FMRI 'activation' data, the tensor PICA approach is able to extract plausible activation maps, time courses, and session/subject modes as well as provide a rich description of additional processes of interest such as image artefacts or secondary activation patterns. The resulting data decomposition gives simple and useful representations of multisubject/multisession FMRI data that can aid the interpretation and optimization of group FMRI studies beyond what can be achieved using model-based analysis techniques.

AB Functional imaging and neuropsychological data suggest that interconnected brain structures including the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and caudate nucleus (CN) are involved in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but structural imaging studies investigating these regions have yielded inconclusive results. This may be due to inconsistencies in the identification of anatomical boundaries and methodologies utilised (i.e. automated vs. manual tracing). This magnetic resonance imaging study used manual tracing to measure volumes of selected brain regions (OFC. ACC and CN) in OCD patients and compared them with samples of healthy (HC) and psychiatric (schizophrenia; SCZ) controls (n=18 in each group). Concurrently, automated voxel-based analysis was also used to detect subtle differences in cerebral grey and white matter. For the OCD vs. HC comparison, there were no significant volumetric differences detected using the manual or the automated method (although the latter revealed a deficit in the subcortical white matter of the right temporal region). A direct comparison of the two patient groups showed no significant differences using the manual method. However, a moderate effect size was detected for OFC grey matter (reduced in SCZ), which was supported by findings of reduced OFC volume in the automated analysis. Automated analyses also showed reduced volumes in the dorsal (white matter) and ventral ACC (grey and white matter), as well as the left posterior cingulate (grey and white matter) in SCZ. The findings suggest that in contrast to findings in SCZ, there are very few (if any) gross structural anomalies in OCD. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goals of this study were to measure if chronic active heavy drinking is associated with brain volume loss in nontreatment seeking men and women, and to assess the effect of positive family history of problem drinking on brain structure in heavy drinkers. Automated image processing was used to analyze high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images from 49 active heavy drinkers and 49 age- and sex-matched light drinkers, yielding gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes within the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Regional brain volume measures were compared as a function of group, sex and their interaction. Within heavy drinkers, volumes were correlated with measures of alcohol consumption and compared as a function of family history of problem drinking. Deformation morphometry explored localized patterns of atrophy associated with heavy drinking or severity of drinking. We found significant gray matter volume losses, but no white matter losses, in active heavy drinkers compared with light drinkers. Women had greater gray matter and smaller white matter and CSF volumes as a percentage of intracranial vault than men. Within heavy drinkers, smaller gray matter volumes were associated with higher current levels of drinking and older age, while a positive family history of problem drinking was associated with smaller CSF volumes. Community-dwelling heavy drinkers who are not in alcoholism treatment have dose-related gray matter volume losses, and family history of problem drinking ameliorates some structural consequences of heavy drinking.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an observer-independent approach for automatic generation of volume-of-interest (VOI) brain templates to be used in emission tomography studies of the brain. The method utilizes a VOI probability map created on the basis of a database of several subjects' MR-images, where VOI sets have been defined manually. High-resolution structural MR-images and 5-HT2A receptor binding PET-images (in terms of F-18-altanserin binding) from 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with mild cognitive impairment were included for the analysis. A template including 35 VOIs was manually delineated on the subjects' MR images. Through a warping algorithm template VOI sets defined from each individual were transferred to the other subjects MR-images and the voxel overlap was compared to the VOI set specifically drawn for that particular individual. Comparisons were also made for the VOI templates 5-HT2A receptor binding values. It was shown that when the generated VOI set is based on more than one template VOI set, delineation of VOIs is better reproduced and shows less variation as compared both to transfer of a single set of template VOIs as well as manual delineation of the VOI set. The approach was also shown to work equally well in individuals with pronounced cerebral atrophy. Probability-map-based automatic delineation of VOIs is a fast, objective, reproducible, and safe way to assess regional brain values from PET or SPECT scans. In addition, the method applies well in elderly subjects, even in the presence of pronounced cerebral atrophy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can present with the clinical syndrome of semantic dementia due to a progressive loss of semantic knowledge or a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by aberrant social behaviours although frequently both co-exist. It has been assumed that the former is underpinned by damage to the temporal lobes and the latter, predominantly, by damage to the frontal lobes. Using the technique of voxel-based morphometry, we studied a group of FTD cases (n = 18) with a range of cognitive and neuropsychiatric features to correlate loss of semantic knowledge (as measured by the sum of two semantic tests) and aberrant behaviour (as measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory, NPI) with regional loss of grey matter volume. Semantic breakdown correlated with extensive loss of grey matter volume throughout the left anterior temporal lobe and less significantly with right temporal pole and subcallosal gyrus. Aberrant behaviour correlated with loss of grey matter volume in the dorso-mesial frontal lobe-paracingulate region, Brodmann areas 6/8/9-more so on the right. The frontal paracingulate correlation suggests that damage to this region may significantly contribute to the genesis of the behavioural syndrome seen in FTD. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB During acoustic communication among human beings, emotional information can be expressed both by the propositional content of verbal utterances and by the modulation of speech melody (affective prosody). It is well established that linguistic processing is bound predominantly to the left hemisphere of the brain. By contrast, the encoding of emotional intonation has been assumed to depend specifically upon right-sided cerebral structures. However, prior clinical and functional imaging studies yielded discrepant data with respect to interhemispheric lateralization and intrahemispheric localization of brain regions contributing to processing of affective prosody. In order to delineate the cerebral network engaged in the perception of emotional tone, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed during recognition of prosodic expressions of five different basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, fearful, and disgusted) and during phonetic monitoring of the same stimuli. As compared to baseline at rest, both tasks yielded widespread bilateral hemodynamic responses within frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. A comparison of the respective activation maps, however, revealed comprehension of affective prosody to be bound to a distinct right-hemisphere pattern of activation, encompassing posterior superior temporal sulcus (Brodmann Area [BA] 22), dorsolateral (BA 44/45), and orbitobasal (BA 47) frontal areas. Activation within left-sided speech areas, in contrast, was observed during the phonetic task. These findings indicate that partially distinct cerebral networks subserve processing of phonetic and intonational information during speech perception. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Most previous neuroimaging studies of sentence processing have associated Broca's area with 0 is et not syntactic processing; however, the exact nature of the processes subserved by this brain region well understood. Although some authors suggest that Brodmann area (BA) 44 of the left inferior frontal gyrus (i.e., Broca's area) is relevant for syntactic integration processes, others claim that it is associated with working memory mechanisms relevant for language processing. To dissociate these two possible functions, the present study investigated hemodynamic responses elicited while participants processed German indirect wh-questions. Activation increases were observed in left BA 44, to-ether with superior temporal areas and right hemispheric homologues for sentences with noncanonical word order, in which a verb argument was dislocated from its canonical position over a relatively long distance. In these sentences, syntactic working memory load was assumed to be greatest. In contrast, no activation increase was elicited by object-initial as opposed to subject-initial sentences that did not differ with respect to working memory costs but with respect to syntactic integration costs. These data strongly suggest that Broca's area plays a critical role in syntactic working memory during online sentence comprehension. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss. Inc.

AB The James-Lange theory of emotion proposes that automatically generated bodily reactions not only color subjective emotional experience of stimuli, but also necessitate a mechanism by which these bodily reactions are differentially generated to reflect stimulus quality. To examine this putative mechanism, we simultaneously measured brain activity and heart rate to identify regions where neural activin predicted the magnitude of heart rate responses to emotional facial expressions. Using a forewarned reaction time task, we showed that orienting heart rate acceleration to emotional face stimuli was modulated as a function of the emotion depicted. The magnitude of evoked heart rate increase, both across the stimulus set and within each emotion category, was predicted by, level of activity within a matrix of interconnected brain regions. including amygdala. insula. anterior cingulate, and brainstem. We suggest that these regions provide a substrate for translating visual perception of emotional facial expression into differential cardiac responses and thereby represent an interface for selective generation of visceral reactions that contribute to the embodied component of emotional reaction.

AB The subgenual prefrontal cortex (SGPFC) plays an important role in emotional processing. We carried out a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study comparing the volume of the SGPFC in child and adolescent bipolar patients and healthy controls. The sample consisted of 15 children and adolescents who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder (mean age S.D.=15.5 +/- 3.5 years) and 21 healthy adolescents (mean age S.D.=16.9 +/- 3.8 years). MR images were obtained with a 1.5 T GE Signa Imaging System with Signa 5.4.3 software. SGPFC volumes were measured with the semi-automated software MedX (Sensor Systems, Sterling, VA, USA). ANCOVA was performed to compare SGPFC volumes between groups, using age, gender and intra-cranial volume (ICV) as covariates. The volumes (mean +/- S.D.) of the right and left SGPFC for bipolar patients were 291.27 +/- 88.70 mm(3) and 284.86 +/- 83.98 mm(3), respectively. For healthy controls, the right and left SGPFC volumes were 284.95 +/- 73.33 mm(3) and 307.55 +/- 73.67 mm(3), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding right or left SGPFC volumes. We found no evidence of volumetric abnormalities in the SGPFC of bipolar children and adolescents. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Converging evidence has implicated the cerebellum in verbal working memory. The current fMRI study sought to further characterize cerebrocerebellar participation in this cognitive process by revealing regions of activation common to a verbal working task and an articulatory control task, as well as regions that are uniquely activated by working memory. Consistent with our model's predictions, load-dependent activations were observed in Broca's area (BA 44/6) and the superior cerebellar hemisphere (VI/CrusI) for both working memory and motoric rehearsal. In contrast, activations unique to verbal working memory were found in the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and the right inferior cerebellum hemisphere (VIIB). These findings provide evidence for two cerebrocerebellar networks for verbal working memory: a frontal/superior cerebellar articulatory control system and a parietal/inferior cerebellar phonological storage system.

AB Converging evidence suggests that hyperactivity in frontal-striatal circuits and in action-monitoring processes characterizes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It remains unclear, however, just how these abnormalities in brain function translate into the cognitive, affective, and behavioral manifestations of OCD. One possibility is that exaggerated or false error signals generated by the anterior cingulate (ACC) underlie compulsive behaviors by triggering the feeling that things are "not just right" even when no actual error has been made. Since recurrent compulsive behavior typically follows correct completion of a behavioral task (e.g., hand washing), ACC hyperactivity should be observed during correctly completed, high-conflict trials as well as during error trials. Frontal-striatal regions would also be expected to be activated during both trial types, as these regions are robustly associated with OCD across multiple neuroimaging paradigms. To test this hypothesis, 14 OCD patients and 14 matched controls completed a speeded reaction time task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Only correctly rejected, high-conflict trials produced excessive activation in both action monitoring (rostral and caudal ACC, LPFC) and frontal striatal regions (lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate, and thalamus) among OCD patients when compared to healthy controls. Portions of the posterior cingulate were also hyperactive among OCD patients. These results suggest that correctly rejected, high-conflict trials that require response inhibition may provide a better model than error trials of compulsive behaviors in OCD.

AB White matter tractography is a noninvasive method for estimating and visualizing the white matter connectivity patterns in the human brain using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Sources of experimental noise may induce errors in the measured fiber directions, which will reduce the accuracy of the estimated white matter trajectories. In this study, a statistical nonparametric bootstrap method is described for estimating the dispersion and other errors in white matter tractography results. Prior studies have derived models of tractography error using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and diffusion anisotropy of the DTI data. Tractography errors measured using bootstrap methods were generally consistent with an analytic model of tractography error except in areas where branching was evident White matter tractography with bootstrap resampling is also applied to estimate the probabilities of connection between brain regions. The approach was used to generate probabilistic connectivity maps between the cerebral peduncles and specific cortical regions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that performance on a given trial of a cognitive task is affected by the nature of previous trials. For example, conflict effects on interference tasks, such as the Stroop task, are reduced subsequent to high-conflict trials relative to low-conflict trials. This interaction effect between previous and current trial types is called "conflict adaptation" and thought to be due to processing adjustments in cognitive control. The current study aimed to identify the neural substrates of cognitive control during conflict adaptation by isolating neural correlates of reduced conflict from those of increased cognitive control. We expected cognitive control to be implemented by prefrontal cortex through context-specific modulation of posterior regions involved in sensory and motor aspects of task performance. We collected event-related fMRI data on a color-word naming Stroop task and found distinct fronto-parietal networks of current trial conflict detection and conflict adaptation through cognitive control. Conflict adaptation was associated with increased activity in left middle frontal gyrus (GFm) and superior frontal gyrus (GFs), consistent with increased cognitive control, and with decreased activity in bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, consistent with reduced response conflict. Psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) revealed that cognitive control activation in GFs and GFm was accompanied by increased functional integration with bilateral inferior frontal, right temporal and parietal areas, and the anterior cerebellum. These data suggest that cognitive control is implemented by medial and lateral prefrontal cortices that bias processes in regions that have been implicated in high-level perceptual and motor processes.

AB Risk anticipation is an important cognitive/emotional component of decision making. The Iowa Gambling Task [Bechara, A., Damasio, A.R., Damasio, H., Anderson, S.W., 1994. Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition 50, 7-15], which is the most widely used "risk-anticipation task" in clinical studies, has been demonstrated to be sensitive to lesions involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or amygdala. However, the critical neural circuitry involved in this complex task has not yet been fully clarified even in healthy subjects. Using a 3-T scanner, we performed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 14 healthy subjects performing the task. The statistical parametric mapping showed that the risk anticipation component (risky decisions minus safe decisions) exclusively activated the medial frontal gyros. Furthermore, we found a significant interindividual correlation between the task performance and the magnitude of brain activity during risky decisions. These results indicate that the Iowa Gambling Task does recruit the neural circuitry that is critical in decision making under uncertainty, particularly when subjects perceive the risk of their decision.

AB Suicide and depression are associated with reduced serotonergic neurotransmission. In suicides, there is a reduction in serotonin transporter (SERT) sites and an increase in postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in localized regions of the prefrontal cortex. In depression, there is a diffuse decrease in SERT binding throughout the dorsoventral extent of the prefrontal cortex. Serotonergic innervation of the prefrontal cortex arises predominantly from neurons in the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We, therefore, examined postmortem SERT binding and mRNA expression, as well as 5-HT1A autoreceptor binding in the DRN of 10 matched pairs of controls and depressed suicide victims. The concentration of SERT sites, SERT mRNA, and 5-HT1A binding was not different between controls and suicides (p > .05). In the DRN of suicides, the volume of tissue defined by 5-HT1A binding was 40% smaller than controls. An index of the total number of 5-HT1A receptors (receptor binding x volume of receptor distribution) was 43.3% lower in the DRN of suicides, compared with controls. The suicide group had 54% fewer DRN neurons expressing SERT mRNA compared with controls. In the serotonin neurons that expressed the SERT gene, expression per neuron was greater in suicides. Less total 5-HT1A and SERT binding is consistent with results Of in vivo studies in depression. Less feedback inhibition of serotonin DRN firing via 5-HT1A autoreceptors and enhancement of serotonin action due to less uptake of serotonin, is consistent with compensatory changes in response to hypofunction in depressed suicides.
